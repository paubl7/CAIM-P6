Machine learning models of accelerator systems (`surrogate models') are able to provide fast,
accurate predictions of accelerator physics phenomena. However, approaches to date typically
do not include measured input diagnostics, such as the initial beam distributions, which are critical
for accurately representing the beam evolution through the system. In addition, these inputs often
vary over time, and models that can account for these changing conditions are needed. Simulations
are in some cases needed to provide sufficient training data. These typically represent the designed
machine before construction; however, the behavior of the installed components may be quite different
due to changes over time or static differences that were not modeled. Therefore, surrogate models
that can leverage both simulation and measured data successfully are needed. We introduce an approach
based on convolutional neural networks that uses the drive laser distribution and scalar settings
as inputs for the Linac Coherent Light Source II injector frontend. The model is able to predict scalar
beam parameters and the transverse beam distribution downstream, taking into account the impact
of time-varying non-uniformities in the initial transverse laser distribution. We also introduce
and evaluate a transfer learning procedure for adapting the surrogate model from the simulation
domain to the measurement domain, to account for differences between the two. Applying this approach
to our test case results in a model that can predict test sample outputs within a mean absolute percent
error of 7.6%. This is a substantial improvement over the model trained only on simulations, which
has an error of 112.7% when applied to measured data. While we focus on the LCLS-II Injector frontend,
these approaches for improving ML-based online modeling of injector systems could be easily adapted
to other accelerator facilities.

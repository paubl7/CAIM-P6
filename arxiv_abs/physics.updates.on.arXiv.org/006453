We introduce wave encoded acquisition and reconstruction techniques for highly accelerated echo
planar imaging (EPI) with reduced g-factor penalty and image artifacts. Wave-EPI involves playing
sinusoidal gradients during the EPI readout while employing interslice shifts as in blipped-CAIPI
acquisitions. This spreads the aliasing in all spatial directions, thereby taking better advantage
of 3D coil sensitivity profiles. The amount of voxel spreading that can be achieved by the wave gradients
during the short EPI readout period is constrained by the slew rate of the gradient coils and peripheral
nerve stimulation (PNS) monitor. We propose to use a half-cycle sinusoidal gradient to increase
the amount of voxel spreading that can be achieved while respecting the slew and stimulation constraints.
Extending wave-EPI to multi-shot acquisition minimizes geometric distortion and voxel blurring
at high in-plane resolution, while structured low-rank regularization mitigates shot-to-shot
phase variations without additional navigators. We propose to use different point spread functions
(PSFs) for the k-space lines with positive and negative polarities, which are calibrated with a
FLEET-based reference scan and allow for addressing gradient imperfections. Wave-EPI provided
whole-brain single-shot gradient echo (GE) and multi-shot spin echo (SE) EPI acquisitions at high
acceleration factors and was combined with g-Slider slab encoding to boost the SNR level in 1mm isotropic
diffusion imaging. Relative to blipped-CAIPI, wave-EPI reduced average and maximum g-factors
by up to 1.21- and 1.37-fold, respectively. In conclusion, wave-EPI allows highly accelerated
single- and multi-shot EPI with reduced g-factor and artifacts and may facilitate clinical and
neuroscientific applications of EPI by improving the spatial and temporal resolution in functional
and diffusion imaging.

In this study, we employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve forward and inverse
problems via the Boltzmann-BGK formulation (PINN-BGK), enabling PINNs to model flows in both the
continuum and rarefied regimes. In particular, the PINN-BGK is composed of three sub-networks,
i.e., the first for approximating the equilibrium distribution function, the second for approximating
the non-equilibrium distribution function, and the third one for encoding the Boltzmann-BGK equation
as well as the corresponding boundary/initial conditions. By minimizing the residuals of the governing
equations and the mismatch between the predicted and provided boundary/initial conditions, we
can approximate the Boltzmann-BGK equation for both continuous and rarefied flows. For forward
problems, the PINN-BGK is utilized to solve various benchmark flows given boundary/initial conditions,
e.g., Kovasznay flow, Taylor-Green flow, cavity flow, and micro Couette flow for Knudsen number
up to 5. For inverse problems, we focus on rarefied flows in which accurate boundary conditions are
difficult to obtain. We employ the PINN-BGK to infer the flow field in the entire computational domain
given a limited number of interior scattered measurements on the velocity with unknown boundary
conditions. Results for the two-dimensional micro Couette and micro cavity flows with Knudsen
numbers ranging from 0.1 to 10 indicate that the PINN-BGK can infer the velocity field in the entire
domain with good accuracy. Finally, we also present some results on using transfer learning to accelerate
the training process. Specifically, we can obtain a three-fold speedup compared to the standard
training process (e.g., Adam plus L-BFGS-B) for the two-dimensional flow problems considered
in our work.

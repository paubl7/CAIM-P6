We present a unified variational mechanics framework for cavitating turbulent flows and structural
motions via a stabilized finite element formulation. To model the finite mass transfer rate in cavitation
phenomena, we employ the homogenous mixture-based approach via phenomenological scalar transport
differential equations. Stable linearizations of the finite mass transfer terms for the mass continuity
equation and the scalar transport equations are derived for robust and accurate implementation.
The linearized matrices for the cavitation equation are imparted a positivity-preserving property
to address numerical oscillations arising from high-density gradients typical of two-phase cavitating
flows. The proposed formulation is strongly coupled in a partitioned manner with an incompressible
3D Navier-Stokes finite element solver, and the unsteady problem is advanced in time using a fully-implicit
generalized-$\alpha$ time integration scheme. We first verify the implementation on the benchmark
case of Rayleigh bubble collapse. We demonstrate the accuracy and convergence of the cavitation
solver by comparing the numerical solutions with the analytical solutions of the Rayleigh-Plesset
equation for bubble dynamics. We find our solver to be robust for large time steps and the absence
of spurious oscillations in the pressure field. The cavitating flow solver is coupled with a hybrid
URANS-LES turbulence model with a turbulence viscosity corrected for the presence of vapor. We
validate the coupled solver for a very high Reynolds number turbulent cavitating flow over a NACA0012
hydrofoil section. Finally, the proposed method is solved in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
framework to study turbulent cavitating flow over a pitching hydrofoil section and the coupled
FSI results are explored for characteristic features of cavitating flows such as re-entrant jet
and periodic cavity shedding.

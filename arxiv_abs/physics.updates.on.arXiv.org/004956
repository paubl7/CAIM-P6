Hybrid modes of plasmonic nanoantennas are attractive to many applications, but excitation of
such modes by a conventional beam is not always efficient, and is sometimes impossible, due to a field-profile
mismatch between the incident light and the hybrid mode. We present a new approach for efficient
hybrid-mode excitation by constructing the incident light field in the basis of cylindrically
polarized vector beams of various higher-order spiral phases. Such basis vector beams are conveniently
described in the higher-order polarization states and Stokes parameters, with both concepts defined
locally in polar coordinates, and visualized correspondingly on the higher-order Poincar\'e
spheres. Besides the spatially inhomogeneous polarization distribution, the helical phase variation
in a higher-order vector beam is also crucial for effective coupling with a hybrid mode. The constructed
beam is tightly focused to concentrate light on sub-wavelength plasmonic nanoparticles. However,
tight focusing causes polarization transfers for each higher-order VB. Thus it is essential to
further analyze the focused field around nanoantennas so that an effective mode-matching field
profile is maintained. Through the boundary element method simulations, we demonstrate that radially
polarized beams of various orders are necessary to match and excite hybrid modes of distinct spectral
resonances in our example of a radial tetramer, and high excitation efficiencies are obtained when
the incident beams are further tightly focused. The developed vector beam decomposition and the
approach to analyze higher-order polarization states provide a general framework to shape the
focal field for efficient hybrid-mode excitation in nanoantennas.

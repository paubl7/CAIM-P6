The recent explosion of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) shows great potential
in the breakthrough of metal additive manufacturing (AM) process modeling. However, the success
of conventional machine learning tools in data science is primarily attributed to the unprecedented
large amount of labeled data-sets (big data), which can be either obtained by experiments or first-principle
simulations. Unfortunately, these labeled data-sets are expensive to obtain in AM due to the high
expense of the AM experiments and prohibitive computational cost of high-fidelity simulations.
We propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that fuses both data and first physical
principles, including conservation laws of momentum, mass, and energy, into the neural network
to inform the learning processes. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first application
of PINN to three dimensional AM processes modeling. Besides, we propose a hard-type approach for
Dirichlet boundary conditions (BCs) based on a Heaviside function, which can not only enforce the
BCs but also accelerate the learning process. The PINN framework is applied to two representative
metal manufacturing problems, including the 2018 NIST AM-Benchmark test series. We carefully
assess the performance of the PINN model by comparing the predictions with available experimental
data and high-fidelity simulation results. The investigations show that the PINN, owed to the additional
physical knowledge, can accurately predict the temperature and melt pool dynamics during metal
AM processes with only a moderate amount of labeled data-sets. The foray of PINN to metal AM shows
the great potential of physics-informed deep learning for broader applications to advanced manufacturing.

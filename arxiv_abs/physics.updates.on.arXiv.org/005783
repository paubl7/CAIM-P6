Turbulence locally created in laminar pipe flows shows sudden decay or splitting after a stochastic
waiting time. In laboratory experiments, the mean waiting time was observed to increase double-exponentially
as the Reynolds number (Re) approaches its critical value. To understand the origin of this double-exponential
increase, we perform many pipe flow direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations,
and measure the cumulative histogram of the maximum axial vorticity field over the pipe (turbulence
intensity). In the domain where the turbulence intensity is not small, we observe that the histogram
is well-approximated by the Gumbel extreme-value distribution. The smallest turbulence intensity
in this domain roughly corresponds to the transition value between the locally stable turbulence
and a meta-stable (edge) state. Studying the Re dependence of the fitting parameters in this distribution,
we derive that the time scale of the transition between these two states increases double-exponentially
as Re approaches its critical value. On the contrary, in smaller turbulence intensities below this
domain, we observe that the distribution is not sensible to the change of Re. This means that the decay
time of the meta-stable state (to the laminar state) is stochastic but Re-independent in average.
Our observation suggests that the conjecture made by Goldenfeld et al. to derive the double-exponential
increase of turbulence decay time is approximately satisfied in the range of Re we studied. We also
discuss using another extreme-value distribution, Fr\'echet distribution, instead of the Gumbel
distribution to approximate the histogram of the turbulence intensify, which reveals interesting
perspectives.

Detecting B-mode polarization anisotropies on large angular scales in the CMB polarization pattern
is one of the major challenges in modern observational cosmology since it would give us an important
evidence in favor of the inflationary paradigm and would shed light on the physics of the very early
Universe. Multi-frequency observations are required to disentangle the very weak CMB signal from
diffuse polarized foregrounds originating by radiative processes in our galaxy. The "Large Scale
Polarization Explorer" (LSPE) is an experiment that aims to constrain the ratio between the amplitudes
of tensor and scalar modes and to study the polarized emission of the Milky Way. LSPE is composed of
two instruments: SWIPE, a stratospheric balloon operating at 140, 210 and 240 GHz that will fly for
two weeks in the Northern Hemisphere during the polar night of 2021, and STRIP, a ground-based telescope
that will start to take data in early 2021 from the "Observatorio del Teide" in Tenerife observing
the sky at 43 GHz and 95 GHz. In my thesis, I show the results of the unit-level tests campaign on the
STRIP detectors that took place at "Universit\`a degli Studi di Milano Bicocca" from September
2017 to July 2018, and I present the code I developed and the simulations I performed to study the STRIP
scanning strategy. During the unit-level tests, more than 800 tests on 68 polarimeters have been
performed in order to select the 55 with the best performance in terms of central frequencies, bandwidths,
noise temperatures, white noise levels, slopes and knee frequencies. The STRIP scanning strategy
is based on spinning the telescope around the azimuth axis with constant elevation in order to overlap
the SWIPE coverage maintaining a sensitivity of 1.6 {\mu}K (on average) per sky pixels of 1{\deg}.
Individual sources will be periodically observed both for calibration and study purposes.

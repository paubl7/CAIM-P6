Objective: The aim of this study was to assess, through biological analysis, the local effects and
osseointegration of dental implants incorporating surface micro/nanofeatures compared to implants
of identical design without surface treatment. Background: Known to impact bone cell behavior,
surface chemical and topography modifications target improved osseointegration and long-term
success of dental implants. Very few studies assess the performance of implants presenting both
micro-and nanofeatures in vivo on the animal models used in preclinical studies for medical device
certification. Methods: Implant surfaces were characterized in terms of topography and surface
chemical composition. After 4 weeks and 13 weeks of implantation in sheep femoral condyles, forty
implants were evaluated through micro-computed tomography, histopathologic, and histomorphometric
analyses. Results: No local adverse effects were observed around implants. Histomorphometric
analyses showed significantly higher bone-to-implant contact in the coronal region of the surface
treated implant at week 4 and week 13, respectively 79.3$\pm$11.2% and 86.4$\pm$6.7%, compared
to the untreated implant's 68.3$\pm$8.8% and 74.8$\pm$13%. Micro-computed tomography analyses
revealed that healing patterns differed between coronal and apical regions, with higher coronal
boneto-implant contact at week 13. Histopathologic results showed, at week 13, bone healing around
the surface treated implant with undistinguishable defect margins while the untreated implant
still presented bone condensation and traces of the initial drill defect. Conclusion: Our results
suggest that the surface treated implant not only shows no deleterious effects on local tissues
but also promotes faster bone healing around the implant. (word count: 241

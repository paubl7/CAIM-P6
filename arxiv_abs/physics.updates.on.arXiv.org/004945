The dynamics of coupled nonlinear oscillator systems is often described by the classical discrete
nonlinear Schrodinger equation (DNLSE). In its simplest version, the DNLSE is made up of two terms
-- a nearest-neighbor hopping term and an on-site cubic nonlinear term. Each of the terms is preceded
by a coefficient that can take on either a positive or a negative sign. Each of the DNLSE versions is
derived from a corresponding equivalent Hamiltonian. The result is a small family of four versions
of the DNLSE Hamiltonian, each with its own associated ground state, all indeed scattered in myriad
of scientific publications. Here we present a comprehensive picture for the ground states of DNLSE
systems, summarize existing results and provide new insights. First, we classify the four DNLSE
Hamiltonians into two pairs according to the sign of the nonlinear term -- a "positive/negative
Hamiltonian pair" if the sign of the nonlinear term is positive/negative respectively. Ground
states of the positive Hamiltonian pair are discrete plane waves in either a ferromagnetic-like
or an antiferromagnetic-like configuration, depending on the sign of the hopping term. Ground
states of the negative Hamiltonian pair are either unstaggered or staggered site-centered discrete
breathers. Next, we discuss some properties of the ground states associated with the positive-Hamiltonian
pair -- entropy, temperature, correlations and stability. We extend our ground state stability
discussion to include excited plane waves. We propose to engineer a density-energy conserving
perturbation and show that under such perturbation, all excited plane waves are entropy-unstable.
For site-centered discrete breathers -- the ground states of the negative-Hamiltonian pair --
we have divided system nonlinearity into two ranges and wrote very good analytic approximations
for the breathers in each range.

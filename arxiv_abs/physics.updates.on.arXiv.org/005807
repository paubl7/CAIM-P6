The Venus Express Radio Science Experiment was part of the scientific payload of the Venus Express
spacecraft and was targeted at the investigation of Venus' atmosphere, surface, and gravity field
as well as the interplanetary medium. This paper describes the methods and the required calibrations
applied to VEX-VeRa raw radio occultation selected data used to retrieve vertical profiles of Venus'
ionosphere and neutral atmosphere. In this work we perform an independent analysis of a set of 25
VEX, single-frequency (X-band), occultations carried out in 2014, recorded in open-loop at the
NASA Deep Space Network. The calibrations are performed to correct the observed frequency for the
major noise sources and errors, since any uncalibrated effects will bias the retrieval of atmospheric
properties. We present a study on the influence of the relativistic effects on radio occultation
of Venus. The temperature differences between the relativistic and non-relativistic Doppler
shift solutions are lower than 0.5 K at 50 km altitude, and our error analysis shows that, within this
investigation, the relativity effects can safely be neglected. Our temperature, pressure and
electron density vertical profiles are in agreement with previous studies available in the literature.
Furthermore, our analysis shows that Venus' ionosphere is more influenced by the day/night condition
than the latitude variations, while the neutral atmosphere experiences the opposite. Our scientific
interpretation of these results is based on two major responsible effects: Venus' high thermal
inertia and the zonal winds. Their presence within Venus' neutral atmosphere determine why in these
regions a latitude dependence is predominant on the day/night condition. On the contrary, at higher
altitudes the two aforementioned effects are less important or null [...]

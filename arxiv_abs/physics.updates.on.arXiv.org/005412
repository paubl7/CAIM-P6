Magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) dynamos emerge in many different astrophysical situations where
turbulence is present, but the interaction between large-scale (LSD) and small-scale dynamos
(SSD) is not fully understood. We performed a systematic study of turbulent dynamos driven by isotropic
forcing in isothermal MHD with magnetic Prandtl number of unity, focusing on the exponential growth
stage. Both helical and non-helical forcing was employed to separate the effects of LSD and SSD in
a periodic domain. Reynolds numbers (Rm) up to $\approx 250$ were examined and multiple resolutions
used for convergence checks. We ran our simulations with the Astaroth code, designed to accelerate
3D stencil computations on graphics processing units (GPUs) and to employ multiple GPUs with peer-to-peer
communication. We observed a speedup of $\approx 35$ in single-node performance compared to the
widely used multi-CPU MHD solver Pencil Code. We estimated the growth rates both from the averaged
magnetic fields and their power spectra. At low Rm, LSD growth dominates, but at high Rm SSD appears
to dominate in both helically and non-helically forced cases. Pure SSD growth rates follow a logarithmic
scaling as a function of Rm. Probability density functions of the magnetic field from the growth
stage exhibit SSD behaviour in helically forced cases even at intermediate Rm. We estimated mean-field
turbulence transport coefficients using closures like the second-order correlation approximation
(SOCA). They yield growth rates similar to the directly measured ones and provide evidence of $\alpha$
quenching. Our results are consistent with the SSD inhibiting the growth of the LSD at moderate Rm,
while the dynamo growth is enhanced at higher Rm.

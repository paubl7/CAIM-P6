The present theory considers the transient evolution of the temperature and fuel mass fraction
distributions, and it can determine the critical heating power and minimum ignition energy for
successful ignition. The flame initiation process subject to central heating can be approximately
decomposed into four stages, i.e., the fast establishment of the ignition kernel, the ignition-energy-supported
flame kernel propagation, unsteady transition of the flame kernel, and quasi-steady spherical
flame propagation. Comparison between present transient theory and previous quasi-steady theory
indicates that the unsteady effects directly lead to the appearance of flame kernel establishing
stage and considerably affect the subsequent flame kernel development by lowering the flame propagation
speed. Time scale analysis is conducted, and it is found that the transient formulation completely
degenerates to the quasi-steady theory either in the neighborhood of stationary flame ball or as
approaching the planar flame. Previous quasi-steady theory shows that the critical heating power
for successful ignition is proportional to the cube of the critical flame radius. However, the critical
heating power predicted by the present transient formulation deviates this scaling law, which
can be attributed to the unsteady thermal conduction from heating center to the flame front. Furthermore,
in the transient formulation the central heating with finite duration is considered and the minimum
ignition energy is obtained. For the first time, the memory effect that persistently drives flame
propagation subsequent to central heating switching-off is examined. It is found that as the heating
power grows, the memory effect becomes increasingly important and it can greatly reduce the minimum
ignition energy.

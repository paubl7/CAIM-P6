The growth of wind generation capacities in the past decades has shown that wind energy can contribute
to the energy transition in many parts of the world. Being highly variable and complex to model, the
quantification of the spatio-temporal variation of wind power and the related uncertainty is highly
relevant for energy planners. Machine Learning has become a popular tool to perform wind-speed
and power predictions. However, the existing approaches have several limitations. These include
(i) insufficient consideration of spatio-temporal correlations in wind-speed data, (ii) a lack
of existing methodologies to quantify the uncertainty of wind speed prediction and its propagation
to the wind-power estimation, and (iii) a focus on less than hourly frequencies. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce a framework to reconstruct a spatio-temporal field on a regular grid
from irregularly distributed wind-speed measurements. After decomposing data into temporally
referenced basis functions and their corresponding spatially distributed coefficients, the
latter are spatially modelled using Extreme Learning Machines. Estimates of both model and prediction
uncertainties, and of their propagation after the transformation of wind speed into wind power,
are then provided without any assumptions on distribution patterns of the data. The methodology
is applied to the study of hourly wind power potential on a grid of $250\times 250$ m$^2$ for turbines
of 100 meters hub height in Switzerland, generating the first dataset of its type for the country.
The potential wind power generation is combined with the available area for wind turbine installations
to yield an estimate of the technical potential for wind power in Switzerland. The wind power estimate
presented here represents an important input for planners to support the design of future energy
systems with increased wind power generation.

Background: Studies on intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging are carried out with different
acquisition protocols. Purpose: Investigate the dependence of IVIM parameters on the B_0field
strength when using a bi- or triexponential model. Field Strength/Sequence: 20 volunteers were
examined at two field strengths (1.5 and 3T). Diffusion-weighted images of the abdomen were acquired
at 24 b-values ranging from 0.2 to 500 s/mm2. Assessment: ROIs were manually drawn in the liver. Data
were fitted with a bi- and a triexponential IVIM model. Resulting parameters were compared between
both field strengths. Results: At b-values below 6s/mm2, the triexponential model provided better
agreement with the data than the biexponential model. The average tissue diffusivity was D=1.22/1.00
um/ms at 1.5/3T. The average pseudo-diffusion coefficients for the biexponential model were D*=308/260um/ms
at 1.5/3T; and for the triexponential model D1*=81.3/65.9um/ms , D2*=2453/2333um/ms at 1.5/3T.
The average perfusion fractions for the biexponential model were f=0.286/0.303 at 1.5/3T; and
for the triexponential model f1=0.161/0.174 and f2=0.152/0.159 at 1.5/3T. A significant B0 dependence
was only found for the biexponential pseudo-diffusion coefficient (ANOVA/KW p=0.037/0.0453)
and tissue diffusivity (ANOVA/KW: p<0.001). Conclusion: Our experimental results suggest that
triexponential pseudo-diffusion coefficients and perfusion fractions obtained at different
field strengths could be compared across different studies using different B0. However, it is recommendable
to take the field strength into account when comparing tissue diffusivities or using the biexponential
IVIM model. Considering published values for oxygenation-dependent transversal relaxation
times of blood, it is unlikely that the two blood compartments of the triexponential model represent
venous and arterial blood.

The use of elemental analysis based on Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) combined with
Neural Networks (NN) is being evaluated as a method for assigning archaeological bone remains to
individuals. The bone samples examined originate from excavations of burials at the Cross Street
Unitarian Chapel, Manchester (United Kingdom) that date from the 17th to the 19th century. In this
study, we critically assess the influence of soil contaminants, by separating the bone elemental
fingerprint into two groups of different components prior to the NN analysis. The first group includes
elements related to the bone matrix (Ca and P) as well as elements that are regularly incorporated
in the living bone tissues (Mg, Na, Sr, and Ba). The second group includes metals with a low probability
of accumulation in living bone tissues whose presence is more likely to be related to diagenesis
and the chemical composition of the burial soil (Al, Fe, Mn). The NN analysis of the spectral data,
based on the use of an open access software, provided accurate results, indicating that it can be
a promising tool for enhancing LIBS applications in osteoarchaeology. The influence of bone diagenesis
and soil contaminants is significant. False classifications occurred exclusively in the NN analyses
that relied partially on elemental peaks from the second group of elements. Overall, the present
study indicates that discrimination between individuals through LIBS and NN analysis of bone material
in an archaeological setting is possible, but a targeted approach based on selected elements is
required and the influence of bone diagenesis will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The
proposed LIBS-NN method has potential as a tool capable for distinguishing distinct individuals
in disarticulated or commingled human skeletal assemblages particularly if combined with standard
osteometric methods.

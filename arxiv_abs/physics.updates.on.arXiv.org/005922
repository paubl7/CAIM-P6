Ensemble analysis has become an important tool for analyzing and quantifying gerrymandering;
the main idea is to generate a large, random sample of districting plans (an "ensemble") to which
any proposed plan may be compared. If a proposed plan is an extreme outlier compared to the ensemble
with regard to various redistricting criteria, this may indicate that the plan was deliberately
engineered to produce a specific outcome. A variety of methods have been used to construct ensembles
of plans, and a fundamental question that arises is: How accurately does an ensemble constructed
by a particular method represent the entire space of valid plans -- or, if a method has an inherent
bias towards particular types of plans, can this bias be identified and quantified? Recently, Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have become a predominant tool for constructing ensembles of plans.
In this paper, we focus on the MCMC method known as "ReCom," which was introduced in 2018 by the Metric
Geometry and Gerrymandering Group. This method appears to produce plans with relatively compact
districts compared to some other methods, and we sought to understand this phenomenon in greater
detail. In order to model the basic ReCom step, we constructed large ensembles of plans consisting
of two districts for two grid graphs and for the precinct graph of Boulder County, CO. We found that,
to a high degree of accuracy, the sampling probability for any particular plan is proportional to
an exponentially decaying function of a discrete measure that approximates the length of the boundary
between the two districts in the plan. This suggests a more quantitative formulation of the observation
that ReCom tends to produce relatively compact districts, and it represents an important first
step towards understanding the full sampling probability distribution associated to the ReCom
method.

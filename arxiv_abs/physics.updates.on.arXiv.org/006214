Multimode fibres are becoming increasingly attractive in optical endoscopy as they promise to
enable unparalleled miniaturisation, spatial resolution and cost as compared to conventional
fibre bundle-based counterpart. However, achieving high-speed imaging through a multimode fibre
(MMF) based on wavefront shaping has been challenging due to the use of liquid crystal spatial light
modulators with low frame rates. In this work, we report the development of a video-rate dual-modal
forward-viewing photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence endo-microscopy probe based on a MMF and
a high-speed digital micromirror device (DMD). Light transmission characteristics through the
fibre were characterised with a real-valued intensity transmission matrix algorithm, and subsequently,
optimal binary patterns were calculated to focus light through the fibre with wavefront shaping.
Raster-scanning of a tightly focused beam (1.5 {\mu}m diameter) at the distal end of the fibre was
performed for imaging. With the DMD running at 10 kHz, the PA imaging speed and spatial resolution
of were controlled by varying the scanning step size, ranging from 1 to 25 frames per second (fps)
and from 1.7 to 3 {\mu}m, respectively, over a field-of-view of 50 {\mu}m x 50 {\mu}m. High-resolution
PA images of carbon fibres, and mouse red blood cells were acquired through a MMF with high image fidelity
at unprecedented speed with MMF-based PA endoscope. The capability of dual-modal PA and fluorescence
imaging was demonstrated by imaging phantoms comparing carbon fibres and fluorescent microspheres.
We anticipate that with further miniaturisation of the ultrasound detector, this probe could be
integrated into a medical needle to guide minimally invasive procedures in several clinical contexts
including tumour biopsy and nerve blocks.

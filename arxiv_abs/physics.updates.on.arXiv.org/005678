Most applications of Bayesian Inference for parameter estimation and model selection in astrophysics
involve the use of Monte Carlo techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling.
However, they are time consuming and their convergence to posterior is difficult to determine.
In this work, we introduce variational inference (VI) as an alternative to solve astrophysics problems,
and demonstrate its usefullness for parameter estimation and model selection. Variational inference
converts the inference problem into an optimization problem by approximating the posterior from
a known family of distributions and using Kullback-Leibler divergence to characterize the difference.
It takes advantage of fast optimization techniques, which make it ideal to deal with large datasets
and makes it trivial to parallelize. We derive a new approximate evidence estimation based on variational
posterior and importance sampling technique called posterior weighted importance sampling for
evidence (PWISE), which is useful to perform Bayesian model selection. As a proof of principle,
we apply variational inference to five different problems in astrophysics, where Monte Carlo techniques
were previously used. These include assessment of significance of annual modulation in the COSINE-100
dark matter experiment, measuring exoplanet orbital parameters from radial velocity data, tests
of periodicities in measurements of Newton's constant $G$, assessing the significance of a turnover
in the spectral lag data of GRB 160625B and estimating the mass of a galaxy cluster using weak gravitational
lensing. We find that variational inference is much faster than MCMC and nested sampling techniques
for most of these problems while providing competitive results. All our analysis codes have been
made publicly available.

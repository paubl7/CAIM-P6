While information is ubiquitously generated, shared, and analyzed in a modern-day life, there
is still some controversy around the ways to asses the amount and quality of information inside a
noisy optical channel. A number of theoretical approaches based on, e.g., conditional Shannon
entropy and Fisher information have been developed, along with some experimental validations.
Some of these approaches are limited to a certain alphabet, while others tend to fall short when considering
optical beams with non-trivial structure, such as Hermite-Gauss, Laguerre-Gauss and other modes
with non-trivial structure. Here, we propose a new definition of classical Shannon information
via the Wigner distribution function, while respecting the Heisenberg inequality. Following
this definition, we calculate the amount of information in a Gaussian, Hermite-Gaussian, and Laguerre-Gaussian
laser modes in juxtaposition and experimentally validate it by reconstruction of the Wigner distribution
function from the intensity distribution of structured laser beams. We experimentally demonstrate
the technique that allows to infer field structure of the laser beams in singular optics to assess
the amount of contained information. Given the generality, this approach of defining information
via analyzing the beam complexity is applicable to laser modes of any topology that can be described
by 'well-behaved' functions. Classical Shannon information defined in this way is detached from
a particular alphabet, i.e. communication scheme, and scales with the structural complexity of
the system. Such a synergy between the Wigner distribution function encompassing the information
in both real and reciprocal space, and information being a measure of disorder, can contribute into
future coherent detection algorithms and remote sensing.

Any large-scale spiking neuromorphic system striving for complexity at the level of the human brain
and beyond will need to be co-optimized for communication and computation. Such reasoning leads
to the proposal for optoelectronic neuromorphic platforms that leverage the complementary properties
of optics and electronics. Starting from the conjecture that future large-scale neuromorphic
systems will utilize integrated photonics and fiber optics for communication in conjunction with
analog electronics for computation, we consider two possible paths towards achieving this vision.
The first is a semiconductor platform based on analog CMOS circuits and waveguide-integrated photodiodes.
The second is a superconducting approach that utilizes Josephson junctions and waveguide-integrated
superconducting single-photon detectors. We discuss available devices, assess scaling potential,
and provide a list of key metrics and demonstrations for each platform. Both platforms hold potential,
but their development will diverge in important respects. Semiconductor systems benefit from
a robust fabrication ecosystem and can build on extensive progress made in purely electronic neuromorphic
computing but will require III-V light source integration with electronics at an unprecedented
scale, further advances in ultra-low capacitance photodiodes, and success from emerging memory
technologies. Superconducting systems place near theoretically minimum burdens on light sources
(a tremendous boon to one of the most speculative aspects of either platform) and provide new opportunities
for integrated, high-endurance synaptic memory. However, superconducting optoelectronic systems
will also contend with interfacing low-voltage electronic circuits to semiconductor light sources,
the serial biasing of superconducting devices on an unprecedented scale, a less mature fabrication
ecosystem, and cryogenic infrastructure.

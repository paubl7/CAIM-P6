Context: Occultation experiments represent unique opportunities for probing remotely physical
properties of atmospheres. The data processing requires one to properly account for refractivity
while modeling the time/frequency transfers of an electromagnetic signal. On theoretical grounds,
little work have been done concerning the elaboration of a covariant approach for modeling occultation
data. Aims: We present an original method allowing one to derive up to the appropriate order fully
analytical expressions for the covariant description of time/frequency transfers during an atmospheric
occultation experiment. Methods: We make use of two independent powerful relativistic theoretical
tools, namely the optical spacetime metric, and the time transfer functions formalism. The first
one allows us to consider refractivity as spacetime curvature while the second one is used to determine
the time/frequency transfers occurring in a curved spacetime. Results: We provide the integral
form of the time transfer function up to any post-Minkowskian order. We specify the discussion to
a stationary optical spacetime describing an occultation by a steady rotating and spherically
symmetric atmosphere. Explicit analytical expressions for the time/frequency transfers are
provided at the first post-Minkowskian order and their accuracy is assessed by comparing them to
results of a numerical integration of the equations for optical rays. Conclusions: The method accurately
describes vertical temperature gradients and properly accounts for light-dragging effect due
to the motion of the optical medium. It can be pushed further in order to derive the explicit form of
the time transfer function at higher order and beyond the spherical symmetry assumption.

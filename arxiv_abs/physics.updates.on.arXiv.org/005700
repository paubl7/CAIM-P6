Cosmic muons have higher energy and are more penetrative compared to induced radiation typically
used for imaging. Due to these properties, cosmic muons can be used for imaging in many industries
such as investigating special nuclear materials for nuclear security. Cosmic muon intensity varies
along the incident angle, and it is known to follow a cosine squared at sea level. Low intensity means
a muon imaging will take a longer time to acquire statistically meaningful counts, for either muon
scattering or absorption tomography, compared to induced radiation systems. So, high energy particle
simulations like GEANT4 are often used to guide measurement studies. However, unlike in the simple
theory, the measurable muon count rate changes upon detector configuration. It is possible to mislead
the experimenter as to actual muon count rates and imaging construction time required for practical
applications. Here we show the effective solid angle model and Monte Carlo method, developed based
on the cosine squared law coupled with detector geometry, estimate the experimental results more
precisely than the simple cosine-squared model. An effective solid angle model must consider the
actual measurable solid angle made by the physical geometry of and their alignment when measuring
the passage of cosmic muons through the system. The solid angle calculated from the detector geometry
is coupled with the cosine squared law and introduced as an effective solid angle. Our results demonstrate
that the new model properly estimates experimental measurements at all zenith angles. Enhanced
estimation at high zenith angles allows us to exploit cosmic muon horizontally for muon tomographic
applications. We anticipate our methods will enhance the ability to estimate actual measurable
cosmic muon count rates in proposed imaging applications by reducing the gap between simulation
and measurement results.

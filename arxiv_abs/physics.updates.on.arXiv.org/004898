In the field of astrophysics, the faint signal from distant galaxies and other dim cosmological
sources at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths require the use of high-sensitivity experiments.
Cryogenics and the use of low-temperature detectors are essential to the accomplishment of the
scientific objectives, allowing lower detector noise levels and improved instrument stability.
Bolometric detectors are usually cooled to temperatures below 1K, and the constraints on the instrument
are stringent, whether the experiment is a space-based platform or a ground-based telescope. The
latter are usually deployed in remote and harsh environments such as the South Pole, where maintenance
needs to be kept minimal. CEA-SBT has acquired a strong heritage in the development of vibration-free
multistage helium-sorption coolers, which can provide cooling down to 200 mK when mounted on a cold
stage at temperatures <5K. In this paper, we focus on the development of a three-stage cooler dedicated
to the BICEP Array project led by Caltech/JPL, which aims to study the birth of the Universe and specifically
the unique B-mode pattern imprinted by primordial gravitational waves on the polarization of the
Cosmic Microwave Background. Several cryogenic receivers are being developed, each featuring
one such helium-sorption cooler operated from a 4K stage cooled by a Cryomech pulse-tube with heat
lifts of >1.35W at 4.2K and >36W at 45K. The major challenge of this project is the large masses to be
cooled to sub-kelvin temperatures (26 kg at 250mK) and the resulting long cool-down time, which
in this novel cooler design is kept to a minimum with the implementation of passive and active thermal
links between different temperature stages. A first unit has been sized to provide 230, 70 and 2{\mu}W
of net heat lifts at the maximum temperatures of 2.8K, 340 and 250mK, respectively, for a minimum
duration of 48 hours.

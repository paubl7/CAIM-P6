Airlines use different boarding policies to organize the queue of passengers waiting to enter the
airplane. We analyze three policies in the many-passenger limit by a geometric representation
of the queue position and row designation of each passenger and apply a Lorentzian metric to calculate
the total boarding time. The boarding time is governed by the time each passenger needs to clear the
aisle, and the added time is determined by the aisle-clearing time distribution through an effective
aisle-clearing time parameter. The non-organized queues under the common random boarding policy
are characterized by large effective aisle-clearing time. We show that, subject to a mathematical
assumption which we have verified by extensive numerical computations in all realistic cases,
the average total boarding time is always reduced when slow passengers are separated from faster
passengers and the slow group is allowed to enter the airplane first. This is a universal result that
holds for any combination of the three main governing parameters: the ratio between effective aisle-clearing
times of the fast and the slow group, the fraction of slow passenger, and the congestion of passengers
in the aisle. Separation into groups based on aisle-clearing time allows for more synchronized
seating, but the result is non-trivial, as the similar fast-first policy -- where the two groups
enter the airplane in reverse order -- is inferior to random boarding for a range of parameter settings.
The asymptotic results conform well with discrete-event simulations with realistic number of
passengers, and both the slow-first and the fast-first policies have the ability to perform unboundedly
better than random boarding. Parameters based on empirical data, with hand luggage as criteria
for separating passengers into the slow group, give a 13\% reduction in total boarding time for slow
first compared to random boarding.

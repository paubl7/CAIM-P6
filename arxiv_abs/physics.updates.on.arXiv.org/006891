We extend the selected columns of the density matrix (SCDM) methodology [J. Chem. Theory Comput.
2015, 11, 1463--1469]---a non-iterative procedure for generating localized occupied orbitals
for condensed-phase systems---to the construction of local molecular orbitals (LMOs) in systems
described using non-orthogonal atomic orbital (AO) basis sets. In particular, we introduce three
different variants of SCDM (referred to as SCDM-M, SCDM-L, and SCDM-G) that can be used in conjunction
with the standard AO basis sets. The SCDM-M and SCDM-L variants are based on the Mulliken and L{\"o}wdin
representations of the density matrix, and are tantamount to selecting a well-conditioned set
of projected atomic orbitals (PAOs) and projected (symmetrically-) orthogonalized atomic orbitals
(POAOs), respectively, as proto-LMOs. The SCDM-G variant leverages a real-space (grid) representation
of the wavefunction to select a set of well-conditioned proto-LMOs. A detailed comparative analysis
reveals that the LMOs generated by these three SCDM variants are robust, comparable in orbital locality
to those produced with the iterative Boys or Pipek-Mezey (PM) localization schemes, and are agnostic
towards any single orbital locality metric. Although all three SCDM variants are based on the density
matrix, we find that the character of the generated LMOs can differ significantly between SCDM-M,
SCDM-L, and SCDM-G. In this regard, only the grid-based SCDM-G procedure (like PM) generates LMOs
that qualitatively preserve $\sigma\text{-}\pi$ symmetry and are well-aligned with chemical
intuition. While the direct and standalone use of SCDM-generated LMOs should suffice for most applications,
our findings also suggest that the use of these orbitals as an unbiased and cost-effective (initial)
guess also has the potential to improve the convergence of iterative orbital localization schemes.

Invasive species harm biodiversity and ecosystem services, with global economic costs of invasions
exceeding $40 billion annually. Widespread invasions are a particular challenge because they
involve large spatial scales with many interacting components. In these contexts, typical optimization-based
approaches to management may fail due to computational or data constraints. Here we evaluate an
alternative solution that leverages network science, representing the invasion as occurring
across a network of connected sites and using network metrics to prioritize sites for intervention.
Such heuristic network-guided methods require less data and are less computationally intensive
than optimization methods, yet network-guided approaches have not been bench-marked against
optimal solutions for real-world invasive species management problems. We provide the first comparison
of the performance of network-guided management relative to optimal solutions for invasive species,
examining the placement of watercraft inspection stations for preventing spread of invasive zebra
mussels through recreational boat movement within 58 Minnesota counties in the United States.
To additionally test the promise of network-based approaches in limited data contexts, we evaluate
their performance when using only partial data on network structure and invaded status. Metric-based
approaches can achieve a median of 100% of optimal performance with full data. Even with partial
data, 80% of optimal performance is achievable. Finally, we show that performance of metric-guided
management improves for counties with denser and larger networks, suggesting this approach is
viable for large-scale invasions. Together, our results suggest network metrics are a promising
approach to guiding management actions for large-scale invasions.

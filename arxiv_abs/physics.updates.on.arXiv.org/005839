Feynman's multifaceted contributions to gravitation, as can be inferred from several published
and unpublished sources, are here reviewed. Feynman thought about this subject at least from late
1954 to the late '60s, giving several contributions to it. Even if he only published three papers
on gravity, much more material is available, especially the records of his many interventions at
the Chapel Hill conference in 1957, which are here analyzed in detail. There, Feynman showed that
he had already developed much of his picture of gravity, and he expressed deep thoughts about fundamental
issues in quantum mechanics, such as superpositions of the wave functions of macroscopic objects
and the role of the observer, which were suggested by the problem of quantum gravity. Moreover, Feynman
lectured on gravity several times. Besides the famous lectures given at Caltech in 1962-63, he extensively
discussed this subject in a series of lectures given at the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1966-67, whose
focus was astronomy and astrophysics. Here Feynman gave a somewhat simplified exposition with
respect to the Caltech lectures, but with many original points. All this material allows to reconstruct
a detailed picture of Feynman's ideas on gravity and of its evolution until the late sixties. The
main points are that gravity, like electromagnetism, has a quantum foundation, so that classical
general relativity has to be regarded as emerging from an underlying quantum theory, and that this
quantum theory has to be investigated by computing physical processes, as if they were measurable.
The same attitude is shown with respect to gravitational waves, as evident both from the Chapel Hill
records and a letter written to V. Weisskopf. As a bonus, an original approach to gravity, which closely
mimics the derivation of the Maxwell equations he gave in that period, is hinted at in the unpublished
lectures.

Coil complexity is a critical consideration in stellarator design. The traditional two-step optimization
approach, in which the plasma boundary is optimized for physics properties and the coils are subsequently
optimized to be consistent with this boundary, can result in plasma shapes which cannot be produced
with sufficiently simple coils. To address this challenge, we propose a method to incorporate considerations
of coil complexity in the optimization of the plasma boundary. Coil complexity metrics are computed
from the current potential solution obtained with the REGCOIL code (Landreman 2017 Nucl. Fusion
57 046003). We compute the local sensitivity of these metrics with respect to perturbations of the
plasma boundary using the shape gradient (Landreman & Paul 2018 Nucl. Fusion 58 076023). We extend
REGCOIL to compute derivatives of these metrics with respect to parameters describing the plasma
boundary. In keeping with previous research on winding surface optimization (Paul et al. 2018 Nucl.
Fusion 58 076015), the shape derivatives are computed with a discrete adjoint method. In contrast
with the previous work, derivatives are computed with respect to the plasma rather than the winding
surface parameters. To further reduce the required resolution, we present a more efficient representation
of the plasma surface using a single Fourier series to describe the radial distance from a coordinate
axis and a spectrally condensed poloidal angle. This representation is advantageous over the standard
cylindrical representation used in the VMEC code (Hirshman & Whitson 1983 The Physics of Fluids
26 3553-3568), as it provides a uniquely defined poloidal angle, eliminating a null space in the
optimization of the plasma surface. The resulting shape gradient highlights features of the plasma
boundary consistent with simple coils and can be used to couple coil and fixed-boundary optimization.

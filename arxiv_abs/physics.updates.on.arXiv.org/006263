Energy landscapes exemplify the predictive power of physics. Energy(-like) landscapes can explain
biological processes, including some aspects of protein folding and gene expression. But for the
most part, we cannot apply the familiar physics frameworks to predict behaviors of living systems.
Instead, one predominantly models living systems with differential equations that are tailored
to each system. Unfortunately, this approach faces the "parameter problem": just a few biological
processes can involve countless types of nonlinear, mathematical functions and unknown parameter
values. As a complementary approach, one can view living systems as discrete dynamical systems
governed by binary variables. Often, binary statements are accurate first-order approximations
to biological features. Cellular automata are ideal for modeling discrete dynamics by incorporating
such digital, verbal statements. While quantitative (Hamiltonian-based) rules can dictate cellular
automata (e.g., Cellular Potts Model), numerous features of cells are more naturally summarized
verbally than quantitatively (e.g., gene is (highly) expressed or not (highly) expressed). Cellular
automata with verbal rules are underexplored in biology. They are usually difficult to understand
because they produce complex, multi-agent dynamics that are - by design - difficult to quantify
and because much of the mathematical tools (e.g., calculus) apply to continuous but not discrete
dynamics. Promisingly, recent studies revealed that there can be unconventional, predictive
landscapes - based on Lyapunov functions - that give an "equation of motion" that reveals all possible
dynamics of a biologically motivated cellular automaton. Here we review these studies and predictive
landscapes in general. Investigating biologically motivated cellular automata may reveal new
links between living systems and theories of computation.

Various biological processes such as transport of oxygen and nutrients, thrombus formation, vascular
angiogenesis and remodeling are related to cellular/subcellular level biological processes,
where mesoscopic simulations resolving detailed cell dynamics provide a key to understanding
and identifying the cellular basis of disease. To break this bottleneck and achieve a biologically
meaningful timescale, we propose a multiscale parareal algorithm in which a continuum-based solver
supervises a mesoscopic simulation in the time-domain. Using an iterative prediction-correction
strategy, the parallel-in-time mesoscopic simulation supervised by its continuum-based counterpart
can converge fast. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first verified in a time-dependent
flow with a sinusoidal flowrate through a Y-shaped bifurcation channel. Physical quantities of
interest including velocity, wall shear stress and flowrate are computed to compare against those
of reference solutions, showing a less than 1% relative error on flowrate in the Newtonian flow and
a less than 3\% relative error in the non-Newtonian blood flow. The proposed method is then applied
to a large-scale mesoscopic simulation of microvessel blood flow in a zebrafish hindbrain for temporal
acceleration. The time-dependent blood flow from heartbeats in this realistic vascular network
of zebrafish hindbrain is simulated using dissipative particle dynamics as the mesoscopic model,
which is supervised by a one-dimensional blood flow model (continuum-based model) in multiple
temporal sub-domains. The computational analysis shows that the resulting microvessel blood
flow converges to the reference solution after only two iterations. The proposed method is suitable
for long-time mesoscopic simulations with complex fluids and geometries.

During the Corona crisis measures were taken to avoid the spread of the virus, and one of the most important
was to 'keep sufficient distance'. In this period cyclists were facilitated in distancing by the
widening of cycle paths, or the use of car lanes. The Corona measures also affected intersection
control, since one of the principles of signalizing is based on clustering of traffic. The settings
of the control take into account the way cyclists tend to cluster close together at the stop line,
so for optimal control, if the clustering changes, the control should be adapted as well. This paper
presents measures for 'Corona-safe' intersection control for cyclists, and discusses the effect
of the measures and their (dis)advantages. Further it was investigated how some municipalities
used these measures and conveyed about it in the media and how these measures were received by the
public. The measures can be divided in two groups: detection and timing. For the municipalities
considered, the least popular measures concerned the detection methods, such as adaptations in
use, or type, of push button, since the negative aspects can be large (effect on throughput and costs).
More popular were changes in the timing of the control, the most conveyed measures being more frequent
and longer green for cyclists. The acceptance of the measures by the public (determined via reactions
on social media) is mixed, some are positive about the improved control, others negative (effect
on car traffic or costs). The most common reactions are general complaints about intersection control,
and about cyclists behaviour. For future use the measure 'more frequent green' is most suitable,
permitted cyclists are detected to support the acceptance of the control. Also bicycle apps can
be applied, since these results in more comfort and have limited negative effects.

Microorganisms navigate through fluid, often confined by complex environments, to survive and
sustain life. Inspired by this fact, we consider a model system and seek to understand the wall curvature
driven dynamics of a squirmer, a mathematical model for a microswimmer, using (i) lattice Boltzmann
simulations and (ii) analytical theory by \citet{dario_gareth}. The instantaneous dynamics
of the system is presented in terms of fluid velocity fields, and the translational and angular velocities
of the microswimmer, whereas the long time dynamics is presented by plotting the squirmer trajectories
near curved boundaries in physical and dynamical space, as well as characterising them in terms
of (i) proximity parameter, (ii) retention time, (iii) swimmer orientation and (iv) tangential
velocity near the boundary, and (v) scattering angle during the collision. Our detailed analysis
shows that irrespective of the type and strength, microswimmers exhibit a greater affinity towards
a concave boundary due to hydrodynamic interactions compared to a convex boundary. In the presence
of additional repulsive interactions with the boundary, we find that pullers (propel by forward
thrust) have a slightly greater affinity towards the convex--curved walls compared to pushers
(propel by backward thrust). Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the consequence
of hydrodynamic interactions in a unified framework that encompasses the dynamics of pullers,
pushers, and neutral swimmers in the neighbourhood of flat, concave, and convex walls. In addition,
the combined effect of oppositely curved surfaces is studied by confining the squirmer in an annulus.
The results presented in a unified framework and insights obtained are expected to be useful to design
geometrical confinements to control and guide the motion of microswimmers in microfluidic applications.

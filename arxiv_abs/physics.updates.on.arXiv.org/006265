Gauge fields lie at the heart of the fundamental physics of our universe and condensed matter. In
lattice systems, the manipulation of local gauge flux, though crucial for quantum states control
and for the probe of exotic quantum phases, however, has never reached the sub-unit-cell scale.
Here, we report on the first experimental realization of local gauge flux insertion in a single plaquette
in a lattice with the gauge phase embracing the full range from 0 to $2\pi$. This extremely localized
gauge flux is achieved through an approach based on dimension extension, a step screw dislocation
and dimensional reduction. Remarkably, we discover that such single-plaquette gauge flux insertion
leads to the detection of the real-space topological invariants (RSTIs) which are instrumental
in discerning various topological phases in two-dimensional lattices. The salient consequence
of the RSTIs is the spectral flows across the topological band gaps, which are manifested as the emergent
topological boundary states localized around and propagating along the inserted gauge flux. We
create the physical realization of such a scenario using a designed sonic crystal structure and
verify the topological boundary states by detecting their dispersions and wavefunctions through
versatile acoustic measurements. We further visualize in experiments the gauge phase accumulation
around the flux-carrying plaquette and the one-dimensional propagation of the topological boundary
states. Our work unveils experimentally an unprecedented regime for gauge fields in lattices and
a fundamental topological response in topological crystalline phases, which thus brings about
new aspects in the study of synthetic gauge fields and topological physics.

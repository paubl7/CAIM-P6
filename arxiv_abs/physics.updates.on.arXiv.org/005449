Terrestrial extrasolar planets around low-mass stars are prime targets when searching for atmospheric
biosignatures with current and near-future telescopes. The habitable-zone Super-Earth LHS 1140
b could hold a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere and is an excellent candidate for detecting atmospheric
features. In this study, we investigate how the instellation and planetary parameters influence
the atmospheric climate, chemistry, and spectral appearance of LHS 1140 b. We study the detectability
of selected molecules, in particular potential biosignatures, with the upcoming James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) and Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). In a first step we use the coupled climate-chemistry
model, 1D-TERRA, to simulate a range of assumed atmospheric chemical compositions dominated by
H$_2$ and CO$_2$. Further, we vary the concentrations of CH$_4$ by several orders of magnitude.
In a second step we calculate transmission spectra of the simulated atmospheres and compare them
to recent transit observations. Finally, we determine the observation time required to detect
spectral bands with low resolution spectroscopy using JWST and the cross-correlation technique
using ELT. In H$_2$-dominated and CH$_4$-rich atmospheres O$_2$ has strong chemical sinks, leading
to low concentrations of O$_2$ and O$_3$. The potential biosignatures NH$_3$, PH$_3$, CH$_3$Cl
and N$_2$O are less sensitive to the concentration of H$_2$, CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ in the atmosphere.
In the simulated H$_2$-dominated atmosphere the detection of these gases might be feasible within
20 to 100 observation hours with ELT or JWST, when assuming weak extinction by hazes. If further observations
of LHS 1140 b suggest a thin, clear, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, the planet would be one of the
best known targets to detect biosignature gases in the atmosphere of a habitable-zone rocky exoplanet
with upcoming telescopes.

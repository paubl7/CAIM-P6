We consider the influence of transverse confinement on the instability properties of velocity
and density distributions reminiscent of those pertaining to exchange flows in stratified inclined
ducts, such as the recent experiment of Lefauve et al. (J. Fluid Mech. 848, 508-544, 2018). Using
a normal mode streamwise and temporal expansion for flows in ducts with various aspect ratios $B$
and non-trivial transverse velocity profiles, we calculate two-dimensional (2D) dispersion
relations with associated eigenfunctions varying in the 'crosswise' direction, in which the density
varies, and the spanwise direction, both normal to the duct walls and to the flow direction. We also
compare these 2D dispersion relations to the so-called one-dimensional (1D) dispersion relation
obtained for spanwise invariant perturbations, for different aspect ratios $B$ and bulk Richardson
numbers $Ri_b$. In this limited parameter space, the presence of lateral walls has a stabilizing
effect. Furthermore, accounting for spanwise-varying perturbations results in a plethora of
unstable modes, the number of which increases as the aspect ratio is increased. These modes present
an odd-even regularity in their spatial structures, which is rationalized by comparison to the
so-called one-dimensional oblique (1D-O) dispersion relation obtained for oblique waves. Finally,
we show that in most cases, the most unstable 2D mode is the one that oscillates the least in the spanwise
direction, as a consequence of viscous damping. However, in a limited region of the parameter space
and in the absence of stratification, we show that a secondary mode with a more complex `twisted'
structure dominated by crosswise vorticity becomes more unstable than the least oscillating Kelvin-Helmholtz
mode associated with spanwise vorticity.

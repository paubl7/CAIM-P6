The rapid emergence and the disastrous impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on public health, societies, and economies around the world has created
an urgent need for understanding the pathways critical for virus transmission. Airborne virus
transmission by asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals is considered to be a major contributor
to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and social distancing and wearing of face masks in public have been implemented
as countermeasures in many countries. However, a comprehensive risk assessment framework for
the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 incorporating realistic assumptions on the filtration
of infectious aerosols (IAs) by face masks is not available yet. In particular, in most end-to-end
models for airborne virus transmission, it is neglected that the stochastic spread of IAs through
imperfectly fitted face masks depends on the dynamics of the breathing of the wearer. In this paper,
we consider airborne virus transmission from an infected but asymptomatic person to a healthy person,
both wearing imperfectly fitted face masks, in an indoor environment. By framing the end-to-end
virus transmission as a Molecular Communications (MC) system, we obtain a statistical description
of the number of IAs inhaled by the healthy person subject to the respective configurations of the
face masks of both persons. We demonstrate that the exhalation and inhalation air flow dynamics
have a significant impact on the stochastic filtering of IAs by the face masks. Furthermore, we show
that the fit of the face mask of the infected person can highly impact the infection probability.
We conclude that the proposed MC model may contribute a valuable assessment tool to fight the spread
of SARS-CoV-2 as it encompasses the randomness of the transmission process and enables comprehensive
risk analysis beyond statistical averages.

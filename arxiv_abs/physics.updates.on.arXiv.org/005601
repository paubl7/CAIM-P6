We propose a realistic model for the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic subject to the lockdown and
quarantine measures, which takes into account the time-delay for recovery or death processes.
The dynamic equations for the entire process are derived by adopting a kinetic-type reaction approach.
More specifically, the lockdown and the quarantine measures are modelled by some kind of inhibitor
reactions where susceptible and infected individuals can be trapped into inactive states. The
dynamics for the recovered people is obtained by accounting people who are only traced back to hospitalised
infected people. To get the evolution equation we take inspiration from the Michaelis- Menten enzyme-substrate
reaction model (the so-called MM reaction) where the enzyme is associated to the available hospital
beds, the substrate to the infected people, and the product to the recovered people, respectively.
In other words, everything happens as if the hospitals beds act as a catalyser in the hospital recovery
process. Of course, in our case the reverse MM reactions has no sense in our case and, consequently,
the kinetic constant is equal to zero. Finally, the O.D.E.s for people tested positive to COVID-19
is simply modelled by the following kinetic scheme S+I=>2I with I=>R or I=>D, with S, I, R, and D denoting
the compartments Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased people, respectively. The resulting
kinetic-type equation} provide the O.D.E.s, for elementary reaction steps, describing the number
of the infected people, the total number of the recovered people previously hospitalised, subject
to the lockdown and the quarantine measure, and the total number of deaths. The model foresees also
the second wave of Infection by Coronavirus. The tests carried out on real data for Belgium, France
and Germany confirmed the correctness of our model.

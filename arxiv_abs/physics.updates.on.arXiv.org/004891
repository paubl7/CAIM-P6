Velocity gradient is the basis of many vortex recognition methods, such as Q criterion, $\Delta$
criterion, $\lambda_{2}$ criterion, $\lambda_{ci}$ criterion and $\Omega$ criterion, etc..
Except the $\lambda_{ci}$ criterion, all these criterions recognize vortices by designing various
invariants, based on the Helmholtz decomposition that decomposes velocity gradient into strain
rate and spin. In recent years, the intuition of 'no vortex in straight flows' has promoted people
to analyze the vortex state directly from the velocity gradient, in which vortex can be distinguished
from the situation that the velocity gradient has couple complex eigenvalues. A specious viewpoint
to adopt the simple shear as an independent flow mode was emphasized by many authors, among them,
Kolar proposed the triple decomposition of motion by extracting a so-called effective pure shearing
motion; Li et al. introduced the so-called quaternion decomposition of velocity gradient and proposed
the concept of eigen rotation; Liu et al. further mined the characteristic information of velocity
gradient and put forward an effective algorithm of Liutex, and then developed the vortex recognition
method. However, there is another explanation for the increasingly clear representation of velocity
gradient, that is the local streamline pattern based on critical-point theory. In this paper, the
tensorial expressions of the right/left real Schur forms of velocity gradient are clarified from
the characteristic problem of velocity gradient. The relations between the involved parameters
are derived and numerically verified. Comparing with the geometrical features of local streamline
pattern, we confirm that the parameters in the right eigen-representation based on the right real
Schur form of velocity gradient have good meanings to reveal the local streamline pattern. Some
illustrative examples from the DNS data are presented.

Energy equipartition is appropriate only for nonrelativistic classical mechanics, but has only
limited relevance for a relativistic theory such as classical electrodynamics. In this article,
we discuss harmonic-oscillator thermal equilibrium from three different perspectives. First,
we contrast the thermal equilibrium of nonrelativistic mechanical oscillators (where point collisions
are allowed and frequency is irrelevant) with the equilibrium of relativistic radiation modes
(where frequency is crucial). The Rayleigh-Jeans law appears from applying a dipole-radiation
approximation to impose the nonrelativistic mechanical equilibrium on the radiation spectrum.
In this discussion, we note the possibility of zero-point energy for relativistic radiation, which
possibility does not arise for nonrelativistic classical-mechanical systems. Second, we turn
to a simple electromagnetic model of a harmonic oscillator and show that the oscillator is fully
in radiation equilibrium (which involves all radiation multipoles, dipole, quadrupole, etc.)
with classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation, but is not in equilibrium with the Rayleigh-Jeans
spectrum. Finally, we discuss the contrast between the flexibility of nonrelativistic mechanics
with its arbitrary potential functions allowing separate scalings for length, time, and energy,
with the sharply-controlled behavior of relativistic classical electrodynamics with its single
scaling connecting together the scales for length, time, and energy. It is emphasized that within
classical physics, energy-sharing, velocity-dependent damping is associated with the low-frequency,
nonrelativistic part of the Planck thermal radiation spectrum, whereas acceleration-dependent
radiation damping is associated with the high-frequency adiabatically-invariant and Lorentz-invariant
part of the spectrum corresponding to zero-point radiation.

The research is aimed at developing the recommendations for educators on using adaptive technologies
and augmented reality in personalized learning implementation. The latest educational technologies
related to learning personalization and the adaptation of its content to the individual needs of
students and group work are considered. The current state of research is described, the trends of
development are determined. Due to a detailed analysis of scientific works, a retrospective of
the development of adaptive and, in particular, cloud-oriented systems is shown. The preconditions
of their appearance and development, the main scientific ideas that contributed to this are analyzed.
The analysis showed that the scientists point to four possible types of semantic interaction of
augmented reality and adaptive technologies. The adaptive cloud-based educational systems design
is considered as the promising trend of research. It was determined that adaptability can be manifested
in one or a combination of several aspects: content, evaluation and consistency. The cloud technology
is taken as a platform for integrating adaptive learning with augmented reality as the effective
modern tools to personalize learning. The prospects of the adaptive cloud-based systems design
in the context of teachers training are evaluated. The essence and place of assistive technologies
in adaptive learning systems design are defined. It is shown that augmented reality can be successfully
applied in inclusive education. The ways of combining adaptive systems and augmented reality tools
to support the process of teachers training are considered. The recommendations on the use of adaptive
cloud-based systems in teacher education are given.

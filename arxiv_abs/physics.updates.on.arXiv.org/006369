Spectral analyses of energetic particle (EP) driven bursts of MHD fluctuations in magnetically
confined plasmas often exhibit multiple simultaneous chirps. While the superposition of oscillations
at multiple frequencies necessarily causes beating in the signal acquired by a localized external
probe, self-consistent hybrid simulations of chirping EP modes in a JT-60U tokamak plasma have
demonstrated the possibility of global beating, where the electromagnetic field vanishes globally
between beats and reappears with opposite phase. This implies that there can be a single field mode
that oscillates at multiple frequencies simultaneously when resonantly driven by multiple density
waves in EP phase space. Conversely, this means that the EP density waves are mutually coupled and
interfere with each other via the jointly driven field, a mechanism ignored in some theories. In
this treatise, we study the role of field pulsations in general and beating in particular using the
Hamiltonian guiding center orbit-following code ORBIT with a reduced wave-particle interaction
model in realistic geometry. Through amplitude pulsations and phase jumps, beating is found to
drive the evolution of EP phase space structures. Observations: (1) Beating causes density wave
fronts to advance radially in pulses. The resulting chirps become staircase-like. (2) The beats
facilitate convective transfer of material between neighboring layers of phase space density
waves. On the one hand, this may delay detachment of solitary vortices. On the other hand, it facilitates
the accumulation of hole and clump fragments into larger structures. (3) Long-range chirping occurs
when massive holes or clumps detach and drift away from the turbulent belt around the seed resonance.
The detached vortices can remain robust and, on average, maintain their concentric nested layers
while being perturbed by the field's continued beating.

Accurate measurement of the local component of geodetic motion at GPS stations presents a challenge
due to the need to separate this signal from the tectonic plate rotation. A pressing example is the
observation of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) which constrains the Earth's response to ice
unloading, and hence, contributions of ice-covered regions such as Antarctica to global sea level
rise following ice mass loss. We focus on horizontal GPS velocities which typically contain a large
component of plate rotation and a smaller local component primarily relating to GIA. Incomplete
separation of these components introduces significant bias into estimates of GIA motion vectors.
We present the results of a series of tests based on the motions of GPS stations from East Antarctica:
1) signal separation for sets of synthetic data that replicate the geometric character of non-separable,
and separable, GIA-like horizontal velocities; and 2) signal separation for real GPS station data
with an appraisal of uncertainties. For both synthetic and real motions, we compare results where
the stations are unweighted, and where each station is areal-weighted using a metric representing
the inverse of the spatial density of neighbouring stations. From the synthetic tests, we show that
a GIA-like signal is recoverable from the plate rotation signal providing it has geometric variability
across East Antarctica. We also show that areal-weighting has a very significant effect on the ability
to recover a GIA-like signal with geometric variability, and hence on separating the plate rotation
and local components. For the real data, assuming a rigid Antarctic plate, fitted plate rotation
parameters compare well with other studies in the literature. We find that 25 out of 36 GPS stations
examined in East Antarctica have non-zero local horizontal velocities, at the 2$\sigma$ level,
after signal separation.

The tracking of symmetry-breaking events in space is a longlasting goal of astrochemists, aiming
at an understanding of homochiral Earth chemistry. One current effort at this frontier aims at the
detection of small chiral molecules in the interstellar medium. For that, high-resolution laboratory
spectroscopy data is required, providing blueprints for the search and assignment of these molecules
using radioastronomy. Here, we used chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave and millimeter-wave
spectroscopy and frequency modulation absorption spectroscopy to record and assign the rotational
spectrum of the chiral aromatic molecule styrene oxide, $\mathrm{C_{6}H_{5}C_{2}H_{3}O}$,
a relevant candidate for future radioastronomy searches. Using experimental data from the 2-12,
75-110, 170-220, and 260-330 GHz regions, we performed a global spectral analysis, complemented
by quantum chemistry calculations. A global fit of the ground state rotational spectrum was obtained,
including rotational transitions from all four frequency regions. Primary rotational constants
as well as quartic and sextic centrifugal distortion constants were determined. We also investigated
vibrationally excited states of styrene oxide, and for the three lowest vibrational states, we
determined rotational constants including centrifugal distortion corrections up to the sextic
order. In addition, spectroscopic parameters for the singly-substituted $^{13}$C and $^{18}$O
isotopologues were retrieved from the spectrum in natural abundance and used to determine the effective
ground state structure of styrene oxide in the gas phase. The spectroscopic parameters and line
lists of rotational transitions obtained here will assist future astrochemical studies of this
class of chiral organic molecules.

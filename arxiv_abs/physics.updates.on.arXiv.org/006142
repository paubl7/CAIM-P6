Background: Gene regulatory networks coordinate the expression of genes across physiological
states and ensure a synchronized expression of genes in cellular subsystems, critical for the coherent
functioning of cells. Here we address the questions whether it is possible to predict gene synchronization
from network structure alone. We have recently shown that synchronized gene expression may be predicted
from symmetries in the gene regulatory networks (GRN) and described by the concept of symmetry fibrations.
We showed that symmetry fibrations partition the genes into groups called fibers based on the symmetries
of their 'input trees', the set of paths in the network through which signals can reach a gene. In idealized
dynamic gene expression models, all genes in a fiber are perfectly synchronized, while less idealized
models - with gene input functions differencing between genes - predict symmetry breaking and desynchronization.
Results: To study the functional role of gene fibers and to test whether some of the fiber-induced
coexpression remains in reality, we analyze gene fibrations for the gene regulatory networks of
E. coli and B. subtilis and confront them with expression data. We find approximate gene coexpression
patterns consistent with symmetry fibrations with idealized gene expression dynamics. This shows
that network structure alone provides useful information about gene synchronization, and suggest
that gene input functions within fibers may be further streamlined by evolutionary pressures to
realize a coexpression of genes. Conclusions: Thus, gene fibrations provides a sound conceptual
tool to describe tunable coexpression induced by network topology and shaped by mechanistic details
of gene expression.

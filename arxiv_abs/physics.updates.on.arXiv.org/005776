The ambitious energy target to achieve climate-neutrality in the European Union (EU) energy system
raises the question of the feasibility of using only renewables across all energy sectors. As one
of the leading industrialized countries of the EU, Germany has adopted several climate action plans
for the realistic implementation and maximum utilization of renewable energies in its future energy
system. The literature review shows a clear gap in comprehensive techniques describing an open
modeling approach for analyzing fully renewable and sector-coupled energy systems. This paper
outlines an open modeling technique for analyzing the 100% renewable-based and sector-coupled
energy system's feasibility in Germany. It identifies the capacities and investment costs for
different components and briefly evaluates the system's flexibility aspects in terms of transmission
grid expansion, energy storage, and dispatchable loads. Based on the open energy modeling framework
(Oemof), an hourly optimization tool 'OSeEM-DE' is developed to investigate the German energy
system. The model results show that a 100% renewable-based and sector-coupled system for electricity
and building heat is feasible in Germany under different conditions. The investment capacities
and component costs depend on the parametric variations of the developed scenarios. According
to the model results, the annual investment costs vary between 17.6 - 26.6 bn Euro/yr for the volatile
generators and between 23.7 - 28.8 bn Euro/yr for the heat generators. The model also suggests an
investment of a minimum of 2.7 - 3.9 bn Euro/yr for electricity and heat storage. Comparing the OSeEM-DE
results with Fraunhofer ISE study reports shows that the percentage-wise energy mix composition
and the Levelized Cost of Electricity from the model are within the plausible ranges.

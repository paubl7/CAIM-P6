Molecular aggregates can under certain conditions transport electronic excitation energy over
large distances due to dipole-dipole interactions. Here, we explore to what extent thermal motion
of entire monomers can guide or enhance this excitation transport. The motion induces changes of
aggregate geometry and hence modifies exciton states. Under certain conditions, excitation energy
can thus be transported by the aggregate adiabatically, following a certain exciton eigenstate.
While such transport is always slower than direct migration through dipole-dipole interactions,
we show that transport through motion can yield higher transport efficiencies in the presence of
on-site energy disorder than the static counterpart. For this we consider two simple models of molecular
motion: (i) longitudinal vibrations of the monomers along the aggregation direction within their
inter-molecular binding potential and (ii) torsional motion of planar monomers in a plane orthogonal
to the aggregation direction. The parameters and potential shapes used are relevant to dye-molecule
aggregates. We employ a quantum-classical method, in which molecules move through simplified
classical molecular dynamics, while the excitation transport is treated quantum mechanically
using Schr\"odinger's equation. For both models we find parameter regimes in which the motion enhances
excitation transport, however these are more realistic for the torsional scenario, due to the limited
motional range in a typical Morse type inter-molecular potential. We finally show that the transport
enhancement can be linked to adiabatic quantum dynamics. This transport enhancement through adiabatic
motion appears a useful resource to combat exciton trapping by disorder.

The dense social contact networks and high mobility in congested urban areas facilitate the rapid
transmission of infectious diseases. Typical mechanistic epidemiological models are either
based on uniform mixing with ad-hoc contact processes or need real-time or archived population
mobility data to simulate the social networks. However, the rapid and global transmission of the
novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has led to unprecedented lockdowns at global and regional scales,
leaving the archived datasets to limited use. While it is often hypothesized that population density
is a significant driver in disease propagation, the disparate disease trajectories and infection
rates exhibited by the different cities with comparable densities require a high-resolution description
of the disease and its drivers. In this study, we explore the impact of the creation of containment
zones on travel patterns within the city. Further, we use a dynamical network-based infectious
disease model to understand the key drivers of disease spread at sub-kilometer scales demonstrated
in the city of Ahmedabad, India, which has been classified as a SARS-CoV-2 hotspot. We find that in
addition to the contact network and population density, road connectivity patterns and ease of
transit are strongly correlated with the rate of transmission of the disease. Given the limited
access to real-time traffic data during lockdowns, we generate road connectivity networks using
open-source imageries and travel patterns from open-source surveys and government reports. Within
the proposed framework, we then analyze the relative merits of social distancing, enforced lockdowns,
and enhanced testing and quarantining mitigating the disease spread.

Much of the research on networks using patent data focuses on citations and the collaboration networks
of inventors, hence regarding patents as a positive sign of invention. However, patenting is, most
importantly, a strategic action used by companies to compete with each other. This study sheds light
on inter-organisational adversarial relationships in patenting for the first time. We constructed
and analysed the network of companies connected via patent opposition relationships that occurred
between 1980 and 2018. A majority of the companies are directly or indirectly connected to each other
and hence form the largest connected component. We found that in the network, many companies disapprove
patents in various industrial sectors as well as those owned by foreign companies. The network exhibits
heavy-tailed, power-law-like degree distribution and assortative mixing, making it an unusual
type of topology. We further investigated the dynamics of the formation of this network by conducting
a temporal network motif analysis, with patent co-ownership among the companies considered. By
regarding opposition as a negative relationship and patent co-ownership as a positive relationship,
we analysed where collaboration may occur in the opposition network and how such positive relationships
would interact with negative relationships. The results identified the structurally imbalanced
triadic motifs and the temporal patterns of the occurrence of triads formed by a mixture of positive
and negative relationships. Our findings suggest that the mechanisms of the emergence of the inter-organisational
adversarial relationships may differ from those of other types of negative relationships hence
necessitating further research.

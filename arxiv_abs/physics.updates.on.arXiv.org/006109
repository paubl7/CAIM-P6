When a volatile drop impacts on a superheated solid, air drainage and vapor generation conspire
to create an intermediate gas layer that delays or even prevents contact between the liquid and the
solid. In this article, we use high-speed synchronized reflection interference and total internal
reflection imaging to measure the short-time dynamics of the intermediate gas film and to probe
the transition between levitation and contact. We observe that the substrate temperature strongly
affects the vertical position of the liquid-gas interface and that the dynamic Leidenfrost transition
is influenced by both air and vapor drainage (\emph{i.e}, gas drainage), and evaporation, the later
giving rise to hitherto unreported vertical oscillations of the gas film that can trigger liquid-solid
contact. We first derive scaling relations for the height of the gas film trapped under the drop's
centerline, called the dimple height, and the minimum film thickness at short times. The former
is set by a competition between gas drainage and liquid inertia, similarly as for isothermal impacts,
while the later strongly depends on the vapor production. The gas pressure, at the location where
the minimum thickness is reached, is determined by liquid inertia and vapor production and ultimately
balanced by the increasing interfacial curvature, determining the minimum thickness. We show
that, in the low impact velocity limit, the transient stability of the draining gas film remarkably
makes dynamic levitation less demanding than static levitation. We characterise the vertical
gas film oscillations by measuring their frequency and monitoring their occurrence in the parameter
space spanned by surface temperature and impact velocity. Finally, we model the occurrence of these
oscillations and account for their frequency through an hydrodynamic mechanism.

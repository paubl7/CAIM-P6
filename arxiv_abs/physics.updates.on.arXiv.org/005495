The use of Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Neural Networks (NN) to discriminate
between modern human individuals using elemental fingerprints recorded from bone fragments has
potential as an archaeological application in the future. Improvements in sample selection and
excavation would aid in distinguishing distinct individuals in disarticulated or commingled
human skeletal assemblages based on the NN analysis of LIBS spectra from bone remains. Here we evaluate
this method using open-access NN software to classify archaeological bones of individuals from
the 17th to the 19th century. We critically assess the influence of soil contaminants, by separating
the elemental fingerprint into two groups of different components prior to the NN analysis. The
first group includes elements related to the inorganic chemical composition of the bones (Ca and
P) as well as elements that are regularly deposited in the living bone tissues (Mg, Na, Sr, and Ba).
The second group includes metals with a low probability to be accumulated in living bone tissues
and whose presence is instead more likely to be related to diagenesis and the chemical composition
of the soil (Al, Fe, Mn). Generally, the NN analysis provided accurate results, indicating that
it is a promising tool for LIBS applications in osteoarchaeology. The influence of bone diagenesis
and soil contaminants is significant. False classifications occurred exclusively in the NN analyses
that relied partially on elemental peaks from this second group of elements. Overall, our study
indicates that the discrimination between individuals through LIBS and NN analysis of bone material
in an archaeological setting is possible, but a targeted approach based on selected elements is
required and the influence of bone diagenesis will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

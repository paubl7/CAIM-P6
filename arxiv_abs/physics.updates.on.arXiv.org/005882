Cross-flow, or vertical-axis, turbines are a promising technology for capturing kinetic energy
in wind or flowing water and their inherently unsteady fluid mechanics present unique opportunities
for control optimization of individual rotors or arrays. To explore the potential for beneficial
interactions between turbines in an array, coherent structures in the wake of a single two-bladed
cross-flow turbine are examined using planar stereo particle image velocimetry in a water channel.
First, the mean wake structure of this high chord-to-radius ratio rotor is described, compared
to previous studies, and a simple explanation for observed wake deflection is presented. Second,
the unsteady flow is then analyzed via the triple decomposition, with the periodic component extracted
using a combination of traditional techniques and a novel implementation of the optimized dynamic
mode decomposition. The latter method is shown to outperform conditional averaging and Fourier
methods, as well as uncover frequencies suggesting a transition to bluff-body shedding in the far
wake. Third, vorticity and finite-time Lyapunov exponents are then employed to further analyze
the oscillatory wake component. Vortex streets on both sides of the wake are identified, and their
formation mechanisms and effects on the mean flow are discussed. Strong axial (vertical) flow is
observed in vortical structures shed on the retreating side of the rotor where the blades travel
downstream. Time-resolved tracking of these vortices is performed, which demonstrates that vortex
trajectories have significant rotation-to-rotation variation within one diameter downstream.
This variability suggests it would be challenging to harness or avoid such structures at greater
downstream distances.

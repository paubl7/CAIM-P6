The many-body expansion (MBE) of energies of molecular clusters or solids offers a way to detect
and analyze errors of theoretical methods that could go unnoticed if only the total energy of the
system was considered. In this regard, the interaction between the methane molecule and its enclosing
dodecahedral water cage, CH$_4$(H$_2$O)$_{20}$, is a stringent test for approximate methods,
including density-functional theory (DFT) approximations. Hybrid and semilocal DFT approximations
behave erratically for this system, with three- and four-body nonadditive terms having neither
the correct sign nor magnitude. Here we analyze to what extent these qualitative errors in different
MBE contributions are conveyed to post-Kohn-Sham random-phase approximation (RPA). The results
reveal a correlation between the quality of the DFT input states and the RPA results. Moreover, the
renormalized singles energy (RSE) corrections play a crucial role in all orders of MBE. For dimers,
RSE corrects the RPA underbinding for every tested Kohn-Sham model: generalized-gradient approximation
(GGA), meta-GGA, (meta-)GGA hybrids, as well as the optimized effective potential at the correlated
level. Remarkably, the inclusion of singles in RPA can also correct the wrong signs of three- and
four-body nonadditive energies as well as mitigate the excessive higher-order contributions
to the MBE. The RPA errors are dominated by the contributions of compact clusters. As a workable method
for large systems, we propose to replace those compact contributions with CCSD(T) energies and
to sum up the remaining many-body contributions up to infinity with supermolecular or periodic
RPA. As a demonstration of this approach, we show that for RPA(PBE0)+RSE it suffices to apply CCSD(T)
to dimers and 30 compact, hydrogen-bonded trimers to get the methane-water cage interaction energy
to within 1.6% of the reference value.

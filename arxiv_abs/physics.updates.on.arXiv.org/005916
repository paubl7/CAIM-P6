The diurnal cycle CO$_2$ emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production reflect seasonality,
weather conditions, working days, and more recently the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here,
for the first time we provide a daily CO$_2$ emission dataset for the whole year of 2020 calculated
from inventory and near-real-time activity data (called Carbon Monitor project: https://carbonmonitor.org).
It was previously suggested from preliminary estimates that did not cover the entire year of 2020
that the pandemics may have caused more than 8% annual decline of global CO$_2$ emissions. Here we
show from detailed estimates of the full year data that the global reduction was only 5.4% (-1,901
MtCO$_2$, ). This decrease is 5 times larger than the annual emission drop at the peak of the 2008 Global
Financial Crisis. However, global CO$_2$ emissions gradually recovered towards 2019 levels from
late April with global partial re-opening. More importantly, global CO$_2$ emissions even increased
slightly by +0.9% in December 2020 compared with 2019, indicating the trends of rebound of global
emissions. Later waves of COVID-19 infections in late 2020 and corresponding lockdowns have caused
further CO$_2$ emissions reductions particularly in western countries, but to a much smaller extent
than the declines in the first wave. That even substantial world-wide lockdowns of activity led
to a one-time decline in global CO$_2$ emissions of only 5.4% in one year highlights the significant
challenges for climate change mitigation that we face in the post-COVID era. These declines are
significant, but will be quickly overtaken with new emissions unless the COVID-19 crisis is utilized
as a break-point with our fossil-fuel trajectory, notably through policies that make the COVID-19
recovery an opportunity to green national energy and development plans.

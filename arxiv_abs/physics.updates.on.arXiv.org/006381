The concept of critical ambient pressure is introduced in this paper. The particle escapes from
its trap when the ambient pressure becomes comparable with or smaller than a critical value, even
if the particle motion is cooled by one of the feedback cooling (or cavity cooling) schemes realized
so far. The critical ambient pressure may be so small that it is not a limiting factor in ground-state
cooling, but critical feedback cooling rates, which are also introduced in this paper, are limiting
factors. The particle escapes from its trap if any of the feedback cooling rates (corresponding
to the components of the particle motion) becomes comparable with or larger than its critical value.
The critical feedback cooling rate corresponding to a certain component of the particle motion
is usually smaller than the optimum feedback cooling rate at which the standard quantum limit happens
unless that component is cooled by the Coulomb force (instead of the optical gradient force). Also,
given that the measurement noise for the z component of the particle motion is smaller than the measurement
noises for the other two components (assuming that the beam illumination the particle propagates
parallel to the z axis), the feedback scheme in which the z component of the particle motion is cooled
by the Coulomb force has the best performance. This conclusion is in agreement with the experimental
results published after the submission of this paper. The dependence of the critical ambient pressure,
the critical feedback cooling rates, and the minimum achievable mean phonon numbers on the parameters
of the system, which is derived in this paper, can be verified experimentally. Many insights into
and subtle points about the EM force (including the gradient force, radiation pressure, and recoil
force), the EM force fluctuations, and the measurement noise are presented in this paper.

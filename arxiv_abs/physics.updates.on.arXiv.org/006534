Estimation of the initial state of turbulent channel flow from spatially and temporally resolved
wall data is performed using adjoint-variational data assimilation. The accuracy of the predicted
flow deteriorates with distance from the wall, most precipitously across the buffer layer beyond
which only large-scale structures are reconstructed. To quantify the difficulty of the state estimation,
the Hessian of the associated cost function is evaluated at the true solution. The forward-adjoint
duality is exploited to efficiently compute the Hessian matrix from the ensemble-averaged cross-correlation
of the adjoint fields due to impulses at the sensing locations and times. Characteristics of the
Hessian are examined when observations correspond to the streamwise or spanwise wall shear stress
or wall pressure. Most of the eigenmodes decay beyond the buffer layer, thus demonstrating weak
sensitivity of wall observations to the turbulence in the bulk. However, when the measurement time
$t_m^+ \gtrsim 20$, some streamwise-elongated Hessian eigenfunctions remain finite in the outer
flow, which corresponds to the sensitivity of wall observations to outer large-scale motions.
Furthermore, we report statistics of the adjoint-field kinetic-energy budget at long times, which
are distinctly different from those of the forward model. One notable difference is the high concentration
of energy within the buffer layer and its narrower support. A large and exponentially amplifying
adjoint field in that region leads to large gradients of the cost function, smaller step size in the
gradient-based optimization, and difficulty to achieve convergence especially elsewhere in
the domain where the gradients are comparatively small.

It is generally accepted that melt extraction from the mantle at mid-ocean ridges is concentrated
in narrow regions of elevated melt fraction called channels. Two mechanisms have been proposed
to explain why these channels grow: the reaction-infiltration instability and a shear-driven
instability to the growth of porosity bands. These two mechanisms have been studied extensively,
in isolation from each other, through theory and laboratory experiments as well as field and geophysical
observations. Here, we develop a consistent theory that accounts for both proposed mechanisms.
We show that the total growth rate of channels is dominantly controlled by the independent growth
rates of the two instabilities and, furthermore, by the orientation of channels with respect to
the mantle shear. By itself, analysis of the reaction-infiltration instability predicts the formation
of tube-shaped channels. We show that with the addition of even a small amount of extension in the
horizontal, the combined instability favours tabular channels, consistent with the observed
morphology of dunite bodies in ophiolites. These dunites are interpreted as relics of melt channels
in the upper mantle. We then apply the new theory to mid-ocean ridges by calculating the accumulated
growth and rotation of channels along streamlines of the solid flow. We show that the reactive instability
is the dominant growth mechanism deep beneath the ridge axis. The shear-driven instability contributes
significantly towards the margins. The most unstable orientation of high-porosity channels at
depth is sub-vertical; they are then rotated by the solid flow away from the vertical. Within the
limitations of our study, the melt bands we predict do not appear responsible for significant melt
focusing or for the shallowly dipping seismic anisotropy that has been obtained by inversions.

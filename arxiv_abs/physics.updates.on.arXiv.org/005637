This article aims to numerically investigate the combustion phenomenon of coaxial gaseous CH4
LOx at supercritical pressures. The choice of turbulence model, real gas model, and chemical kinetics
model are the critical parameters in numerical simulations of cryogenic combustion at high pressure.
At this supercritical operating pressure, the ideal gas law does not remain valid for such cases.
Therefore, we have systematically carried out a comparative study to analyze the importance of
real gas models, turbulence parameters, and chemical kinetics at such conditions. The comparison
of real gas models with the NIST database reveals better conformity of SRK (Soave Redlich Kwong Equation
of State (EoS)) model predictions with the database. Further, the computed results indicate that
the Standard k-e turbulence model with modified constant captures the better flame shape and temperature
peak position compared to other RANS based turbulence models while invoking the non-premixed steady
b-PDF flamelet model for simulating the combustion process. Furthermore, a comparative study
comparing two different chemical kinetics models indicates that the reduced Jones Lindstedt mechanism
can accurately predict the flame characteristics with the least computational cost. Finally,
we have studied the effect of chamber pressure and LOx inlet temperature on the flame characteristics.
The flame characteristics exhibit a strong sensitivity towards the chamber pressure due to the
weakening of the pseudo-boiling effect with an increase in pressure. As a consequence of lower turbulent
rates of energy and mass transfer through the transcritical mixing layer, the flame spreading becomes
narrower at elevated pressure and temperature, thereby yielding an increased flame length at transcritical
conditions.

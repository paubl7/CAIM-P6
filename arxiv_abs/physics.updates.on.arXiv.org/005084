We present the CHAOS-7 model of the time-dependent near-Earth geomagnetic field between 1999 and
2020 based on magnetic field observations collected by the low-Earth orbit satellites {\it Swarm},
CryoSat-2, CHAMP, SAC-C and {\O}rsted, and on annual differences of monthly means of ground observatory
measurements. The CHAOS-7 model consists of a time-dependent internal field up to spherical harmonic
degree 20, a static internal field which merges to the LCS-1 lithospheric field model above degree
25, a model of the magnetospheric field and its induced counterpart, estimates of Euler angles describing
the alignment of satellite vector magnetometers, and magnetometer calibration parameters for
CryoSat-2. Only data from dark regions satisfying strict geomagnetic quiet-time criteria (including
conditions on IMF $B_z$ and $B_y$ at all latitudes) were used in the field estimation. Model parameters
were estimated using an iteratively-reweighted regularized least-squares procedure; regularization
of the time-dependent internal field was relaxed at high spherical harmonic degree compared with
previous versions of the CHAOS model. We use CHAOS-7 to investigate recent changes in the geomagnetic
field, studying the evolution of the South Atlantic weak field anomaly and rapid field changes in
the Pacific region since 2014. At Earth's surface a secondary minimum of the South Atlantic Anomaly
is now evident to the south west of Africa. Green's functions relating the core-mantle boundary
radial field to the surface intensity show this feature is connected with the movement and evolution
of a reversed flux feature under South Africa. The continuing growth in size and weakening of the
main anomaly is linked to the westward motion and gathering of reversed flux under South America.

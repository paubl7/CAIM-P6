This research quantitatively and qualitatively analyzes the factors responsible for the water
level variations in Lake Toba, North Sumatra Province, Indonesia. According to several studies
carried out from 1993 to 2020, changes in the water level were associated with climate variability,
climate change, and human activities. Furthermore, these studies stated that reduced rainfall
during the rainy season due to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the continuous increase
in the maximum and average temperatures were some of the effects of climate change in the Lake Toba
catchment area. Additionally, human interventions such as industrial activities, population
growth, and damage to the surrounding environment of the Lake Toba watershed had significant impacts
in terms of decreasing the water level. However, these studies were unable to determine the factor
that had the most significant effect, although studies on other lakes worldwide have shown these
factors are the main causes of fluctuations or decreases in water levels. A simulation study of Lake
Toba's water balance showed the possibility of having a water surplus until the mid-twenty-first
century. The input discharge was predicted to be greater than the output; therefore, Lake Toba could
be optimized without affecting the future water level. However, the climate projections depicted
a different situation, with scenarios predicting the possibility of extreme climate anomalies,
demonstrating drier climatic conditions in the future. This review concludes that it is necessary
to conduct an in-depth, comprehensive, and systematic study to identify the most dominant factor
among the three that is causing the decrease in the Lake Toba water level and to describe the future
projected water level.

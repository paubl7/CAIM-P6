Racial residential segregation is a defining and enduring feature of U.S. society, shaping inter-group
relations, racial disparities in income and health, and access to high-quality public goods and
services. The design of policies aimed at addressing these inequities would be better informed
by descriptive models of segregation that are able to predict neighborhood scale racial sorting
dynamics. While coarse regional population projections are widely accessible, small area population
changes remain challenging to predict because granular data on migration is limited and mobility
behaviors are driven by complex social and idiosyncratic dynamics. Consequently, to account for
such drivers, it is necessary to develop methods that can extract effective descriptions of their
impacts on population dynamics based solely on statistical analysis of available data. Here, we
develop and validate a Density-Functional Fluctuation Theory (DFFT) that quantifies segregation
using density-dependent functions extracted from population counts and uses these functions
to accurately forecast how the racial/ethnic compositions of neighborhoods across the US are likely
to change. Importantly, DFFT makes minimal assumptions about the nature of the underlying causes
of segregation and is designed to quantify segregation for neighborhoods with different total
populations in regions with different compositions. This quantification can be used to accurately
forecast both average changes in neighborhood compositions and the likelihood of more drastic
changes such as those associated with gentrification and neighborhood tipping. As such, DFFT provides
a powerful framework for researchers and policy makers alike to better quantify and forecast neighborhood-scale
segregation and its associated dynamics.

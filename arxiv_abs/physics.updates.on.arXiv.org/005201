There is evidence that a natural control system influences global atmospheric surface temperature
(Leggett and Ball, 2020). The present paper sets up and tests a hypothesis concerning the physical
makeup of the sequential elements of the control system and its outcomes. The final outcome the control
system influences is defined as global atmospheric surface temperature. The terms used for the
control system element types in the hypothesis are, in sequence, leading element, controller and
actuator. Actuators are hypothesised to affect in turn the final outcome either directly or via
penultimate outcomes. The existence of the control system is evidenced by demonstration of statistically
significant one way Granger causality across each step of the hypothesised control system sequence.
Evidence is presented that the leading element of the control system, represented by the Normalized
Difference Vegetation Index, is the global biosphere. The biosphere as a control system has previously
been referred to as Gaia (Lovelock and Margulis, 1974). A fourth (second derivative) term is found
to enhance the Proportional, Integral and Derivative process terms of the control system shown
in Leggett and Ball (2020). The main actuators of the control system found are shown to be wind speed
and cloud cover. Cloud cover is shown to influence the final outcome, global surface temperature,
directly. It and wind speed also influence the penultimate outcomes found, those of enhanced ocean
heat uptake and enhanced outgoing longwave radiation. These together lead to control system output
to the final outcome, global atmospheric temperature. Overall, evidence for the activity of the
control system is present across many major physical dimensions of the global atmosphere.

Spin-orbit torque (SOT) is an emerging technology that enables the efficient manipulation of spintronic
devices. The initial processes of interest in SOTs involved electric fields, spin-orbit coupling,
conduction electron spins and magnetization. More recently interest has grown to include a variety
of other processes that include phonons, magnons, or heat. Over the past decade, many materials
have been explored to achieve a larger SOT efficiency. Recently, holistic design to maximize the
performance of SOT devices has extended material research from a nonmagnetic layer to a magnetic
layer. The rapid development of SOT has spurred a variety of SOT-based applications. In this Roadmap
paper, we first review the theories of SOTs by introducing the various mechanisms thought to generate
or control SOTs, such as the spin Hall effect, the Rashba-Edelstein effect, the orbital Hall effect,
thermal gradients, magnons, and strain effects. Then, we discuss the materials that enable these
effects, including metals, metallic alloys, topological insulators, two-dimensional materials,
and complex oxides. We also discuss the important roles in SOT devices of different types of magnetic
layers. Afterward, we discuss device applications utilizing SOTs. We discuss and compare three-terminal
and two-terminal SOT-magnetoresistive random-access memories (MRAMs); we mention various schemes
to eliminate the need for an external field. We provide technological application considerations
for SOT-MRAM and give perspectives on SOT-based neuromorphic devices and circuits. In addition
to SOT-MRAM, we present SOT-based spintronic terahertz generators, nano-oscillators, and domain
wall and skyrmion racetrack memories. This paper aims to achieve a comprehensive review of SOT theory,
materials, and applications, guiding future SOT development in both the academic and industrial
sectors.

Rotating detonation combustion (RDC) fuelled with partially pre-vaporized n-heptane sprays
and gaseous hydrogen is studied with an Eulerian-Lagrangian method. Our focus is the effects of
pre-vaporized n-heptane equivalence ratios and droplet diameters on detonation wave propagation
and droplet dynamics in two-phase RDC. The results show that when the droplets are small, they are
fully vaporized by the detonation wave. However, when the droplet diameter is relatively large
and/or the detonation wave number is bifurcated, liquid droplets are observable beyond the refill
zone. Moreover, the detonation speed is considerably influenced by the droplet pre-vaporization
and diameter. The velocity deficits vary between 5% and 30%. Over 70% n-heptane is detonated in the
simulated cases, and there exists a critical droplet diameter (about 20 um), around which the detonated
fuel fraction is minimal. Four droplet trajectories in RDC are identified, which are differentiated
by various evaporation times, residence times and interactions between droplets and the basic
RDC flow structures. Inside the refill zone, three droplet categories are qualitatively identified.
Droplets injected at the right end of the refill zone directly interact with the deflagration surface
and meanwhile have relatively long residence time. However, droplets injected closer to the travelling
detonation front have insufficient time to be heated and vaporized. Our results also demonstrate
that when pre-vaporization level is low and initial droplet diameter is large, the liquid fuel droplets
may disperse towards the combustor exit. Furthermore, the droplet dispersion height decreases
with liquid fuel pre-vaporization, while increases with droplet diameter.

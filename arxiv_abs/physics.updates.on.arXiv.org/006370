Among all tissue imaging modalities, photo-acoustic tomography (PAT) has been getting increasing
attention in the recent past due to the fact that it has high contrast, high penetrability, and has
capability of retrieving high resolution. Model-based regularized reconstruction methods used
in PAT plays a crucial role in the applicability of PAT because such methods can yield high quality
images from measurements obtained using fewer number of transducers. A crucial factor that determines
the quality of reconstruction in such methods is the choice of regularization weight. Unfortunately,
an appropriately tuned value of regularization weight varies significantly with variation in
the noise level, as well as, with the variation in the high resolution contents of the image, in a way
that has not been well understood. There has been attempts to determine optimum regularization
weight from the measured data in the context of using elementary and general purpose regularizations.
In this paper, we develop a practicable method for semi-automated tuning of the regularization
weight in the context of using a modern type of regularization that is specifically designed for
PAT image reconstruction. As a first step, we introduce a relative smoothness constraint with a
parameter; this parameter computationally maps into the actual regularization weight, but, its
tuning does not vary significantly with variation in the noise level, and with the variation in the
high resolution contents of the image. Next, we construct an algorithm that integrates the task
of determining this mapping along with obtaining the reconstruction. Finally we demonstrate experimentally
that we can run this algorithm with a nominal value of the relative smoothness parameter -- a value
independent of the noise level and the structure of the underlying image -- to obtain good quality
reconstructions.

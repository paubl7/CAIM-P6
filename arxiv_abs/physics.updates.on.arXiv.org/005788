Dual-comb sources with equally spaced and low phase noise frequency lines are of great importance
for high resolution spectroscopy and metrology. In the terahertz frequency range, electrically
pumped semiconductor quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are suitable candidates for frequency comb
and dual-comb operation. For a single laser frequency comb, the repetition rate can be locked using
a microwave injection locking and the carrier frequency can be locked to a highly stable source.
However, for the locking of two laser combs, four frequencies (two repetition rates and two carrier
offset frequencies) should be simultaneously locked; If one only refers to the dual-comb signal,
two relative frequencies, i.e., the offset frequency and repetition frequency of one laser against
those of the other laser, should be locked. Although the locking techniques that have been successfully
used for a single laser comb can be, in principle, applied to a dual-comb laser source, the complete
locking considerably complicates the implementation of such a system. Here, we propose a method
to stabilize a terahertz QCL dual-comb source by phase locking one of the dual-comb lines to a radio
frequency (RF) synthesizer. This technique forces one of the lasers to follow the tone of the other
one (keeping the sum of the carrier offset frequency difference and repetition frequency difference
between the two laser combs as a constant) by exploiting a laser self-detection that avoids the use
of an external detector. Through the demonstration of this locking technique, we demonstrate that
the dual-comb can generate periodic pulses over a 2 us time scale, showing that the terahertz QCL
comb without a control of the repetition rate can produce pulsed-type waveforms.

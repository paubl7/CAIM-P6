The bottleneck for an attosecond science experiment is concluded to be the lack of a high-peak-power
isolated attosecond pulse source. Therefore, currently, generating an intense attosecond pulse
would be one of the highest priority goals. In this paper, we review a TW-class parallel three-channel
waveform synthesizer for generating a gigawatt-scale soft-x-ray isolated attosecond pulse (IAP)
using high-order harmonics generation (HHG). Simultaneously, using several stabilization methods,
namely, the low-repetition-rate laser carrier-envelope phase stabilization, Mach-Zehnder
interferometer, balanced optical cross-correlator, and beam-pointing stabilizer, we demonstrate
a stable 50-mJ three-channel optical-waveform synthesizer with a peak power at the multi-TW level.
This optical-waveform synthesizer is capable of creating a stable intense optical field for generating
an intense continuum harmonic beam thanks to the successful stabilization of all the parameters.
Furthermore, the precision control of shot-to-shot reproducible synthesized waveforms is achieved.
Through the HHG process employing a loose-focusing geometry, an intense shot-to-shot stable supercontinuum
(50-70 eV) is generated in an argon gas cell. This continuum spectrum supports an IAP with a transform-limited
duration of 170 as and a submicrojoule pulse energy, which allows the generation of a GW-scale IAP.
Another supercontinuum in the soft-x-ray region with higher photon energy of approximately 100-130
eV is also generated in neon gas from the synthesizer. The transform-limited pulse duration is 106
as. According to this work, the enhancement of HHG output through optimized waveform synthesis
is experimentally proved. The high-energy multicycle pulse with 10-Hz repetition rate is proved
to have the same controllability for optimized waveform synthesis for HHG as few- or subcycle pulses
from a 1-kHz laser.

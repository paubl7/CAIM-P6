An approach is introduced for the non-parametric reconstruction of the statistical properties
of penetrable, isotropic randomly rough surfaces from in-plane, co-polarized light scattering
data. Starting from expressions within the Kirchhoff approximation for the light scattered diffusely
by a two-dimensional randomly rough surface, an analytic expression for the normalized surface
height correlation function is obtained as an integral over the in-plane and co-polarized scattering
data with the introduction of only a couple of additional approximations. The inversion approach
consists of two main steps. In the first step the surface roughness is estimated. Next, this value
is used to obtain the functional form of the surface height correlation function without initially
assuming any particular form for this function (non-parametric inversion). The input data used
in validating this inversion approach consist of in-plane and co-polarized scattering data obtained
for different forms of the correlation function by either computer simulations or by experiments
for two-dimensional randomly rough dielectric or metallic surfaces. Good agreement was obtained
between the correlation function and surface roughness obtained during the reconstruction and
the corresponding quantities assumed when generating the input scattering data; this was the case
for both dielectric and metallic surfaces, for both p- and s-polarized light, and for different
polar angles of incidence. The proposed inversion approach provides an accurate, efficient, robust
and contact-less method based on in-plane and co-polarized scattering data for the non-parametric
characterization of the statistical properties of isotropic two-dimensional randomly rough
dielectric and metallic surface.

The remarkable progress in the field of laser spectroscopy induced by the invention of the frequency-comb
laser has enabled many new high-precision tests of fundamental theory and searches for new physics.
Extending frequency-comb based spectroscopy techniques to the vacuum (VUV) and extreme ultraviolet
(XUV) spectral range would enable measurements in e.g. heavier hydrogen-like systems and open
up new possibilities for tests of quantum electrodynamics and measurements of fundamental constants.
The main approaches rely on high-harmonic generation (HHG), which is known to induce spurious phase
shifts from plasma formation. After our initial report (Physical Review Letters 123, 143001 (2019)),
we give a detailed account of how the Ramsey-comb technique is used to probe the plasma dynamics with
high precision, and enables accurate spectroscopy in the VUV. A series of Ramsey fringes is recorded
to track the phase evolution of a superposition state in xenon atoms, excited by two up-converted
frequency-comb pulses. Phase shifts of up to 1 rad induced by HHG were observed at ns timescales and
with mrad-level accuracy at $110$ nm. Such phase shifts could be reduced to a negligible level, enabling
us to measure the $5p^6 \rightarrow 5p^5 8s~^2[3/2]_1$ transition frequency in $^{132}Xe$ at 110
nm (seventh harmonic) with sub-MHz accuracy. The obtained value is $10^4$ times more precise than
the previous determination and the fractional accuracy of $2.3 \times 10^{-10}$ is $3.6$ times
better than the previous best spectroscopic measurement using HHG. The isotope shifts between
$^{132}Xe$ and two other isotopes were determined with an accuracy of $420$ kHz. The method can be
readily extended to achieve kHz-level accuracy, e.g. to measure the $1S-2S$ transition in $He^+$.
Therefore, the Ramsey-comb method shows great promise for high-precision spectroscopy of targets
requiring VUV and XUV wavelengths.

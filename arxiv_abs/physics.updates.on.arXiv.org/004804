Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) and the Shannon-Hartley channel capacity are metrics that help
define the loss of known information while transferring data through a noisy channel. These metrics
cannot be used for quantifying the opposite process: the harvesting of new information. Correlation
functions and correlation coefficients do play an important role in collecting new information
from noisy sources. However, Bershad and Rockmore [1974] based their formulas on contradictory
a priori assumptions in Real-space and in Fourier-space. Their formulations were subsequently
copied literally to the practical science of electron microscopy, where those a priori assumptions
now distort most quality metrics in Cryo-EM. Cryo-EM became a great success in recent years [Wiley
Award 2017; Nobel prize for Chemistry 2017] and became the method of choice for revealing structures
of biological complexes like ribosomes, viruses, or corona-virus spikes, vitally important during
the current COVID-19 pandemic. Those early misconceptions now interfere with the objective comparison
of independently obtained results. We found that the roots of these problems significantly pre-date
those 1970s publications and were already inherent in the original SNR definitions. We here propose
novel metrics to assess the amount of information harvested in an experiment, information which
is measured in bits. These new metrics assess the total amount of information collected on an object,
as well as the information density distribution within that object. The new metrics can be applied
everywhere where data is collected, processed, compressed, or compared. As an example, we compare
the structures of two recently published SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. We also introduce new metrics
for transducer-quality assessment in many sciences including: cryo-EM, biomedical imaging,
microscopy, signal processing, photography, tomography, etc.

Purpose: We propose a general framework for quantifying predictive uncertainties of dose-related
quantities and leveraging this information in a dose mimicking problem in the context of automated
radiation therapy treatment planning. Methods: A three-step pipeline, comprising feature extraction,
dose statistic prediction and dose mimicking, is employed. In particular, the features are produced
by a convolutional variational autoencoder and used as inputs in a previously developed nonparametric
Bayesian statistical method, estimating the multivariate predictive distribution of a collection
of predefined dose statistics. Specially developed objective functions are then used to construct
a probabilistic dose mimicking problem based on the produced distributions, creating deliverable
treatment plans. Results: The numerical experiments are performed using a dataset of 94 retrospective
treatment plans of prostate cancer patients. We show that the features extracted by the variational
autoencoder capture geometric information of substantial relevance to the dose statistic prediction
problem and are related to dose statistics in a more regularized fashion than hand-crafted features.
The estimated predictive distributions are reasonable and outperforms a non-input-dependent
benchmark method, and the deliverable plans produced by the probabilistic dose mimicking agree
better with their clinical counterparts than for a non-probabilistic formulation. Conclusions:
We demonstrate that prediction of dose-related quantities may be extended to include uncertainty
estimation and that such probabilistic information may be leveraged in a dose mimicking problem.
The treatment plans produced by the proposed pipeline resemble their original counterparts well,
illustrating the merits of a holistic approach to automated planning based on probabilistic modeling.

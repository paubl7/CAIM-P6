The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations are continuum models used in the study of a wide range
of plasma physics systems, including the evolution of complex plasma dynamics in tokamak disruptions.
However, efficient numerical solution methods for MHD are extremely challenging due to disparate
time and length scales, strong hyperbolic phenomena, and nonlinearity. Therefore the development
of scalable, implicit MHD algorithms and high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement strategies
is of considerable importance. In this work, we develop a high-order stabilized finite-element
algorithm for the reduced visco-resistive MHD equations based on the MFEM finite element library
(mfem.org). The scheme is fully implicit, solved with the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK)
method with a physics-based preconditioning strategy. Our preconditioning strategy is a generalization
of the physics-based preconditioning methods in [Chacon, et al, JCP 2002] to adaptive, stabilized
finite elements. Algebraic multigrid methods are used to invert sub-block operators to achieve
scalability. A parallel adaptive mesh refinement scheme with dynamic load-balancing is implemented
to efficiently resolve the multi-scale spatial features of the system. Our implementation uses
the MFEM framework, which provides arbitrary-order polynomials and flexible adaptive conforming
and non-conforming meshes capabilities. Results demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability
of the implicit scheme in the presence of large scale disparity. The potential of the AMR approach
is demonstrated on an island coalescence problem in the high Lundquist-number regime ($\ge 10^7$)
with the successful resolution of plasmoid instabilities and thin current sheets.

Gas turbine combustion chambers contain numerous smallscale features that help to dampen acoustic
waves and alter the acoustic mode shapes. This damping helps to alleviate problems such as thermoacoustic
instabilities. During computational fluid dynamics simulations (CFD) of combustion chambers,
these small-scale features are often neglected as the corresponding increase in the mesh cell count
augments significantly the cost of simulation while the small physical size of these cells can present
problems for the stability of the solver. In problems where acoustics are prevalent and critical
to the validity of the simulation, the neglected small-scale features and the associated reduction
in overall acoustic damping can cause problems with spurious, nonphysical noise and prevents accurate
simulation of transients and limit cycle oscillations. Low-order dynamical systems (LODS) and
artificial neural networks (ANNs) are proposed and tested in their ability to represent a simple
two-dimensional acoustically forced simulation of an orifice at multiple frequencies. These
models were built using compressible CFD, using OpenFOAM, of an orifice placed between two ducts.
The acoustic impedance of the orifice has been computed using the multi-microphone method and compared
to a commonly used analytical model. Following this, the flow field downstream of the orifice has
been modelled using both a LODS and ANN model. Both methods have shown the ability to closely represent
the simulated dynamical flows at much lower computational cost than the original CFD simulation.
Such models may also assist in the accurate simulation of flame quenching due to cooling flows or
the design of effusion cooled aerodynamic surfaces such as nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) and turbine
blades.

Measuring close proximity interactions between individuals can provide key information on social
contacts in human communities. With the present study, we report the quantitative assessment of
contact patterns in a village in rural Malawi, based on proximity sensors technology that allows
for high-resolution measurements of social contacts. The system provided information on community
structure of the village, on social relationships and social assortment between individuals,
and on daily contacts activity within the village. Our findings revealed that the social network
presented communities that were highly correlated with household membership, thus confirming
the importance of family ties within the village. Contacts within households occur mainly between
adults and children, and adults and adolescents. This result suggests that the principal role of
adults within the family is the care for the youngest. Most of the inter-household interactions
occurred among caregivers and among adolescents. We studied the tendency of participants to interact
with individuals with whom they shared similar attributes (i.e., assortativity). Age and gender
assortativity were observed in inter-household network, showing that individuals not belonging
to the same family group prefer to interact with people with whom they share similar age and gender.
Age disassortativity is observed in intra-household networks. Family members congregate in the
early morning, during lunch time and dinner time. In contrast, individuals not belonging to the
same household displayed a growing contact activity from the morning, reaching a maximum in the
afternoon. The data collection infrastructure used in this study seems to be very effective to capture
the dynamics of contacts by collecting high resolution temporal data and to give access to the level
of information needed to understand the social context of the village.

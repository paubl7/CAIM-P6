Large-scale modelling of three-dimensional controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) surveys
used to be feasible only for large companies and research consortia. This has changed over the last
few years, and today there exists a selection of different open-source codes available to everyone.
Using four different codes in the Python ecosystem, we perform simulations for increasingly complex
models in a shallow marine setting. We first verify the computed fields with semi-analytical solutions
for a simple layered model. Then we validate the responses of a more complex block model by comparing
results obtained from each code. Finally we compare the responses of a real world model with results
from the industry. On the one hand, these validations show that the open-source codes are able to
compute comparable CSEM responses for challenging, large-scale models. On the other hand, they
show many general and method-dependent problems that need to be faced for obtaining accurate results.
Our comparison includes finite-element and finite-volume codes using structured rectilinear
and octree meshes as well as unstructured tetrahedral meshes. Accurate responses can be obtained
independently of the chosen method and the chosen mesh type. The runtime and memory requirements
vary greatly based on the choice of iterative or direct solvers. However, we have found that much
more time was spent on designing the mesh and setting up the simulations than running the actual computation.
The challenging task is, irrespective of the chosen code, to appropriately discretize the model.
We provide three models, each with their corresponding discretization and responses of four codes,
which can be used for validation of new and existing codes.

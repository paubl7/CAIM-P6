The declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic has largely amplified the spread of related information
on social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, and WeChat.Unlike the previous studies which focused
on how to detect the misinformation or fake news related toCOVID-19, we investigate how the disease
and information co-evolve in the population. We focus onCOVID-19and its information during the
period when the disease was widely spread in China, i.e., from January 25th to March 24th, 2020. We
first explore how the disease and information co-evolve via the spatial analysis of the two spreading
processes. We visualize the geo-location of both disease and information at the province level
and find that disease is more geo-localized compared to information. We find a high correlation
between the disease and information data, and also people care about the spread only when it comes
to their neighborhood. Regard to the content of the information, we find that positive messages
are more negatively correlated with the disease compared to negative and neutral messages. Additionally,
we introduce machine learning algorithms, i.e., linear regression and random forest, to further
predict the number of infected using different disease spatial related and information-related
characteristics. We obtain that the disease spatial related characteristics of nearby cities
can help to improve the prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, information-related characteristics
can also help to improve the prediction performance, but with a delay, i.e., the improvement comes
from using, for instance, the number of messages 10 days ago, for disease prediction. The methodology
proposed in this paper may shed light on new clues of emerging infections

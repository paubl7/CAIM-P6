von Willebrand Factor is a mechano-sensitive protein circulating in blood that mediates platelet
adhesion to subendothelial collagen and platelet aggregation at high shear rates. Its hemostatic
function and/or thrombogenic effect as well as susceptibility to enzymatic cleavage are regulated
by a conformational change from a collapsed globular state to a stretched state. Therefore, it is
essential to account for the conformation of the vWF multimers when modeling vWF-mediated thrombosis
or vWF degradation. We introduce a continuum model of vWF unfolding, which is developed within the
framework of our multi-constituent model of platelet-mediated thrombosis. The model considers
two interconvertible vWF species corresponding to the collapsed and stretched conformational
states. vWF unfolding takes place via two regimes: tumbling in simple shear and strong unfolding
in flows with dominant extensional component. These two regimes were demonstrated in a parallel-plate
Couette flow and a cross-slot extensional geometry. The vWF unfolding model was then verified in
several microfluidic systems designed for inducing high-shear vWF-mediated thrombosis and screening
for von Willebrand Disease. The model predicted high concentration of stretched vWF in key regions
of the channels where occlusive thrombosis was observed experimentally. Strong unfolding caused
by the extensional flow was limited to the center axis or middle plane of the channels, whereas vWF
unfolding near the channel walls relied upon the shear tumbling mechanism. The continuum model
of vWF unfolding presented in this work can be employed in modeling vWF-mediated thrombosis or vWF
degradation in complex geometries. However, extending the model to 3-D arbitrary flows and turbulent
flows will pose considerable challenges.

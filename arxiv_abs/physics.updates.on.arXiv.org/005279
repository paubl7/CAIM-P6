Electromagnetic hot-spots at ultra-narrow plasmonic nanogaps carry immense potential to drive
detection limits down to few molecules in sensors based on surface enhanced Raman or Fluorescence
spectroscopies. However, leveraging the EM hot-spots requires access to the gaps, which in turn
depends on the size of the analyte in relation to gap distances. Herein we leverage a well-calibrated
process based on self-assembly of block copolymer colloids on full-wafer level to produce high
density plasmonic nanopillar arrays exhibiting large number (> 10^10 /cm^2) of uniform inter-pillar
EM hot-spots. The approach allows convenient handles to systematically vary the inter-pillar
gap distances down to sub-10 nm regime. The results show compelling trends of the impact of analyte
dimensions in relation to the gap distances towards their leverage over inter-pillar hot-spots,
and the resulting sensitivity in SERS based molecular assays. Comparing the detection of labelled
proteins in surface-enhanced Raman and metal-enhanced Fluorescence configurations further
reveal the relative advantage of Fluorescence over Raman detection while encountering the spatial
limitations imposed by the gaps. Quantitative assays with limits of detection down to picomolar
concentrations is realized for both the small organic molecules and the proteins. The well-defined
geometries delivered by nanofabrication approach is critical to arriving at realistic geometric
models to establish meaningful correlation between structure, optical properties and sensitivity
of nanopillar arrays in plasmonic assays. The findings emphasize the need for the rational design
of EM hot-spots that take into account the analyte dimensions to drive ultra-high sensitivity in
plasmon-enhanced spectroscopies.

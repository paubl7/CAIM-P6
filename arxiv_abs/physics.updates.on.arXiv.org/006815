The spread of COVID-19 and ensuing containment measures have accentuated the profound interdependence
among nations or regions. This has been particularly evident in tourism, one of the sectors most
affected by uncoordinated mobility restrictions. The impact of this interdependence on the tendency
to adopt less or more restrictive measures is hard to evaluate, more so if diversity in economic exposures
to citizens' mobility are considered. Here, we address this problem by developing an analytical
and computational game-theoretical model encompassing the conflicts arising from the need to
control the economic effects of global risks, such as in the COVID-19 pandemic. The model includes
the individual costs derived from severe restrictions imposed by governments, including the resulting
economic interdependence among all the parties involved in the game. By using tourism-based data,
the model is enriched with actual heterogeneous income losses, such that every player has a different
economic cost when applying restrictions. We show that economic interdependence enhances cooperation
because of the decline in the expected payoffs by free-riding parties (i.e., those neglecting the
application of mobility restrictions). Furthermore, we show (analytically and through numerical
simulations) that these cross-exposures can transform the nature of the cooperation dilemma each
region or country faces, modifying the position of the fixed points and the size of the basins of attraction
that characterize this class of games. Finally, our results suggest that heterogeneity among regions
may be used to leverage the impact of intervention policies by ensuring an agreement among the most
relevant initial set of cooperators.

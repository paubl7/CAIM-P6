The processes of the coronal plasma heating and cooling were previously shown to significantly
affect the dynamics of slow magnetoacoustic (MA) waves, causing amplification or attenuation,
and also dispersion. However, the entropy mode is also excited in such a thermodynamically active
plasma and is affected by the heating/cooling misbalance too. This mode is usually associated with
the phenomenon of coronal rain and formation of prominences. Unlike the adiabatic plasmas, the
properties and evolution of slow MA and entropy waves in continuously heated and cooling plasmas
get mixed. Different regimes of the misbalance lead to a variety of scenarios for the initial perturbation
to evolve. In order to describe properties and evolution of slow MA and entropy waves in various regimes
of the misbalance, we obtained an exact analytical solution of the linear evolutionary equation.
Using the characteristic timescales and the obtained exact solution, we identified regimes with
qualitatively different behaviour of slow MA and entropy modes. For some of those regimes, the spatio-temporal
evolution of the initial Gaussian pulse is shown. In particular, it is shown that slow MA modes may
have a range of non-propagating harmonics. In this regime, perturbations caused by slow MA and entropy
modes in a low-$\beta$ plasma would look identically in observations, as non-propagating disturbances
of the plasma density (and temperature) either growing or decaying with time. We also showed that
the partition of the initial energy between slow MA and entropy modes depends on the properties of
the heating and cooling processes involved. The obtained exact analytical solution could be further
applied to the interpretation of observations and results of numerical modelling of slow MA waves
in the corona and the formation and evolution of coronal rain.

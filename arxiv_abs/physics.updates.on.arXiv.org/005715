We study the sub-grid scale characteristics of a vorticity-transport-based approach for large-eddy
simulations. In particular, we consider a multi-dimensional upwind scheme for the vorticity transport
equations and establish its properties in the under-resolved regime. The asymptotic behavior
of key turbulence statistics of velocity gradients, vorticity, and invariants is studied in detail.
Modified equation analysis indicates that dissipation can be controlled locally via non-linear
limiting of the gradient employed for the vorticity reconstruction on the cell face such that low
numerical diffusion is obtained in well-resolved regimes and high numerical diffusion is realized
in under-resolved regions. The enstrophy budget highlights the remarkable ability of the truncation
terms to mimic the true sub-grid scale dissipation and diffusion. The modified equation also reveals
diffusive terms that are similar to several commonly employed sub-grid scale models including
tensor-gradient and hyper-viscosity models. Investigations on several canonical turbulence
flow cases show that large-scale features are adequately represented and remain consistent in
terms of spectral energy over a range of grid resolutions. Numerical dissipation in under-resolved
simulations is consistent and can be characterized by diffusion terms discovered in the modified
equation analysis. A minimum state of scale separation necessary to obtain asymptotic behavior
is characterized using metrics such as effective Reynolds number and effective grid spacing. Temporally-evolving
jet simulations, characterized by large-scale vortical structures, demonstrate that high Reynolds
number vortex-dominated flows are captured when criteria is met and necessitate diffusive non-linear
limiting of vorticity reconstruction be employed to realize accuracy in under-resolved simulations.

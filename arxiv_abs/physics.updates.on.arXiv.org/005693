Shocks form the basis of our understanding for the density and velocity statistics of supersonic
turbulent flows, such as those found in the cool interstellar medium (ISM). The variance of the density
field, $\sigma^2_{\rho/\rho_0}$, is of particular interest for molecular clouds (MCs), the birthplaces
of stars in the Universe. The density variance may be used to infer underlying physical processes
in an MC, and parameterises the star formation (SF) rate of a cloud. However, models for $\sigma^2_{\rho/\rho_0}$
all share a common feature -- the variance is assumed to be isotropic. This assumption does not hold
when a trans/sub-Alfv\'enic mean magnetic field, $\vec{B}_0$, is present in the cloud, which observations
suggest is relevant for some MCs. We develop an anisotropic model for $\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}^2$,
using contributions from hydrodynamical and fast magnetosonic shocks that propagate orthogonal
to each other. Our model predicts an upper bound for $\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}^2$ in the high Mach number
$(\mathcal{M})$ limit as small-scale density fluctuations become suppressed by the strong $\vec{B}_0$.
The model reduces to the isotropic $\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}^2-\mathcal{M}$ relation in the hydrodynamical
limit. To validate our model, we calculate $\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}^2$ from 12~high-resolution,
three-dimensional, supersonic, sub-Alfv\'enic magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations
and find good agreement with our theory. We discuss how the two MHD shocks may be the bimodally oriented
over-densities observed in some MCs and the implications for SF theory in the presence of a sub-Alfv\'enic
$\vec{B}_0$. By creating an anisotropic, supersonic density fluctuation model, this study paves
the way for SF theory in the highly anisotropic regime of interstellar turbulence.

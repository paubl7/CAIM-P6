Range verification of clinical protontherapy systems via positron-emission tomography (PET)
still suffers from insufficient signal from low-energy protons around the Bragg peak and biological
washout of PET emitters. Here we investigate the possibilities of O-18-enriched water (18-W),
a potential contrast agent that could be incorporated in live tissues by replacing regular water,
leading to the production of the F-18 PET emitters in the last millimeters of the proton path. We hypothesize
that 18-W could also mitigate the problem of washout, as PET (F-18) isotopes created inside live
cells would remain trapped in the form of fluoride anions. To test our hypothesis, we designed an
experiment to prove that 18-W can incorporate enough O-18 into a living organism to produce a detectable
signal from F-18 after proton irradiation, and to determine the amount of activity that remains
trapped inside the cells. The experiment was performed on a chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane
tumor model of head and neck cancer. Seven eggs with visible tumors were infused with 18-W and irradiated
with 8-MeV protons, equivalent to clinical protons at the end of particle range. The activity produced
after irradiation was detected and quantified in a small-animal PET-CT scanner. The specific F-18
activity was detected in the tumor area of the alive chicken embryo up to 9 h after irradiation. Dynamic
PET studies evidenced a minimal effect of biological washout, with 68% retained specific 18F activity
at 8 hours after irradiation. Therefore, an infusion of 18-W can incorporate O-18 in animal tissues
by replacing regular water inside cells, producing a PET signal when irradiated with low-energy
protons that could be used for range verification in protontherapy. F-18 produced inside cells
suffers from minimal biological washout, allowing for a sharper localization with longer PET acquisitions.

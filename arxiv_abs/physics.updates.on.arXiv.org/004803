Simulating the interaction of fluids with immersed moving solids is playing an important role for
gaining a better quantitative understanding of how fluid dynamics is altered by the presence of
obstacles and which forces are exerted on the solids by the moving fluid. Such problems appear in
various contexts, ranging from numerous technical applications such as turbines to medical problems
such as the regulation of hemodyamics by valves. Typically, the numerical treatment of such problems
is posed within a fluid structure interaction (FSI) framework. General FSI models are able to capture
bidirectional interactions, but are challenging to solve and computationally expensive. Simplified
methods offer a possible remedy by achieving better computational efficiency to broaden the scope
to demanding application problems with focus on understanding the effect of solids on altering
fluid dynamics. In this study we report on the development of a novel method for such applications.
In our method rigid moving obstacles are incorporated in a fluid dynamics context using concepts
from porous media theory. Based on the Navier-Stokes-Brinkman equations which augments the Navier-Stokes
equation with a Darcy drag term our method represents solid obstacles as time-varying regions containing
a porous medium of vanishing permeability. Numerical stabilization and turbulence modeling is
dealt with by using a residual based variational multiscale formulation. The key advantages of
our approach -- computational efficiency and ease of implementation -- are demonstrated by solving
a standard benchmark problem of a rotating blood pump posed by the Food and Drug Administration Agency
(FDA). Validity is demonstrated by conducting a mesh convergence study and by comparison against
the extensive set of experimental data provided for this benchmark.

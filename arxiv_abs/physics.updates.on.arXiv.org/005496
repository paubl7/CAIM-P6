Low-frequency molecular fluctuations in the translational nonequilibrium zone of one-dimensional
strong shock waves are characterised for the first time in a kinetic collisional framework in the
Mach number range $2\le M\le 10$. Our analysis draws upon the well-known bimodal nature of the probability
density function (PDF) of gas particles in the shock, as opposed to their Maxwellian distribution
in the freestream, the latter exhibiting an order of magnitude higher dominant frequencies than
the former. Inside the (finite-thickness) shock region, the strong correlation between perturbations
in the bimodal PDF and fluctuations in the normal stress suggests introducing a novel two-bin model
to describe the reduced-order dynamics of a large number of collision interactions of gas particles.
Our model correctly predicts the order-of-magnitude difference in fluctuation frequencies in
the shock versus those in the freestream and is consistent with the small-amplitude fluctuations
obtained from the highly resolved Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) computations of the same
configuration. The variation of low-frequency fluctuations with changes in the conditions upstream
of the shock revealed that these fluctuations can be described by a Strouhal number, based on the
bulk velocity upstream of the shock and the shock-thickness based on the maximum density-gradient
inside the shock, that remains practically independent of Mach number in the range examined. Our
results are expected to have far-reaching implications for boundary conditions employed in the
vicinity of shocks in the framework of flow instability and laminar-turbulent transition studies
of flows containing both unsteady and nominally stationary shocks.

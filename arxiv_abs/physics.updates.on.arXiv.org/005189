I develop a novel macroeconomic epidemiological agent-based model to study the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic under varying policy scenarios. Agents differ with regard to their profession, family
status and age and interact with other agents at home, work or during leisure activities. The model
allows to implement and test actually used or counterfactual policies such as closing schools or
the leisure industry explicitly in the model in order to explore their impact on the spread of the
virus, and their economic consequences. The model is calibrated with German statistical data on
time use, demography, households, firm demography, employment, company profits and wages. I set
up a baseline scenario based on the German containment policies and fit the epidemiological parameters
of the simulation to the observed German death curve and an estimated infection curve of the first
COVID-19 wave. My model suggests that by acting one week later, the death toll of the first wave in
Germany would have been 180% higher, whereas it would have been 60% lower, if the policies had been
enacted a week earlier. I finally discuss two stylized fiscal policy scenarios: procyclical (zero-deficit)
and anticyclical fiscal policy. In the zero-deficit scenario a vicious circle emerges, in which
the economic recession spreads from the high-interaction leisure industry to the rest of the economy.
Even after eliminating the virus and lifting the restrictions, the economic recovery is incomplete.
Anticyclical fiscal policy on the other hand limits the economic losses and allows for a V-shaped
recovery, but does not increase the number of deaths. These results suggest that an optimal response
to the pandemic aiming at containment or holding out for a vaccine combines early introduction of
containment measures to keep the number of infected low with expansionary fiscal policy to keep
output in lower risk sectors high.

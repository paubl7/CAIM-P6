Objective: To investigate cardiac activation maps estimated using electrocardiographic imaging
and to find methods reducing line-of-block (LoB) artifacts, while preserving real LoBs. Methods:
Body surface potentials were computed for 137 simulated ventricular excitations. Subsequently,
the inverse problem was solved to obtain extracellular potentials (EP) and transmembrane voltages
(TMV). From these, activation times (AT) were estimated using four methods and compared to the ground
truth. This process was evaluated with two cardiac mesh resolutions. Factors contributing to LoB
artifacts were identified by analyzing the impact of spatial and temporal smoothing on the morphology
of source signals. Results: AT estimation using a spatiotemporal derivative performed better
than using a temporal derivative. Compared to deflection-based AT estimation, correlation-based
methods were less prone to LoB artifacts but performed worse in identifying real LoBs. Temporal
smoothing could eliminate artifacts for TMVs but not for EPs, which could be linked to their temporal
morphology. TMVs led to more accurate ATs on the septum than EPs. Mesh resolution had a negligible
effect on inverse reconstructions, but small distances were important for cross-correlation-based
estimation of AT delays. Conclusion: LoB artifacts are mainly caused by the inherent spatial smoothing
effect of the inverse reconstruction. Among the configurations evaluated, only deflection-based
AT estimation in combination with TMVs and strong temporal smoothing can prevent LoB artifacts,
while preserving real LoBs. Significance: Regions of slow conduction are of considerable clinical
interest and LoB artifacts observed in non-invasive ATs can lead to misinterpretations. We addressed
this problem by identifying factors causing such artifacts and methods to reduce them.

Establishing affordable, efficient, accessible, innovative, and multidisciplinary methodologies
are key to the creation of modern public policies on cultural heritage. Limited access to large-format
paintings is a challenge to restoration scientists seeking to obtain information quickly, in a
non-invasive manner, and identify regions of interest. Therefore, we put forward two unique software
tools based on multispectral imaging techniques, with the long-term aim of assessing the artist's
intentions, creative process, and color palette. This development paves the way for a comprehensive
and multidisciplinary understanding of the mysteries encompassed in each pictorial layer, through
the study of their physical and chemical characteristics. We conducted the first-ever study on
Musas I and II, two large-format paintings by Italian artist Carlo Ferrario, located in the National
Theatre of Costa Rica. In this study, we used our novel techniques to chose regions of interest in
order to study sample layers; while also assessing the works' state of conservation and possible
biodeterioration. We explored the applications of our two versatile software tools, RegionOfInterest
and CrystalDistribution, and confirmed paint stratigraphies by means of microscopy and spectroscopy
analyses. In a pilot study, we identified the artist's main color palette: zinc white, lead white,
chrome yellow, lead read, viridian, along with artificial vermilion and ultramarine pigments.
We were able to identify artificial vermilion and ultramarine and distinguish them from the natural
pigments using CrystalDistribution to map the average size and diameter of the pigment crystals
within the paint layers. This study demonstrated that software-based multidisciplinary imaging
techniques are fundamental in establishing preventive and non-invasive methods for historical
painting conservation studies and virtual restoration.

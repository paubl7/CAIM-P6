The Unitary Group adapted State-Specific Multi-Reference Perturbation Theory (UGA-SSMRPT2)
developed by Mukherjee et al [J. Comput. Chem. 2015, 36, 670 ; J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2015, 11, 4129]
has successfully realized the goal of studying bond dissociation in a numerically stable, spin-preserving
and size-consistent manner. This theory belongs to a suite of Unitary Group Adapted SS-MR theories
developed by the group, starting with coupled cluster (CC) and then it's second order PT (UGA-SSMRPT2)
which possesses all of the desirable features of generating a manifold of PEC of same or different
spatial symmetries. However, they lack invariance with respect to transformation of orbitals
in the active space. UGA-SSMRPT2 displays remarkable predictability, yet being computationally
much cheaper than it's CC counterpart. It is not immediately obvious how a state-specific theory,
generating successively higher-lying PEC one at a time, would retain sufficiently accurate information
of other close lying PEC of the same symmetry. We introduce and develop the most rigorous version
of UGA-SSMRPT2 which emerges from using the rigorous version of UGA-SSMRCC utilizing just the minimal
set of sufficiency conditions; we call this the 'projection' version of UGA-SSMRPT2 denoted as
UGA-SSMRPT2 Scheme P. We compare and contrast this approach with our earlier formulation via amplitude
equations, which we will denote as UGA-SSMRPT2 Scheme A. We also present the results for a variety
of electronic states of a set of molecules in three different situations involving weakly avoided
crossings, moderate/strongly avoided crossings and interlacing in a manifold of PECs of same symmetry.
Accuracy of our results has been benchmarked against IC-MRCISD+Q.

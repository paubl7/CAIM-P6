It is well known that the problem of divergence in the physical interpretation of quantum mechanics
originating from the uncertainty principle has not yet been resolved. Attempting to clear the constraints
and confusion of this situation for the further development of quantum technology, this article
traces the original derivation and the physical meaning of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
analyzes the Einstein photon-box thought-experiment, and studies the limits of the relationships
under different action scenarios. By analyzing the statistical distribution of quantum mechanical
quantities, the result of the destruction of the non-statistical interpretation uncertainty
relation in the electromagnetic interaction scenarios is obtained; through analyzing of the photon
box thought experiment, the logical contradiction of Bohr's argument was discovered; by examining
the set of interaction scenarios, a description method for determining the mechanical state of
microscopic particles was put forward; according to the analysis of the hydrogen atom transition
radiation process, basing on the principle of conservation of energy, the result of the lower limit
of the uncertainty relation in the gravitational scene is much smaller than that in the existing
electromagnetic scene is obtained, which mean the lower limit of uncertainty principle is broken.
The research in this article has received an affirmative answer to Einstein's God does not play dice
with the Universe. The research of this article is helpful to enhance the understanding of quantum
physical phenomena in the microscopic world, and we hope it could render some theoretical support
to investigating the physical basis of quantum technology.

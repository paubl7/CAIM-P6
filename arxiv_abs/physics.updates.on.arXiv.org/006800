We present a novel approach for data-driven modeling of the time-domain induced polarization (IP)
phenomenon using variational autoencoders (VAE). VAEs are Bayesian neural networks that aim to
learn a latent statistical distribution to encode extensive data sets as lower dimension representations.
We collected 1 600 319 IP decay curves in various regions of Canada, the United States and Kazakhstan,
and compiled them to train a deep VAE. The proposed deep learning approach is strictly unsupervised
and data-driven: it does not require manual processing or ground truth labeling of IP data. Moreover,
our VAE approach avoids the pitfalls of IP parametrization with the empirical Cole-Cole and Debye
decomposition models, simple power-law models, or other sophisticated mechanistic models. We
demonstrate four applications of VAEs to model and process IP data: (1) representative synthetic
data generation, (2) unsupervised Bayesian denoising and data uncertainty estimation, (3) quantitative
evaluation of the signal-to-noise ratio, and (4) automated outlier detection. We also interpret
the IP compilation's latent representation and reveal a strong correlation between its first dimension
and the average chargeability of IP decays. Finally, we experiment with varying VAE latent space
dimensions and demonstrate that a single real-valued scalar parameter contains sufficient information
to encode our extensive IP data compilation. This new finding suggests that modeling time-domain
IP data using mathematical models governed by more than one free parameter is ambiguous, whereas
modeling only the average chargeability is justified. A pre-trained implementation of our model
-- readily applicable to new IP data from any geolocation -- is available as open-source Python code
for the applied geophysics community.

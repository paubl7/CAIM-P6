Applicability of associated plasticity for particulate materials such as soils does not yield
satisfactory results when Coulomb's theory of shear strength of soils is assumed, and the yield
function derived accordingly is used to define both the stress state and the direction of plastic
flow. The limitation mainly stems from the fact that Coulomb's theory (and its derivatives) is a
simplification that intentionally ignores deformation characteristics that manifest from the
particulate nature of such materials. It is thus customary to apply a branch of plasticity called
non-associated plasticity for soils and similar materials. In the non-associated plasticity
framework, yield functions and plastic potential functions are different. The former defines
the mobilization of the stress state while the later defines the direction of plastic flow. For soils,
stress-dilatancy theories have become central in the formulation of non-associated flow rules.
In this paper, cyclic stress-dilatancy relations are derived based on complementarity hypothesis
of stress-dilatancy conjugates. Both loading and unloading are explicitly considered. Then,
yield functions are derived based on the resulting stress-dilatancy relations. In so doing, the
resulting yield function is rendered with a quality to be used for the modelling of deformation behavior
of soils subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. The newly derived yield functions
are called Associated Cyclic Stress Dilatancy Associated (ACStD) yield functions. The theoretical
framework is established first for special cases of deformation modes-plane strain and axisymmetric.
The framework is generalized for considering Lode angle dependency of the yield function and extending
the Matusoka-Nakai criterion.

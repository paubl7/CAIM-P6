Streamflow prediction is one of the key challenges in the field of hydrology due to the complex interplay
between multiple non-linear physical mechanisms behind streamflow generation. While physically-based
models are rooted in rich understanding of the physical processes, a significant performance gap
still remains which can be potentially addressed by leveraging the recent advances in machine learning.
The goal of this work is to incorporate our understanding of physical processes and constraints
in hydrology into machine learning algorithms, and thus bridge the performance gap while reducing
the need for large amounts of data compared to traditional data-driven approaches. In particular,
we propose an LSTM based deep learning architecture that is coupled with SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment
Tool), an hydrology model that is in wide use today. The key idea of the approach is to model auxiliary
intermediate processes that connect weather drivers to streamflow, rather than directly mapping
runoff from weather variables which is what a deep learning architecture without physical insight
will do. The efficacy of the approach is being analyzed on several small catchments located in the
South Branch of the Root River Watershed in southeast Minnesota. Apart from observation data on
runoff, the approach also leverages a 200-year synthetic dataset generated by SWAT to improve the
performance while reducing convergence time. In the early phases of this study, simpler versions
of the physics guided deep learning architectures are being used to achieve a system understanding
of the coupling of physics and machine learning. As more complexity is introduced into the present
implementation, the framework will be able to generalize to more sophisticated cases where spatial
heterogeneity is present.

Previous studies on nonspherical particle-fluid interaction were mostly confined to elongated
fiber-like particles, which were observed to induce turbulence drag reduction. However, with
the presence of tiny disk-like particles how wall turbulence is modulated and whether drag reduction
occurs are still unknown. Motivated by those open questions, we performed two-way coupled direct
numerical simulations of inertialess spheroids in turbulent channel flow by an Eulerian-Lagrangian
approach. The additional stress accounts for the feedback from inertialess spheroids on the fluid
phase. The results demonstrate that both rigid elongated fibers (prolate spheroids) and thin disks
(oblate spheroids) can lead to significant turbulence modulations and drag reduction. However,
the disk-induced drag reduction is less pronounced than that of rigid fibers with the same volume
fraction. Typical features of drag-reduced flows by additives are observed in both flow statistics
and turbulence coherent structures. Moreover, in contrast to one-way simulations, the two-way
coupled results of spheroidal particles exhibit stronger preferential alignments and lower rotation
rates. At the end we propose a drag reduction mechanism by inertialess spheroids and explain the
different performance for drag reduction by fibers and disks. We find that the spheroidal particles
weaken the quasistreamwise vortices through negative work and, therefore, the Reynolds shear
stress is reduced. However, the mean shear stress generated by particles, which is shape-dependent,
partly compensates for the reduction of Reynolds shear stress and thus affects the efficiency of
drag reduction. The present study implies that tiny disk-like particles can be an alternative drag
reduction agent in wall turbulence.

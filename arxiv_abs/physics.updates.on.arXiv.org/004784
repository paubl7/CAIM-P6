The objective of this study is to propose and test an adaptive reinforcement learning model that
can learn the patterns of human mobility in a normal context and simulate the mobility during perturbations
caused by crises, such as flooding, wildfire, and hurricanes. Understanding and predicting human
mobility patterns, such as destination and trajectory selection, can inform emerging congestion
and road closures raised by disruptions in emergencies. Data related to human movement trajectories
are scarce, especially in the context of emergencies, which places a limitation on applications
of existing urban mobility models learned from empirical data. Models with the capability of learning
the mobility patterns from data generated in normal situations and which can adapt to emergency
situations are needed to inform emergency response and urban resilience assessments. To address
this gap, this study creates and tests an adaptive reinforcement learning model that can predict
the destinations of movements, estimate the trajectory for each origin and destination pair, and
examine the impact of perturbations on humans' decisions related to destinations and movement
trajectories. The application of the proposed model is shown in the context of Houston and the flooding
scenario caused by Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. The results show that the model can achieve more
than 76\% precision and recall. The results also show that the model could predict traffic patterns
and congestion resulting from to urban flooding. The outcomes of the analysis demonstrate the capabilities
of the model for analyzing urban mobility during crises, which can inform the public and decision-makers
about the response strategies and resilience planning to reduce the impacts of crises on urban mobility.

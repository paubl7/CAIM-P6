Spontaneous emergence of organized states of matter driven by non-equilibrium conditions is of
significant fundamental and technological interest. In many cases, the organized states are complex,
hence, with some well-studied exceptions, their emergence is challenging to predict. In this letter,
we show that an unexpectedly diverse collection of dissipative organized states can emerge in a
simple biphasic system consisting of two liquids under planar confinement. We drive the liquid-liquid
interface, which is held together by capillary forces, out of thermodynamic equilibrium using
DC electrohydrodynamic shearing. As a result, the interface goes through multiple spontaneous
symmetry breakings, leading to various organized non-equilibrium states. First, at low shearing,
the shear-deformed interface becomes unstable and a 1D quasi-static corrugation pattern emerges.
At slightly higher shearing, we observe topological changes that lead to emergence of active self-propulsive
fluidic filaments and filament networks, as well as ordered bicontinuous fluidic lattices, including
a Kagome lattice. Finally, the system transitions into active self-propulsive droplets, quasi-stationary
dissipating polygonal and toroidal droplets, and ultimately to a chaotic active emulsion of non-coalescing
droplets with complex interactions. Interestingly, this single system captures many features
from continuum non-equilibrium pattern formation and discrete active particles, which are often
considered separate fields of study. The diversity of observed dissipative organized states is
exceptional and points towards many new avenues in the study of electrohydrodynamics, capillary
phenomena, non-equilibrium pattern formation, and active materials.

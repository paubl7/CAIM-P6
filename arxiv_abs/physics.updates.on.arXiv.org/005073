The exploration of non-Hermitian systems with parity-time (PT) symmetry has witnessed immense
research interest both fundamentally and technologically in a wide range of subject areas in physics
and engineering. One significant example of the principal emerging fields in this context is the
PT symmetric wireless applications using multiple coils that are spatially separated but mutually
coupled with position-dependent coupling strength. Such a spatial PT configuration limits the
flexibility and miniaturization of the PT symmetric designs. As far as this is concerned, inspired
by scattering induced two opposite whispering-gallery (WG) modes in an optical resonator, analogously
here we experimentally demonstrate a specially constructed second-order (2-nd order) PT symmetry
in a single coil resonator, whose currents with two different directions are excited by internal
bypass capacitor. Our proposed structure has the following peculiar feature: First, the bypass
capacitor induces coupling in spectral resonances allow us to observe a 2-nd order phase transition
between symmetry regimes, without the need of a second coil in the spatial PT case. Under this circumstance,
this specially constructed PT symmetry can be regarded as synthetic PT symmetry, which is enabled
by coupling modes with different directions. Second, by introducing two or more internal bypass
capacitors, the synthetic high-order PT symmetric system bearing such as third-order exceptional
point in a single coil resonator can be realized. These results will provide a new paradigm to realize
higher-order PT symmetry towards the investigation of non-Hermitian physics in a synthetic perspective,
which can be extended to other physical platforms such as optics and acoustics.

Optimizing the impact on the economy of control strategies aiming at containing the spread of COVID-19
is a critical challenge. We use daily new case counts of COVID-19 patients reported by local health
administrations from different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within the US to parametrize
a model that well describes the propagation of the disease in each area. We then introduce a time-varying
control input that represents the level of social distancing imposed on the population of a given
area and solve an optimal control problem with the goal of minimizing the impact of social distancing
on the economy in the presence of relevant constraints, such as a desired level of suppression for
the epidemics at a terminal time. We find that with the exception of the initial time and of the final
time, the optimal control input is well approximated by a constant, specific to each area, which
contrasts with the implemented system of reopening `in phases'. For all the areas considered, this
optimal level corresponds to stricter social distancing than the level estimated from data. Proper
selection of the time period for application of the control action optimally is important: depending
on the particular MSA this period should be either short or long or intermediate. We also consider
the case that the transmissibility increases in time (due e.g. to increasingly colder weather),
for which we find that the optimal control solution yields progressively stricter measures of social
distancing. {We finally compute the optimal control solution for a model modified to incorporate
the effects of vaccinations on the population and we see that depending on a number of factors, social
distancing measures could be optimally reduced during the period over which vaccines are administered
to the population.

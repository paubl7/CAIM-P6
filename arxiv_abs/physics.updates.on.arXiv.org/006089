Advances in both instrumentation and data analysis software are now enabling the first ultra-high-resolution
microcalorimeter gamma spectrometers designed for implementation in nuclear facilities and
analytical laboratories. With approximately ten times better energy resolution than high-purity
germanium detectors, these instruments can overcome important uncertainty limits. Microcalorimeter
gamma spectroscopy is intended to provide nondestructive isotopic analysis capabilities with
sufficient precision and accuracy to reduce the need for sampling, chemical separations, and mass
spectrometry to meet safeguards and security goals. Key milestones were the development of the
SOFIA instrument (Spectrometer Optimized for Facility Integrated Applications) and the SAPPY
software (Spectral Analysis Program in PYthon). SOFIA is a compact instrument that combines advances
in large multiplexed transition-edge sensor arrays with optimized cryogenic performance to overcome
many practical limitations of previous systems. With a 256-pixel multiplexed detector array capable
of 5000 counts per second, measurement time can be comparable to high-purity germanium detectors.
SAPPY was developed to determine isotopic ratios in data from SOFIA and other microcalorimeter
instruments with an approach similar to the widely-used FRAM software. SAPPY provides a flexible
framework with rigorous uncertainty analysis for both microcalorimeter and HPGe data, allowing
direct comparison. We present current results from the SOFIA instrument, preliminary isotopic
analysis using SAPPY, and describe how the technology is being used to explore uncertainty limits
of nondestructive isotopic characterization, inform safeguards models, and extract improved
nuclear data including gamma-ray branching ratios.

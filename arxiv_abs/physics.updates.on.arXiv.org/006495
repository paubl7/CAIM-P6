The market revenue for variable renewable electricity (VRE) assets has been under intense scrutiny
during the last few years. The observation that wind and solar power depress market prices at times
when they produce the most has been termed the 'cannibalization effect'. This can have a substantial
impact on the revenue of these technologies, the magnitude of which has already been established
within the economic literature on current and future markets. Yet, the effect is neglected in the
capital budgeting literature assessing green investments in the electricity sector (e.g. including
methods such as portfolio- and real-options theory). In this paper, we present an analytical framework
that explicitly models the correlation between VRE production and electricity price, as well as
the impact on revenues of the surrounding capacity mix and cost to emit CO$_2$. In particular, we
derive closed-form expressions for the short-term and long-term expected revenue, the variance
of the revenue and the timing of investments. The effect of including these system characteristics
is illustrated with numerical examples, using a wind investment in the Polish electricity system
as a test case. We find the cannibalization effect to have major influence on the revenues, making
the projected profit of a project decrease from 33% to between 13% and -40% (i.e. a loss), depending
on the assumption for the rate of future VRE capacity expansion. Using a real options framework,
the investment threshold increases by between 13% and 67%, due to the inclusion of cannibalization.
Our results likewise indicate that subjective beliefs and uncertainty about the future electricity
capacity mix, e.g.\ VRE capacity growth, significantly affect the assessment of the revenue and
investment timing.

We have developed a novel in vitro instrument that can deliver intermediate frequency (100 - 400
kHz), moderate intensity (up to and exceeding 6.5 V/cm pk-pk) electric fields (EFs) to cell and tissue
cultures generated using induced electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in a solenoid coil. A major application
of these EFs is as an emerging cancer treatment modality. In vitro studies by Novocure Ltd. reported
that intermediate frequency (100 - 300 kHz), low amplitude (1 - 3 V/cm) EFs, which they called "Tumor
Treating Fields" (TTFields), had an anti-mitotic effect on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells.
The effect was found to increase with increasing EF amplitude. Despite continued theoretical,
preclinical, and clinical study, the mechanism of action remains incompletely understood. Previous
in vitro studies of "TTFields" have used attached, capacitively coupled electrodes to deliver
alternating EFs to cell and tissue cultures. This contacting delivery method suffers from a poorly
characterized EF profile and conductive heating that limits the duration and amplitude of the applied
EFs. In contrast, our device delivers EFs with a well-characterized radial profile in a non-contacting
manner, eliminating conductive heating and enabling thermally regulated EF delivery. To test
and demonstrate our system, we generated continuous 200 kHz EMF with an EF amplitude profile spanning
0 - 6.5 V/cm pk-pk and applied them to human thyroid cell cultures for 72 hours. We observed moderate
reduction in cell density (< 10%) at low EF amplitudes (< 4 V/cm) and a greater reduction in cell density
of up to 25% at higher amplitudes (4 - 6.5 V/cm). Our device can be extended to other EF frequency and
amplitude regimes. Future studies with this device should contribute to the ongoing debate about
the efficacy and mechanism(s) of action of "TTFields" by better isolating the effects of EFs.

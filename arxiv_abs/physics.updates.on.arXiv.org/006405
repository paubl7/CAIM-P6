We present a fully Eulerian hybrid immersed-boundary/phase-field model to simulate wetting and
contact line motion over any arbitrary geometry. The solid wall is described with a volume-penalisation
ghost-cell immersed boundary whereas the interface between the two fluids by a diffuse-interface
method. The contact line motion on the complex wall is prescribed via slip velocity in the momentum
equation and static/dynamic contact angle condition for the order parameter of the Cahn-Hilliard
model. This combination requires accurate computations of the normal and tangential gradients
of the scalar order parameter and of the components of the velocity. However, the present algorithm
requires the computation of averaging weights and other geometrical variables as a preprocessing
step. Several validation tests are reported in the manuscript, together with 2D simulations of
a droplet spreading over a sinusoidal wall with different contact angles and slip length and a spherical
droplet spreading over a sphere, showing that the proposed algorithm is capable to deal with the
three-phase contact line motion over any complex wall. The Eulerian feature of the algorithm facilitates
the implementation and provides a straight-forward and potentially highly scalable parallelisation.
The employed parallelisation of the underlying Navier-Stokes solver can be efficiently used for
the multiphase part as well. The procedure proposed here can be directly employed to impose any types
of boundary conditions (Neumann, Dirichlet and mixed) for any field variable evolving over a complex
geometry, modelled with an immersed-boundary approach (for instance, modelling deformable biological
membranes, red blood cells, solidification, evaporation and boiling, to name a few)

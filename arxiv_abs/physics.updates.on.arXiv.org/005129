Competitive tournaments appear in sports, politics, population ecology, and animal behavior.
All of these fields have developed methods for rating competitors and ranking them accordingly.
A tournament is intransitive if it is not consistent with any ranking. Intransitive tournaments
contain rock-paper-scissor type cycles. The discrete Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition (HHD) is
well adapted to describing intransitive tournaments. It separates a tournament into perfectly
transitive and perfectly cyclic components, where the perfectly transitive component is associated
with a set of ratings. The size of the cyclic component can be used as a measure of intransitivity.
Here we show that the HHD arises naturally from two classes of tournaments with simple statistical
interpretations. We then discuss six different sets of assumptions that define equivalent decompositions.
This analysis motivates the choice to use the HHD among other existing methods. Success in competition
is typically mediated by the traits of the competitors. A trait-performance model assumes that
the probability that one competitor beats another can be expressed as a function of their traits.
We show that, if the traits of each competitor are drawn independently and identically from a trait
distribution then the expected degree of intransitivity in the network can be computed explicitly.
Using this result we show that increasing the number of pairs of competitors who could compete promotes
cyclic competition, and that increasing the correlation in the performance of $A$ against $B$ with
the performance of $A$ against $C$ promotes transitive competition. The expected size of cyclic
competition can thus be understood by analyzing this correlation. An illustrative example is provided.

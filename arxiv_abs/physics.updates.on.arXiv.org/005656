The steady and transient response of "dynamically" dry and moist atmospheres to uniform sea-surface
temperature (SST) is studied. Specifically, the latent heat (Lv) of water vapor is varied, so that
for small Lv, water substance is essentially a passive tracer from a dynamical point of view. Despite
the lack of SST gradients, a general circulation with Hadley and Ferrel cells is observed for relatively
stronger moist coupling. Organized precipitation patterns via equatorial waves appear to play
a significant role in tropical ascent, and along with the equatorial deformation radius, the Hadley
cell width increases with coupling strength. An abrupt switch to a much shallower tropical cell
is noted when the system becomes completely passive. In all cases, the Hadley cell is thermally indirect
and is influenced by eddy fluxes which are strong in the upper and lower troposphere. Moist static
energy is transported equatorward in the tropics and a larger amount is directed poleward in the
midlatitudes. Transient extratropical activity is seen in the form of intense warm-core vortices
for strong coupling, and these systems become weaker and smaller as Lv decreases. The drift of these
moist vortices results in the observed poleward energy transport in the midlatitudes. In the tropics,
intraseasonal variability is dominant and systematically shifts to longer time periods with stronger
coupling. In fact, large-scale, low-frequency Kelvin waves and MJO-like modes disappear as water
vapor becomes passive in nature. Finally, extreme rainfall events associated with cyclonic storms
vanish as water vapor becomes dynamically inactive. Tropospheric heating due to a saturation of
the outgoing longwave radiation results in an increase in the stability of the atmosphere for strong
coupling, and provides a plausible physical mechanism for interpreting the behavior of precipitation.

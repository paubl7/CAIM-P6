We report a linear scaling law for an electrical voltage as a function of the pressure drop in capillary
pipes and ducts. This voltage is generated by a process which is termed spin hydrodynamic generation
(SHDG), a result of the collective electron spin--coupling to the vorticity field in the laminar
flow in combination with an inverse spin-Hall effect. We study this phenomenon in laminar duct flows
with different width-to-height aspect ratios ranging from 1 (square ducts) to infinite (two dimensional
channels). First, we analytically solve the governing Valet-Fert spin diffusion equations for
the SHDG by means of the method of small parameters together with proper boundary conditions for
the set of inhomogeneous elliptic partial differential equations. Secondly, the proposed linear
scaling law is validated through a series of experiments using capillary tubes with rectangular
and square cross-sections. The experimental results show a very good agreement to the analytically
found scaling law. A subsequent substitution of the bulk velocity of the laminar wall-bounded flows
by the pressure drop reveals a universal scaling law for the electrical voltage that incorporates
all pipe and duct geometries which we could study in our experiments. Finally, the efficiency of
the system is estimated for circular pipes, rectangular and square ducts. This study shows that
the efficiency of a spin hydrodynamic generator is the same for a circular pipe and a square duct with
the same diameter and height, respectively. Hence, due to the ease of manufacturing and the possibility
to scale the experiments up to parallel settings in a compact form, micro-channels with a square
cross-section seem to be the optimum for a spin hydrodynamic generator.

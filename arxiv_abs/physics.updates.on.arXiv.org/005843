Purpose: To develop a knowledge-based voxel-wise dose prediction system using a convolution neural
network for high-dose-rate brachytherapy cervical cancer treatments with a tandem-and-ovoid
(T&O) applicator. Methods: A 3D U-NET was utilized to output dose predictions using organ-at-risk
(OAR), high-risk clinical target volume (HRCTV), and possible source locations. A sample of previous
T&O treatments comprising 397 cases (273 training:62 validation:62 test), HRCTV and OARs (bladder/rectum/sigmoid)
was used. Structures and dose were interpolated to 1x1x2.5mm3 dose planes with two input channels
(source positions, voxel identification) and one output channel for dose. We evaluated dose difference
(\Delta D)(xyz)=D_(actual)(x,y,z)-D_(predicted)(x,y,z) and dice similarity coefficients
in all cohorts across the clinically-relevant dose range (20-130% of prescription), mean and standard
deviation. We also examined discrete DVH metrics used for T&O plan quality assessment: HRCTV D_90%(dose
to hottest 90% volume) and OAR D_2cc, with \Delta D_x=D_(x,actual)-D_(x,predicted). Pearson
correlation coefficient, standard deviation, and mean quantified model performance on the clinical
metrics. Results: Voxel-wise dose difference accuracy for 20-130% dose range for training(test)
ranges for mean (\Delta D) and standard deviation for all voxels was [-0.3%+/-2.0% to +1.0%+/-12.0%]
([-0.1%+/-4% to +4.0%+/-26%]). Voxel-wise dice similarity coefficients for 20-130% dose ranged
from [0.96, 0.91]([0.94, 0.87]). DVH metric prediction in the training (test) set were HRCTV(\Delta
D_90)=-0.19+/-0.55 Gy (-0.09+/-0.67 Gy), bladder(\Delta D_2cc)=-0.06+/-0.54 Gy (-0.17+/-0.67
Gy), rectum(\Delta D)_2cc=-0.03+/-0.36 Gy (-0.04+/-0.46 Gy), and sigmoid(\Delta D_2cc)=-0.01+/-0.34
Gy (0.00+/-0.44 Gy). Conclusion: 3D knowledge-based dose predictions for T&O brachytherapy provide
accurate voxel-level and DVH metric estimates.

The activity coefficient of ionic solutions was proposed to depend on the cube root of concentration
in the early 20th century by Bjerrum (1916) and Ghosh (1918) because of the good fit with data. Ghosh
also presented a theory that assumed a lattice-like structure of the distribution of the ions. Because
that does not represent the random motions of ions, preference was given to the Debye-H\"uckel (DH)
theory that was developed not much later which proposed a square root dependence. The derivation
of the DH equation is not very easy or intuitive but nevertheless is generally understood to be the
fundamental theory, even though the cube root law describes data better. We develop a model based
on the understanding that in the dilute limit the only contribution to the activity coefficient
is the attraction between an anion and a cation forming transient `soft ion pairs'. Based on Coulomb's
law, we analyze the probability distribution of anion-cation separations in such a soft ion pair,
and the related energy. We derive an expression for the dilute limit that depends on the Bjerrum length
and the cube root of salt concentration, identical to a result already put forward by Bjerrum. For
a 1:1 salt, this cube root dependence describes data for the activity coefficient very well, both
at low and intermediate salt concentrations, as well as the osmotic coefficient, with the prefactor
correctly predicted. For 2:2 and 3:3 salts, the full theory of soft ion pairs must be used which describes
data very well, with the average ion radius as fit parameter, also describing a range of concentrations
where the data follow a cube root dependence with a slope twice or more steeper than the limiting law.
The theory can be extended to include ion volume effects, for instance via the Carnahan-Starling
equation of state.

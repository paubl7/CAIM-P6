The inflationary hot big bang model of cosmology explains the birth of the universe, the appearance
of atoms and that of large-scale structures, altogether omitting any reference to the living world.
Yet, like the physical world, the living world occupies space, is composed of baryonic matter, and
is submitted to the four fundamental forces. To bridge this break in continuity, a study relying
solely on the laws of physics was conducted to seek a pattern that would unite both worlds. Here we
show evidence of a common pattern that is based on a gravitating organization. Seven criteria were
worked out to define a gravitating concept that applies to any attractive force. A scan through the
second version of the Integrative levels classification system revealed that the following six
types of objects satisfy the criteria: atoms, eukaryotic cells, vertebrates, nation-states,
planetary systems, and galaxies. A comparative diameter study was carried out on objects confined
to the Solar System in the Milky Way. The trendline linking the average diameters follows an exponential
function f(x)=0.2527x10^6.23x, with a coefficient of determination of 0.9904. The objects assemble
into a superstructure spanning 32 orders of magnitude, systematically skipping 6.23 orders of
magnitude at each level. The unity of structure revealed in this study suggests that both worlds
result from a common underlying organizing process. Furthermore, the gradual and uninterrupted
sequence leading to complex structures supports the idea that the gravitating organization offers
a favorable pathway to complexity. The framework presented in this study may help address complex
phenomena such as emergence and agency, broaden the scope of the theory of evolution and fuel the
debate on the definition of life itself. Ultimately, it may contribute to a more complete understanding
of the universe.

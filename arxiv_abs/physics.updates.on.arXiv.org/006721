This work aims to characterize precisely and systematically the non-thermal characteristics
of the electron Velocity Distribution Function (eVDF) in the solar wind at 1 au using data from the
Wind spacecraft. We present a comprehensive statistical analysis of solar wind electrons at 1 au
using the electron analyzers of the 3D-Plasma instrument on board Wind. This work uses a sophisticated
algorithm developed to analyze and characterize separately the three populations - core, halo
and strahl - of the eVDF up to 2 keV. The eVDF data are calibrated using independent electron parameters
obtained from the quasi-thermal noise around the electron plasma frequency measured by the Thermal
Noise Receiver. The code determines the respective set of total electron, core, halo and strahl
parameters through non-linear least-square fits to the measured eVDF, taking properly into account
spacecraft charging and other instrumental effects. We use four years, ~ 280000 independent measurements
of core, halo and strahl parameters to investigate the statistical properties of these different
populations in the solar wind. We discuss the distributions of their respective densities, drift
velocities, temperature, and temperature anisotropies as functions of solar wind speed. We also
show distributions with solar wind speed of the total density, temperature, temperature anisotropy
and heat flux, as well as those of the proton temperature, proton-to-electron temperature ratio,
proton and electron beta. Intercorrelations between some of these parameters are also discussed.
The present dataset represents the largest, high-precision, collection of electron measurements
in the pristine solar wind at 1~AU. It provides a new wealth of information on electron microphysics.
Its large volume will enable future statistical studies of parameter combinations and their dependencies
under different plasma conditions.

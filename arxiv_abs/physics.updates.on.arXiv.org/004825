This work explores simple relations that follow from the momentum-integral equation absent a pressure
gradient. The resulting expressions enable us to relate the boundary-layer characteristics of
a velocity profile, $u(y)$, to an assumed flow function and its wall derivative relative to the wall-normal
coordinate, $y$. Consequently, disturbance, displacement, and momentum thicknesses, as well
as skin friction and drag coefficients, which are typically evaluated and tabulated in classical
monographs, can be readily determined for a given profile, $F(\xi)=u/U$. Here $\xi=y/\delta$
denotes the boundary-layer coordinate. These expressions are then employed to provide a rational
explanation for the 1921 Pohlhausen polynomial paradox, namely, the reason why a quartic representation
of the velocity leads to less accurate predictions of the disturbance, displacement, and momentum
thicknesses than using cubic or quadratic polynomials. Not only do we identify the factors underlying
this behaviour, we proceed to outline a procedure to overcome its manifestation at any order. This
enables us to derive optimal piecewise approximations that do not suffer from the particular limitations
affecting Pohlhausen's $F(\xi)=2\xi-2\xi^3 +\xi^4$. For example, our alternative profile,
$F(\xi)=(5\xi-3\xi^3+\xi^4)/3$, leads to an order-of-magnitude improvement in precision when
incorporated into the K\'arm\'an-Pohlhausen approach in both viscous and thermal analyses. Then
noting the significance of the Blasius constant, $\bar{s} \approx 1.630398$, this approach is
extended to construct a set of uniformly valid solutions, including $F(\xi)=1-\exp[-\bar{s}\xi(1+\bar{s}\xi/2+\xi^2)]$,
which continues to hold beyond the boundary-layer edge as $y\rightarrow\infty$. Given its substantially
reduced error, the latter is shown, through comparisons to other models, to be practically equivalent
to the Blasius solution.

The homogeneous photoluminescence spectral linewidth in semiconductors carries a wealth of information
on the coupling of primary photoexcitations with their dynamic environment as well as between multi-particles.
In the limit in which inhomogeneous broadening dominates the total optical linewidths, the inhomogeneous
and homogeneous contributions can be rigorously separated by temperature-dependent %linear
spectral measurements such as steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy. This is possible
because the only temperature-dependent phenomenon is optical dephasing, which defines the homogeneous
linewidth, since this process is mediated by scattering with phonons. However, if the homogeneous
and inhomogeneous linewidths are comparable, as is the case in hybrid Ruddlesden-Popper metal
halides, the temperature dependence of linear spectral measurement \emph{cannot} separate rigorously
the homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions to the total linewidth because the lineshape
does \emph{not} contain purely Lorentzian components that can be isolated by varying the temperature.
Furthermore, the inhomogeneous contribution to the steady-state photoluminescence lineshape
is not necessarily temperature independent if driven by diffusion-limited processes, particularly
if measured by photoluminescence. Nonlinear coherent optical spectroscopies, on the other hand,
do permit separation of homogeneous and inhomogeneous line broadening contributions in all regimes
of inhomogeneity. Consequently, these offer insights into the nature of many-body interactions
that are entirely inaccessible to temperature-dependent linear spectroscopies. When applied
to Ruddlesden-Popper metal halides, these techniques have indeed enabled us to quantitatively
assess the exciton-phonon and exciton-exciton scattering mechanisms.

Human spaceflight has been fascinating man for centuries, representing the intangible need to
explore the unknown, challenge new frontiers, advance technology and push scientific boundaries
further. A key area of importance is cardiovascular deconditioning, that is, the collection of
hemodynamic changes - from blood volume shift and reduction to altered cardiac function - induced
by sustained presence in microgravity. A thorough grasp of the 0G adjustment point per se is important
from a physiological viewpoint and fundamental for astronauts' safety and physical capability
on long spaceflights. However, hemodynamic details of cardiovascular deconditioning are incomplete,
inconsistent and poorly measured to date; thus a computational approach can be quite valuable.
We present a validated 1D-0D multiscale model to study the cardiovascular response to long-term
0G spaceflight in comparison to the 1G supine reference condition. Cardiac work, oxygen consumption
and contractility indexes, as well as central mean and pulse pressures were reduced, augmenting
the cardiac deconditioning scenario. Exercise tolerance of a spaceflight traveler was found to
be comparable to an untrained person with a sedentary lifestyle. At the capillary-venous level
significant waveform alterations were observed which can modify the regular perfusion and average
nutrient supply at the cellular level. The present study suggests special attention should be paid
to future long spaceflights which demand prompt physical capacity at the time of restoration of
partial gravity (e.g., Moon/Mars landing). Since spaceflight deconditioning has features similar
to accelerated aging understanding deconditioning mechanisms in microgravity are also relevant
to the understanding of aging physiology on Earth.

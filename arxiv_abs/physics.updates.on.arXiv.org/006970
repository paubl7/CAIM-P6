The first mention of the impedance concept appeared on November 1966 in the CERN internal report
"Longitudinal instability of a coasting beam above transition, due to the action of lumped discontinuities"
by V.G. Vaccaro. This was the beginning of many studies, which took place over the last five decades,
and today, impedances and wake fields continue to be an important field of activity, as concerns
theory, simulation, bench and beam-based measurements. Building a reliable impedance or wake
field model of a machine is the first necessary step to be able to evaluate the machine performance
limitations, identify the main contributors in case an impedance reduction is required, and study
the interaction with other mechanisms such as optics nonlinearities, transverse damper, noise,
space charge, electron cloud, beam-beam (in a collider), etc. Beam collective instabilities,
and their mitigation, cover a wide range of effects in particle accelerators and they have been the
subjects of intense research. As the machines performance was pushed new mechanisms were revealed
and nowadays the challenge consists in studying the interplays between all these intricate phenomena,
as it is very often not possible to treat the different effects separately. With the increasing power
of our computers this becomes easier but the need to continue and develop theories remains, to have
a better understanding of the interplays between all these effects: the subject of impedance and
beam instabilities in particle accelerators is far from being exhausted, as testified by the many
new instability and stabilizing mechanisms which have been recently explained or discovered.
Furthermore, in the context of the studies for possible future accelerators, some uncharted territories
remain such as, for instance, the collective instabilities during the necessary ionization cooling
for a muon collider.

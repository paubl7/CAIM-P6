Using a set of oscillator strengths and excited-state dipole moments of near full configuration
interaction (FCI) quality determined for small compounds, we benchmark the performances of several
single-reference wave function methods (CC2, CCSD, CC3, CCSDT, ADC(2), and ADC(3/2)) and time-dependent
density-functional theory (TD-DFT) with various functionals (B3LYP, PBE0, M06-2X, CAM-B3LYP,
and $\omega$B97X-D). We consider the impact of various gauges (length, velocity, and mixed) and
formalisms: equation of motion (EOM) \emph{vs} linear response (LR), relaxed \emph{vs} unrelaxed
orbitals, etc. Beyond the expected accuracy improvements and a neat decrease of formalism sensitivy
when using higher-order wave function methods, the present contribution shows that, for both ADC(2)
and CC2, the choice of gauge impacts more significantly the magnitude of the oscillator strengths
than the choice of formalism, and that CCSD yields a notable improvement on this transition property
as compared to CC2. For the excited-state dipole moments, switching on orbital relaxation appreciably
improves the accuracy of both ADC(2) and CC2, but has a rather small effect at the CCSD level. Going
from ground to excited states, the typical errors on dipole moments for a given method tend to roughly
triple. Interestingly, the ADC(3/2) oscillator strengths and dipoles are significantly more
accurate than their ADC(2) counterparts, whereas the two models do deliver rather similar absolute
errors for transition energies. Concerning TD-DFT, one finds: i) a rather negligible impact of
the gauge on oscillator strengths for all tested functionals (except for M06-2X); ii) deviations
of ca.~0.10 D on ground-state dipoles for all functionals; iii) the better overall performance
of CAM-B3LYP for the two considered excited-state properties.

The importance of fluid-elastic forces in tube bundle vibrations can hardly be over-emphasized,
in view of their damaging potential. In the last decades, advanced models for representing fluid-elastic
coupling have therefore been developed by the community of the domain. Those models are nowadays
embedded in the methodologies that are used on a regular basis by both steam generators providers
and operators, in order to prevent the risk of a tube failure with adequate safety margins. From an
R&D point of view however, the need still remains for more advanced models of fluid-elastic coupling,
in order to fully decipher the physics underlying the observed phenomena. As a consequence, new
experimental flow-coupling coefficients are also required to specifically feed and validate
those more sophisticated models. Recent experiments performed at CEA-Saclay suggest that the
fluid stiffness and damping coefficients depend on further dimensionless parameters beyond the
reduced velocity. In this work, the problem of data reduction is first revisited, in the light of
dimensional analysis. For single-phase flows, it is underlined that the flow-coupling coefficients
depend at least on two dimensionless parameters, namely the Reynolds number $Re$ and the Stokes
number $Sk$. Therefore, reducing the experimental data in terms of the compound dimensionless
quantity $V_r=Re/Sk$ necessarily leads to impoverish results, hence the data dispersion. In a
second step, experimental data are presented using the dimensionless numbers $Re$ and $Sk$. We
report experiments, for a 3x5 square tube bundle subjected to water transverse flow. The bundle
is rigid, except for the central tube which is mounted on a flexible suspension allowing for translation
motions in the lift direction.

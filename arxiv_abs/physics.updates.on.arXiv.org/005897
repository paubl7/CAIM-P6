Analyzing large-scale data from simulations of turbulent flows is memory intensive, requiring
significant resources. This major challenge highlights the need for data compression techniques.
In this study, we apply a physics-informed Deep Learning technique based on vector quantization
to generate a discrete, low-dimensional representation of data from simulations of three-dimensional
turbulent flows. The deep learning framework is composed of convolutional layers and incorporates
physical constraints on the flow, such as preserving incompressibility and global statistical
characteristics of the velocity gradients. The accuracy of the model is assessed using statistical,
comparison-based similarity and physics-based metrics. The training data set is produced from
Direct Numerical Simulation of an incompressible, statistically stationary, isotropic turbulent
flow. The performance of this lossy data compression scheme is evaluated not only with unseen data
from the stationary, isotropic turbulent flow, but also with data from decaying isotropic turbulence,
a Taylor-Green vortex flow, and a turbulent channel flow. Defining the compression ratio (CR) as
the ratio of original data size to the compressed one, the results show that our model based on vector
quantization can offer CR$=85$ with a mean square error (MSE) of $O(10^{-3})$, and predictions
that faithfully reproduce the statistics of the flow, except at the very smallest scales where there
is some loss. Compared to the recent study of Glaws. et. al. (Physical Review Fluids, 5(11):114602,
2020), which was based on a conventional autoencoder (where compression is performed in a continuous
space), our model improves the CR by more than $30$ percent...

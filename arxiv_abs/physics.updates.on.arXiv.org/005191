We employ a resolvent-based methodology to estimate velocity and pressure fluctuations within
turbulent channel flows at friction Reynolds numbers of approximately 180, 550 and 1000 using only
measurements of shear stress and pressure at the walls. The resolvent-based estimation recovers
fluctuations in the time domain by convolving measurements with a transfer function formulated
in terms of the resolvent operator obtained from the linearised Navier-Stokes equations as well
as statistics of the non-linear terms, which are treated as forcing terms. When the spatial-temporal
colour of the forcing is known, the method provides optimal linear estimation. We explore estimation
using forcing colour computed from the DNS (true forcing statistics), as well assumptions of white-noise
forcing, with and without the use of an eddy-viscosity model. The use of coloured forcing statistics
is crucial for obtaining accurate estimates; if white-noise forcing is considered, buffer-layer
structures can be estimated accurately, but errors in the log layer become significant, whereas
the combination of white noise with an eddy-viscosity model improves the estimates, preventing
large overpredictions farther from the wall. The estimation of buffer-layer structures is very
accurate, with normalised correlation between the estimated flow and DNS fields higher than 0.9
for all state variables at Re{\tau} = 180 and 550 and higher than 0.85 at Re{\tau} = 1000 when considering
the true forcing statistics. The accuracy is lower when log layer fluctuations are estimated from
the wall; however, large-scale structures are still well estimated, and the normalised correlation
between DNS streamwise velocity component and its estimation for the true forcing statistics assumption
is approximately 0.74, 0.76 and 0.55 at y+ = 200 for Re{\tau} = 180, 550 and 1000, respectively.

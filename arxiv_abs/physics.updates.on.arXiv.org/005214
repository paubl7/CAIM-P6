Among the most impactful diabetic complications are diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of
blindness among working class adults, and cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide.
This study describes the development of improved machine learning based screening of these conditions.
First, a random forest model was developed by retrospectively analyzing the influence of various
risk factors (obtained quickly and non-invasively) on cardiovascular risk. Next, a deep-learning
model was developed for prediction of diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images by a modified
and re-trained InceptionV3 image classification model. The input was simplified by automatically
segmenting the blood vessels in the retinal image. The technique of transfer learning enables the
model to capitalize on existing infrastructure on the target device, meaning more versatile deployment,
especially helpful in low-resource settings. The models were integrated into a smartphone-based
device, combined with an inexpensive 3D-printed retinal imaging attachment. Accuracy scores,
as well as the receiver operating characteristic curve, the learning curve, and other gauges, were
promising. This test is much cheaper and faster, enabling continuous monitoring for two damaging
complications of diabetes. It has the potential to replace the manual methods of diagnosing both
diabetic retinopathy and cardiovascular risk, which are time consuming and costly processes only
done by medical professionals away from the point of care, and to prevent irreversible blindness
and heart-related complications through faster, cheaper, and safer monitoring of diabetic complications.
As well, tracking of cardiovascular and ocular complications of diabetes can enable improved detection
of other diabetic complications, leading to earlier and more efficient treatment on a global scale.

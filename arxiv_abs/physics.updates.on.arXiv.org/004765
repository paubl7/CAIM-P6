Up to now, the methods available for measuring the rate constants of reactions taking place on heterogeneous
catalysts require that the catalyst be stable over long measurement times. But catalyst are often
non-stationary, they may become activated under reaction conditions or become poisoned through
use. It is therefore desirable to develop methods with high data acquisition rates for kinetics,
so that transient rates can be measured on non-stationary catalysts. In this work, we present velocity
resolved kinetics using high repetition rate pulsed laser ionization and high-speed ion imaging
detection. The reaction is initiated by molecular beam pulses incident at the surface and the product
formation rate is observed by a sequence of laser pulses at a high repetition rate. Ion imaging provides
the desorbing product flux (reaction rate) as a function of reaction time for each laser pulse. We
demonstrate the method using a 10 Hz pulsed CO molecular beam pulse train to initiate CO desorption
from Pd(332) - desorbing CO is detected every millisecond by non-resonant multiphoton ionization
using a 1-kHz Ti:Sapphire laser. This approach overcomes the time-consuming scanning of the delay
between CO and laser pulses needed in past experiments and delivers a data acquisition rate that
is 10-1000 times higher. We also apply this method to CO oxidation on Pd(332) - we record kinetic traces
of CO$_2$ formation while a CO beam titrates oxygen atoms from an O-saturated surface. This provides
the reaction rate as a function of O-coverage in a single experiment. We exploit this to produce controlled
yet inhomogeneously mixed reactant samples for measurements of reaction rates under diffusion-controlled
conditions.

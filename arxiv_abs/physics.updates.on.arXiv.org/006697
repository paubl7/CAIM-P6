Compound ion distributions, fi(v), have been measured by NASA's Magnetospheric Multi-Scale Mission
(MMS) and have been found in reconnection simulations. A complex distribution, fi(v), consisting,
for example, of essentially disjoint pieces will be called a multi-beam distribution and modeled
as a sum of "beams," fi(v) = f1(v) + ... +fN(v). Velocity moments of fi(v) are taken beam by beam and
summed. Such multi-beam moments of fi(v) have advantages over the customary standard velocity
moments of fi(v), forwhich there is only one mean flow velocity. For example, the standard thermal
energy momentof a pair of equal and opposite cold particle beams is non-zero even though each beam
has zero thermal energy. We therefore call this thermal energy pseudo-thermal. By contrast, a multi-beam
moment of two or more beams has no pseudo-thermal energy. We develop three different ways of decomposing
into a sum and finding multi-beam moments for both a multi-beam fi(v) measured by MMS in the dayside
magnetosphere during reconnection and a multi-beam fi(v) found in a PIC simulation of magnetotail
reconnection. The three methods are: A visual method in which the velocity centroid of each beam
is estimated and its density determined self-consistently; A k-means method in which particles
in a particle-representation of fi(v) are sorted into a minimum energy configuration of N (= k) clusters;
A nonlinear least squares method based on a fit to a sum of N kappa functions. Multi-beam energy moments
are calculated and compared with standard moments for the thermal energy density, pressure tensor,
thermal energy flux (heat plus enthalpy fluxes), bulk kinetic energy density, RAM pressure and
bulk kinetic energy flux. Applying this new formalism to real data demonstrates in detail how multi-beam
techniques may provide significant insight into the properties of observed space plasmas.

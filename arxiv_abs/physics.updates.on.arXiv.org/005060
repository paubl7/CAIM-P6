Biological flapping wing fliers operate efficiently and robustly in a wide range of flight conditions
and are a great source of inspiration to engineers. The unsteady aerodynamics of flapping-wings
are dominated by large-scale vortical structures that augment the aerodynamic performance but
are sensitive to minor changes in the wing actuation. We experimentally optimise the pitch angle
kinematics of a flapping wing system in hover to maximise the stroke average lift and hovering efficiency
using a evolutionary algorithm and in-situ force and torque measurements at the wing root. Additional
flow field measurements are conducted to link the vortical flow structures to the aerodynamic performance
for the Pareto-optimal kinematics. The optimised pitch angle profiles yielding maximum stroke-average
lift coefficients have trapezoidal shapes and high average angles of attack. These kinematics
create strong leading-edge vortices early in the cycle which enhance the force production on the
wing. The most efficient pitch angle kinematics resemble sinusoidal evolutions and have lower
average angles of attack. The leading-edge vortex grows slower and stays close-bound to the wing
throughout the majority of the stroke-cycle. This requires less aerodynamic power and increases
the hovering efficiency by 93% but sacrifices 43% of the maximum lift. In all cases, a leading-edge
vortex is fed by vorticity through the leading edge shear-layer which makes the shear-layer velocity
a good indicator for the growth of the vortex and its impact on the aerodynamic forces. We estimate
the shear-layer velocity at the leading edge solely from the input kinematics and use it to scale
the average and the time-resolved evolution of the circulation and the aerodynamic forces.

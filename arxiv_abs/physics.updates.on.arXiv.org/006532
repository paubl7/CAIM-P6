In this work, we present an experimental study of nanosecond high-voltage discharges in a pin-to-pin
electrode configuration at atmospheric conditions operating in single-pulse mode (no memory
effects). Various discharge parameters, including voltage, current, gas density, rotational/vibrational/gas
temperature, and electron number density, were measured. Several different measurement techniques
were used, including microwave Rayleigh scattering, laser Rayleigh scattering, optical emission
spectroscopy enhanced with a nanosecond probing pulse, fast photography, and electrical parameter
measurements. Spark and corona discharge regimes were studied with discharge pulse duration of
90 ns and electrode gap sizes ranging from 2 to 10 mm. The spark regime was observed for gaps < 6 mm using
discharge pulse energies of 0.6-1 mJ per mm of the gap length. Higher electron number densities,
total electron number per gap length, discharge currents, and gas temperatures were observed for
smaller electrode gaps and larger pulse energies, reaching maximal values of about 7.5x10^15 cm-3,
3.5x10^11 electrons per mm, 22 A, and 4,000 K (at 10 us after the discharge), respectively, for a 2
mm gap and 1 mJ/mm discharge pulse energy. Initial breakdown was followed by a secondary breakdown
occurring about 30-70 ns later and was associated with ignition of a cathode spot and transition
of the discharge to cathodic arc. A majority of the discharge pulse energy was deposited into the
gas before the secondary breakdown (85-89%). The electron number density after the ns discharge
pulse decayed with a characteristic time scale of 150 ns governed by dissociative recombination
and electron attachment to oxygen mechanisms. For the corona regime, substantially lower pulse
energies (~0.1 mJ/mm), peak conduction current (1-2 A), and electron numbers (3-5x10^10 electrons
per mm), and gas temperatures (360 K) were observed.

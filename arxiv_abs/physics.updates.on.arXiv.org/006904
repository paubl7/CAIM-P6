The ePix detector family provides multiple variants of hybrid pixel detectors to support a wide
range of applications at free electron laser facilities. We present the results of a systematic
study of the influence of radiation induced damage on the performance and lifetime of an ePix100a
detector module using a direct attenuated beam of the EuXFEL at 9 keV photon energy and an average
power of 10 $\mu$W. An area of 20 x 20 pixels was irradiated with an average photon flux of approx. 7
x $10^{9}$ photons/s to a dose of approximately 760$\pm$65 kGy at the location of the Si/SiO$_2$
interfaces in the sensor. A dose dependent increase in both offset and noise of the ePix100a detector
have been observed originating from an increase of the sensor leakage current. Moreover, we observed
an effect directly after irradiation resulting in the saturation of individual pixels by their
dark current. Changes in gain are evaluated one and half hours post irradiation and suggest damage
to occur also on the ASIC level. Based on the obtained results, thresholds for beam parameters are
deduced and the detector lifetime is estimated with respect to the requirements to the data quality
in order to satisfy the scientific standards defined by the experiments. We conclude the detector
can withstand a beam with an energy up to 1 $\mu$J at a photon energy of 9 keV impacting on an area of 1
mm$^2$. The detector can be used without significant degradation of its performance for several
years if the incident photon beam intensities do not exceed the detector's dynamic range by at least
three orders of magnitude. Our results provide valuable input for the operation of the ePix100a
detector at FEL facilities and for the design of future detector technology.

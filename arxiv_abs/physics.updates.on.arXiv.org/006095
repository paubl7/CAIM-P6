The strange visual appearance of objects is one of the puzzling predictions of Einstein's relativity.
This is mainly due to the distinction between measuring and seeing, where the former is described
by the Lorentz Transformation and the latter considers the time light rays (emitted by each point
on the object) take to reach the observer. We compute the apparent position of a point given its velocity,
initial position, and observation time. The apparent speed of a point is calculated, and we obtain
that it exceeds the speed of light when approaching the observer, similar to superluminal motion.
For parameterizable surfaces, we analyze properties (such as curvature and torsion) of apparent
shapes. The observation that a sphere retains its circular silhouette when transformed to its apparent
shape, independent of the initial conditions, is proved mathematically. Plots describing the
apparent speed and length of objects are made, and the metric tensor for a distorted sphere is calculated.
A generalized equation for the Doppler effect and relativistic aberration is derived to analyze
regions of redshift and blueshift. Using the Born-rigidity conditions, we compute the hyperbolic
trajectories of each point on an extended object given an initial velocity, position, and proper
acceleration for any reference point. The claim that a rigid body, accelerating in Special Relativity,
cannot exceed a given length in certain circumstances is justified. We obtain many non-trivial
results, which are proved algebraically and using light cones, that are tested by taking the limit
of acceleration approaching 0 to retrieve results in the constant velocity scenario. In conclusion,
these visualizations may be used by teachers to explain SR intuitively. Finally, we provide an overview
of extending the same problem to curved spacetime and explain the potential applications of this
project.

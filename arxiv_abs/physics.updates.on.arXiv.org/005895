Biomolecular electrostatics is key in protein function and the chemical processes affecting it.
Implicit-solvent models expressed by the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation can provide insights
with less computational power than full atomistic models, making large-system studies -- at the
scale of viruses, for example -- accessible to more researchers. This paper presents a high-productivity
and high-performance PB solver based on Exafmm, a fast multipole method (FMM) library, and Bempp,
a Galerkin boundary element method (BEM) package.Bempp-Exafmm tightly integrates an easy-to-use
Python interface with well-optimized computational kernels that are written in compiled languages.
Thanks to Python's rich ecosystem in scientific computing, users can perform PB simulations interactively
via Jupyter notebooks, which opens up the possibility for faster prototyping and analyzing. We
provide results showcasing the capability of our software, confirming correctness, and evaluating
its performance with problem sizes between 8,000 and 2 million boundary elements. A small study
comparing two variants of the boundary integral formulation in regards to algebraic conditioning
showcases the power of this interactive computing platform to give useful answers with just a few
lines of code. As a form of solution verification, mesh refinement studies with a spherical geometry
as well as with a real biological structure (5PTI) confirm convergence at the expected $1/N$ rate,
for $N$ boundary elements. Performance results include timings, breakdowns, and computational
complexity. Exafmm offers evaluation speeds of just a few seconds for tens of millions of points,
and $\mathcal{O}(N)$ scaling. This allowed computing the solvation free energy of a Zika virus,
represented by 1.6 million atoms and 10 million boundary elements, at 80-min runtime on a single
compute node (dual 20-core Intel Xeon Gold 6148).

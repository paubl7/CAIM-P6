The present paper reports on the assessment of different turbulence-chemistry interaction closures
for modeling turbulent combustion in the Moderate and Intense Low oxygen Dilution combustion regime.
2D RANS simulations have been carried out to model flames issuing from two burners DJHC burner and
Adelaide JHC burner which imitate the MILD combustion. In order to model these flames, two different
approaches of turbulence-chemistry interaction models are considered; while in the PDF based
modeling, two different variants are invoked to understand the applicability of the PDF based models
in the MILD regime: one is based on presumed shape PDF approach and the other one is transported PDF
approach. A comprehensive study has been carried out by comparing the results obtained from these
different models. For the DJHC burner, the computations are carried out for a jet speed corresponding
to Reynolds numbers of Re=4100, whereas the Adelaide JHC burner computations are performed for
a jet speed corresponding to Reynolds number of Re=10000. The effects of molecular diffusion on
the flame characteristics are also studied by using different micro-mixing models. In the case
of DJHC burner, it has been observed that the mean axial velocity and the turbulent kinetic energy
profiles are in good agreement with the measurements. However, the temperature profiles are over-predicted
in the downstream region by both EDC and the PDF based models. In the context of Adelaide JHC burner,
the profiles of the temperature and the mass fraction of major species (CH4, H2, O2, H2O, CO2) obtained
using LPDF approach are in better agreement with the measurements compared to those obtained using
EDC model; although, both the solution approaches fail to capture CO and OH radical profiles.

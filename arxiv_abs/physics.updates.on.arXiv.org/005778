The lack of diversity and the under-performance of underrepresented students in STEM courses have
been the focus of researchers in the last decade. In particular, many hypotheses have been put forth
for the reasons for the under-representation and under-performance of women in physics. Here,
we present a framework for helping all students learn in science courses that takes into account
four factors: 1) characteristics of instruction and learning tools, 2) implementation of instruction
and learning tools, 3) student characteristics, and 4) students' environments. While there has
been much research on factor 1 (characteristics of instruction and learning tools), there has been
less focus on factor 2 (students' characteristics, and in particular, motivational factors).
Here, we focus on the baseline motivational characteristics of introductory physics students
obtained from survey data to inform factor 2 of the framework. A longitudinal analysis of students'
motivational characteristics in two-semester introductory physics courses was performed by
administering pre- and post-surveys that evaluated students' self-efficacy, grit, fascination
with physics, value associated with physics, intelligence mindset, and physics epistemology.
Female students reported lower self-efficacy, fascination and value, and had a more "fixed" view
of intelligence in the context of physics compared to male students. Grit was the only factor on which
female students reported averages that were equal to or higher than male students throughout introductory
physics courses. These gender differences can at least partly be attributed to the societal stereotypes
and biases about who belongs in physics and can excel in it. The findings inform the framework and
have implications for the development and implementation of effective pedagogies and learning
tools to help all students learn.

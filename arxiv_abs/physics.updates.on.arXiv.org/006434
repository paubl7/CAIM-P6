We study new classes of generic off-diagonal and diagonal cosmological solutions for effective
Einstein equations in modified gravity theories, MGTs, with modified dispersion relations, MDRs,
encoding possible violations of (local) Lorentz invariance, LIVs. Such MGTs are constructed for
Lagrange densities with two non-Riemannian volume forms (two-measure theories, TMTs) and associated
bimetric/ biconnection geometric structures. For conventional 2+2 splitting, we can describe
such models in Finsler like variables, which is important for elaborating geometric methods of
constructing exact and parametric solutions. Such formulations of general relativity, GR, and
MGTs are considered for Lorentz manifolds and their (co) tangent bundles, in brief, FTMT. Off-diagonal
metrics solving gravitational field equations in FTMTs are determined by generating functions,
effective sources and integration constants and characterized by nonholonomic frame torsion
effects. Restricting the class of integration functions, we can extract torsionless and diagonal
configurations and model emergent cosmological theories with square scalar curvature, $R^2$,
when the global Weyl-scale symmetry is broken via nonlinear dynamical interactions with nonholonomic
constraints. In the physical Einstein-Finsler frame, the constructions involve (i) nonlinear
re-parametrization symmetries of the generating functions and effective sources; (ii) effective
potentials for the scalar field with possible two flat regions which allows a unified description
of locally anisotropic and/or isotropic early universe inflation related to acceleration cosmology
and dark energy; (iii) there are "emergent universes" described by (off-) diagonal solutions for
certain nonholonomic phases and parametric cosmological evolution resulting in various inflationary
phases; (iv) we can reproduce in two-measure theories massive gravity effects.

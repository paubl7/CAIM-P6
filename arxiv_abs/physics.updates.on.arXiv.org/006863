The structure and stability of atomic and molecular systems with van der Waals (vdW) bonding are
often determined by the interplay between attractive dispersion interactions and repulsive interactions
caused by electron confinement. Arising due to different mechanisms --- electron correlation
for dispersion and the Pauli exclusion principle for exchange-repulsion --- these interactions
do not appear to have a straightforward connection. In this paper, we use a coarse-grained approach
for evaluating the exchange energy for two coupled quantum Drude oscillators and investigate the
mutual compensation of the attractive and repulsive forces at the equilibrium distance within
the multipole expansion of the Coulomb potential. This compensation yields a compact formula relating
the vdW radius of an atom to its multipole polarizabilities, $R_{\rm vdW} = A_l^{\,}\, \alpha_l^{{2}/{7(l+1)}}$,
where $l$ is the multipole rank and $A_l$ is a conversion factor. Such a relation is compelling because
it connects an electronic property of an isolated atom (atomic polarizability) with an equilibrium
distance in a dimer composed of two closed-shell atoms. We assess the accuracy of the revealed formula
for noble-gas, alkaline-earth, and alkali atoms and show that the $A_l$ can be assumed to be universal
constants. Besides a seamless definition of vdW radii, the proposed relation can also be used for
the efficient determination of atomic multipole polarizabilities solely based on the corresponding
dipole polarizability and the vdW radius. Finally, our work provides a basis for the construction
of efficient and minimally-empirical interatomic potentials by combining multipolar interatomic
exchange and dispersion forces on an equal footing.

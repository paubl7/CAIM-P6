In this article, we propose a novel scalar-transport model for the simulation of scalar quantities
in two-phase flows with a phase-field method (diffuse-interface method). In a two-phase flow,
the scalar quantities typically have disparate properties in two phases, which results in effective
confinement of the scalar quantities in one of the phases, in the time scales of interest. This confinement
of the scalars lead to the formation of sharp gradients of the scalar concentration values at the
interface, presenting a serious challenge for its numerical simulations. To overcome this challenge,
we propose a model for the transport of scalars. The model is discretized using a central-difference
scheme, which leads to a non-dissipative implementation that is crucial for the simulation of turbulent
flows. Furthermore, the provable strengths of the proposed model are: (a) the model maintains the
positivity property of the scalar concentration field, a physical realizability requirement
for the simulation of scalars, when the proposed criterion is satisfied, (b) the proposed model
is such that the transport of the scalar concentration field is consistent with the transport of
the volume fraction field, which results in the enforcement of the effective zero-flux boundary
condition for the scalar at the interface; and therefore, prevents the artificial numerical diffusion
of the scalar across the interface. Finally, we present numerical simulations using the proposed
model in a wide range of two-phase flow regimes, spanning laminar to turbulent flows; and assess:
the accuracy and robustness of the model, the validity of the positivity property of the scalar concentration
field, and the enforcement of the zero-flux boundary condition for the scalar at the interface.

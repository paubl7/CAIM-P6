We present new experiments and free-swimming simulations of a pair of pitching hydrofoils interacting
in a simple school. The hydrofoils have an out-of-phase synchronization and their arrangement
is varied from in-line to side-by-side arrangements through a series of staggered arrangements
representing the two-dimensional interaction plane. It is discovered that there is a two-dimensionally
stable equilibrium point for a side-by-side arrangement. In fact, this arrangement is super-stable
meaning that hydrodynamic forces will passively maintain this arrangement even under external
perturbations and the school as a whole has no net forces acting on, drifting it to one side or the other.
Moreover, previously discovered one-dimensionally stable equilibria driven by wake vortex interactions
are shown to be, in fact, two-dimensionally unstable, at least for an out-of-phase synchronization.
Additionally, the stable equilibrium arrangement is verified for freely-swimming foils undergoing
dynamic recoil motions. When constrained, the swimmers experience a collective thrust and efficiency
increase up to 100% and 40%, respectively, in a side-by-side arrangement. However, in a staggered
arrangement where there is direct vortex impingement on a follower, an even higher efficiency improvement
of 87% is observed, which is coupled with a 94% increase in the thrust. For freely-swimming foils,
the recoil motion attenuates the performance improvements showing a more modest speed and efficiency
enhancement of up to 9% and 6%, respectively, when the swimmers are at their stable equilibrium.
These newfound schooling performance and stability characteristics suggest that fluid-mediated
equilibria may play a role in the control strategies of schooling fish and fish-inspired robots.

We demonstrate that a simple model based on Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovski-Piskunov (FKPP) equation
forced by realistic surface velocities and nutrients is skilled in reproducing the distributions
of the surface phytoplankton chlorophyll in the tropical Pacific. We use the low-complexity FKPP
model to investigate the scale-relationships in the impact of different drivers (diffusion, mean
and eddy advection, primary productivity) on the phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations.
We find that in the $1/4^{\circ}$ model, advection has a substantial impact on the rate of primary
productivity, whilst the diffusion term has a fairly negligible impact. Diffusion has an impact
on the phytoplankton variability, with the impact being scale-propagated and amplified by the
larger scale surface currents. We investigate the impact of a surface nutrient decline and some
changes to mesoscale eddy kinetic energy (climate change projections) on the surface phytoplankton
concentrations. The FKPP model suggests that unless mesoscale eddies radically change, phytoplankton
chlorophyll scales sub-linearly with the nutrients, and it is relatively stable with respect to
the nutrient concentrations. Furthermore we explore how a white multiplicative Gaussian noise
introduced into the FKPP model on its resolution scale propagates across spatial scales through
the non-linear model dynamics under different sets of phytoplankton drivers. The unifying message
of this work is that the low complexity (e.g. FKPP) models can be successfully used to realistically
model some specific aspects of marine ecosystem dynamics and by using those models one can explore
many questions that would be beyond computational affordability of the higher-complexity ecosystem
models.

Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) utilises near-infrared light for imaging spatially distributed
optical parameters, typically the absorption and scattering coefficients. The image reconstruction
problem of DOT is an ill-posed inverse problem, due to the non-linear light propagation in tissues
and limited boundary measurements. The ill-posedness means that the image reconstruction is sensitive
to measurement and modelling errors. The Bayesian approach for the inverse problem of DOT offers
the possibility of incorporating prior information about the unknowns, rendering the problem
less ill-posed. It also allows marginalisation of modelling errors utilising the so-called Bayesian
approximation error method. A more recent trend in image reconstruction techniques is the use of
deep learning techniques, which have shown promising results in various applications from image
processing to tomographic reconstructions. In this work, we study the non-linear DOT inverse problem
of estimating the absorption and scattering coefficients utilising a `model-based' learning
approach, essentially intertwining learned components with the model equations of DOT. The proposed
approach was validated with 2D simulations and 3D experimental data. We demonstrated improved
absorption and scattering estimates for targets with a mix of smooth and sharp image features, implying
that the proposed approach could learn image features that are difficult to model using standard
Gaussian priors. Furthermore, it was shown that the approach can be utilised in compensating for
modelling errors due to coarse discretisation enabling computationally efficient solutions.
Overall, the approach provided improved computation times compared to a standard Gauss-Newton
iteration.

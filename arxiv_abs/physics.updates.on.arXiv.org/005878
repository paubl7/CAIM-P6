Calibrating a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model against data leads to an improvement.
Determining {\it a priori} if such an improvement generalizes to flows outside the calibration
data is an outstanding challenge. This work attempts to address this challenge via global epistemic
Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). Unlike the available epistemic UQ methods that are local and
tell us a model's uncertainty at one specific flow condition, the global epistemic UQ method presented
in this work tells us also whether a perturbation of the original model would generalize. Specifically,
the global epistemic UQ method evaluates a potential improvement in terms of its "effectiveness"
and "inconsistency". Any improvement can be put in one of the following four quadrants: first, high
effectiveness, low inconsistency; second, high effectiveness, high inconsistency; third, low
effectiveness, low inconsistency; and fourth, low effectiveness, high inconsistency. An improvement
would generalize if and only if it is in the high effectiveness and low inconsistency quadrant. To
demonstrate the concept, we apply the global epistemic UQ to full Reynolds stress modeling of a stratified
shear layer. The global epistemic UQ results point to a model coefficient in the pressure-strain
correlation closure (among others) as effective and consistent for predicting the quantity of
interest of shear layer's growth. We calibrate the model coefficient such that our RANS matches
direct numerical simulation data at one flow condition. We show that the calibrated model generalizes
to several other test flow conditions. On the other hand, when calibrating a high inconsistency
term, we get a model that works at only the calibrated condition.

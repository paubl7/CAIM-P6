We propose two stochastic models for the Coronavirus pandemic. The statistical properties of the
models, in particular the correlation functions and the probability density function, have duly
been computed. Our models, which generalises a model previously proposed and published in a specialised
journal, take into account the adoption of the lockdown measures as well as the crucial role of the
hospitals and Health Care Institutes. To accomplish this work we have analysed two scenarios: the
SIS-model (Susceptible => Infectious => Susceptible) in presence of the lockdown measures and
the SIS-model integrated with the action of the hospitals (always in presence of the lockdown measures).
We show that in the case of the pure SIS-model, once the lockdown measures are removed, the Coronavirus
will start growing again. However, in the second scenario, beyond a certain threshold of the hospital
capacities, the Coronavirus is not only kept under control, but its capacity to spread tends to diminish
in time. Therefore, the combined effect of the lockdown measures with the action of the hospitals
and health Institutes is able to contain and dampen the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. This result
can be used during a period of time when the massive distribution of delivery of a limited number of
vaccines in a given population is not yet feasible. By way of example, we analysed the data for USA
and France where the intensities of the noise have been estimated by Statistical Mechanics. In particular,
for USA we have analysed two possible hypotheses: USA is still subject to the first wave of infection
by and USA is in the second (or third) wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The agreement between theoretical
predictions and real data confirms the validity of our approach.

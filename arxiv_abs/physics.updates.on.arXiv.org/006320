The reconstruction and error detection performance of a Flexitron research unit equipped with
a special check-cable in which is integrated an EM sensor (NDI Aurora V3) that enables tracking and
reconstruction capability was assessed. Reconstructions of a 24 cm long catheter were performed
using two methods: continuous fixed speed check cable backward stepping and stepping through each
dwell position every 1mm. The ability of the system to differentiate between two closely located
(parallel) catheters was investigated by connecting catheters to the afterloader and moving it
from its axis with an increment of 1mm. A robotic arm was used to move the catheter between each reconstruction.
Reconstructions were obtained with a locally weighted scatter-plot smoothing algorithm. To quantify
the reconstruction accuracy, distances between two catheters were computed along the reconstruction
track with a 5mm step. Reconstructions of curve catheter paths were assessed through parallel and
perpendicular phantom configuration to the EM field generator. Indexer length and lateral error
were simulated and ROC analysis was made. Using a 50cm/s check cable speed does not allow accurate
reconstruction. A slower check cable speed results in better reconstruction performance and smaller
standard deviations. The optimum operating distance from the field generator (50-300mm) resulted
in a lower absolute mean deviation from the expected value (0.2pm0.1mm) versus being positioned
on the edge of the electromagnetic sensitive detection volume (0.6pm0.3mm). Reconstructions
of curved and circular paths with a check cable speed under 5cm/s gave a 0.8pm0.5mm error, or better.
All indexer and lateral shifts of 1mm were detected with a check cable speed of 2.5cm/s or under. A
speed under 5cm/s is recommended for straight and curved catheter reconstructions. The check cable
can also be used to detect common shift errors.

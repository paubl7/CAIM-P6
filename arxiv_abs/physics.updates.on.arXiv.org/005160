Estimation of the initial state of turbulent channel flow from limited data is investigated using
an adjoint-variational approach. The data are generated from a reference direct numerical simulation
(DNS) which is sub-sampled at different spatiotemporal resolutions. When the velocity data are
at 1/4096 the spatiotemporal resolution of DNS, the correlation coefficient between the true and
adjoint-variational estimated state exceeds 99 percent. The robustness of the algorithm to observation
noise is demonstrated. In addition, the impact of the spatiotemporal density of the data on estimation
quality is evaluated, and a resolution threshold is established for a successful reconstruction.
The critical spanwise data resolution is proportional to the Taylor microscale, which characterizes
the domain of dependence of an observation location. Due to mean advection, either the streamwise
or temporal data resolution must satisfy a criterion based on the streamwise Taylor microscale.
A second configuration is considered where the sub-sampled data are comprised of velocities in
the outer layer and wall shear stresses only. The near-wall flow statistics and coherent structures,
although not sampled, are accurately reconstructed, which is possible because of the coupling
between the outer flow and near-wall motions. Finally, the most challenging configuration is addressed
where only the spatiotemporally resolved wall stresses are observed. The estimation remains accurate
within the viscous sublayer and deteriorates significantly with distance from the wall. In wall
units, this trend is nearly independent of the Reynolds number considered, and is indicative of
the fundamental difficulty of reconstructing wall-detached motions from wall data.

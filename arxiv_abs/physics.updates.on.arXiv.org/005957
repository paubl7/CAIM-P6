Between 1966 and 1974, France conducted 41 atmospheric nuclear weapon tests in Polynesia. Radioactive
fallout impacted downwind atolls and islands leading to the external and internal exposure of the
local populations to ionizing radiation. By law, individuals who were exposed to radiation in the
context of these tests can file compensation claims with the French government if they develop certain
radiogenic cancers. A claimant who meets the basic eligibility criteria (place, time, and type
of disease) automatically benefits from the presumption of a causal link between radiation exposure
and the development of their illness, unless the exposure is deemed too low. Since 2017, an effective
dose threshold of 1 mSv per year has been used in the claims adjudication process. Decisions as to
whether claimants have met this 1 mSv threshold in a given year are often made on the basis of data from
government dose reconstruction studies carried out in 2005 and 2006. Using new information available
from recently declassified documents on the radiological impact of French atmospheric nuclear
tests in Polynesia, as well as atmospheric transport modeling of radioactive fallout, this article
shows that maximum doses to the public for key atmospheric tests may have been underestimated by
factors of 2 to 10 and estimates that the total population exposed above the compensation threshold
of 1 mSv/yr could be greater than ~110,000. This latter result corresponds to about 90% of the entire
population of French Polynesia at the time of the atmospheric tests. Integrating these updated
dose estimates into the claim adjudication process would enlarge the pool of eligible claimants
by a factor of 10. Also discussed are the legal and policy implications of these findings.

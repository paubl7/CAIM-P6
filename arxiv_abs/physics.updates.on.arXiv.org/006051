Super-resolution microscopy has catalyzed valuable insights into the sub-cellular, mechanistic
details of many different biological processes across a wide range of cell types. Fluorescence
polarization spectroscopy tools have also enabled important insights into cellular processes
through identifying orientational changes of biological molecules typically at an ensemble level.
Here, we combine these two biophysical methodologies in a single home-made instrument to enable
the simultaneous detection of orthogonal fluorescence polarization signals from single fluorescent
protein molecules used as common reporters on the localization of proteins in cellular processes.
These enable measurement of spatial location to a super-resolved precision better than the diffraction-limited
optical resolution, as well as estimation of molecular stoichiometry based on the brightness of
individual fluorophores. In this innovation we have adapted a millisecond timescale microscope
used for single-molecule detection to enable splitting of fluorescence polarization emissions
into two separate imaging channels for s- and p- polarization signals, which are imaged onto separate
halves of the same high sensitivity back-illuminated CMOS camera detector. We applied this fluorescence
polarization super-resolved imaging modality to a range of test fluorescent samples relevant
to the study of biological processes, including purified monomeric green fluorescent protein,
single combed DNA molecules, and protein assemblies and complexes from live Escherichia coli and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Our findings are qualitative but demonstrate promise in showing
how fluorescence polarization and super-resolved localization microscopy can be combined on
the same sample to enable simultaneous measurements of polarization and stoichiometry of tracked
molecular complexes, as well as the translational diffusion coefficient.

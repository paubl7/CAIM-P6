The spectral distribution of light scattered by microscopic thermal fluctuations in binary mixture
gases was investigated experimentally and theoretically. Measurements of Rayleigh-Brillouin
spectral profiles were performed at a wavelength of 532 nm and at room temperature, for mixtures
of SF$_6-$He, SF$_6-$D$_2$ and SF$_6-$H$_2$. In these measurements, the pressure of the gases
with heavy molecular mass (SF$_6$) is set at 1 bar, while the pressure of the lighter collision partner
was varied. In view of the large polarizability of SF$_6$ and the very small polarizabilities of
He, H$_2$ and D$_2$, under the chosen pressure conditions these low mass species act as spectators
and do not contribute to the light scattering spectrum, while they influence the motion and relaxation
of the heavy SF$_6$ molecules. A generalized hydrodynamic model was developed that should be applicable
for the particular case of molecules with heavy and light disparate masses, as is the case for the
heavy SF$_6$ molecule, and the lighter collision partners. Based on the kinetic theory of gases,
our model replaces the classical Navier-Stokes-Fourier relations with constitutive equations
having an exponential memory kernel. The energy exchange between translational and internal modes
of motion is included and quantified with a single parameter $z$ that characterizes the ratio between
the mean elastic and inelastic molecular collision frequencies. The model is compared with the
experimental Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering data, where the value of the parameter $z$ is determined
in a least-squares procedure. Where very good agreement is found between experiment and the generalized
hydrodynamic model, the computations in the framework of classical hydrodynamics strongly deviate.
Only in the hydrodynamic regime both models are shown to converge.

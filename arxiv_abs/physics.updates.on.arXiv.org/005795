Traditionally, academic labs conduct open-ended research with the primary focus on discoveries
with long-term value, rather than direct products that can be deployed in the real world. On the other
hand, research in the industry is driven by its expected commercial return on investment, and hence
focuses on a real world product with short-term timelines. In both cases, opportunity is selective,
often available to researchers with advanced educational backgrounds. Research often happens
behind closed doors and may be kept confidential until either its publication or product release,
exacerbating the problem of AI reproducibility and slowing down future research by others in the
field. As many research organizations tend to exclusively focus on specific areas, opportunities
for interdisciplinary research reduce. Undertaking long-term bold research in unexplored fields
with non-commercial yet great public value is hard due to factors including the high upfront risk,
budgetary constraints, and a lack of availability of data and experts in niche fields. Only a few
companies or well-funded research labs can afford to do such long-term research. With research
organizations focused on an exploding array of fields and resources spread thin, opportunities
for the maturation of interdisciplinary research reduce. Apart from these exigencies, there is
also a need to engage citizen scientists through open-source contributors to play an active part
in the research dialogue. We present a short case study of SpaceML, an extension of the Frontier Development
Lab, an AI accelerator for NASA. SpaceML distributes open-source research and invites volunteer
citizen scientists to partake in development and deployment of high social value products at the
intersection of space and AI.

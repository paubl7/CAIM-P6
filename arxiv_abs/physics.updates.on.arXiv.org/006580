We present two generalized hybrid kinetic-Hall MHD (KHMHD) models describing the interaction
of a two-fluid bulk plasma, consisting of thermal ions and electrons, with energetic, suprathermal
ion populations described by Vlasov dynamics. The dynamics of the thermal components are governed
by standard fluid equations in the Hall MHD limit $(m_e\rightarrow 0)$, with the electron momentum
equation providing an Ohm's law with Hall terms. In addition, electron kinetic effects are incorporated
upon considering an anisotropic electron pressure tensor. The coupling of the bulk, low-energy
plasma with the energetic particle dynamics is accomplished through the current density (Current
Coupling Scheme-CCS) and the ion pressure tensor appearing in the momentum equation (Pressure
Coupling Scheme-PCS) in the first and the second model, respectively. The CCS is a generalization
of the ordinary Hall MHD and the hybrid kinetic-ion/fluid-electron models, since in the limit of
vanishing energetic and thermal ion densities we recover the standard Hall MHD (HMHD) and the hybrid
kinetic-ion/fluid electron (KIFE) models, respectively. This provides us with the capability
to study in a continuous way the global impact of the energetic particles in a regime extending from
vanishing to dominant energetic particle densities. The noncanonical Hamiltonian structures
of the aforementioned models, which can be employed to study equilibrium and stability properties
via the Energy-Casimir Hamiltonian variational principle, are identified. As a first application
here, we derive a generalized Grad-Shafranov equation for translationally symmetric equilibria
with Hall terms, anisotropic electron pressure, and energetic particle-kinetic effects in the
pressure coupling scheme.

Liquid gas two phase flow is a common occurrence in various industrial applications. For nuclear
fusion applications with a Li based breeder, existence of two phase flow may lead to critical issues
including decreased tritium breeding ratio, generation of hot spots and improper nuclear shielding.
Additionally, a very large density ratio of liquid metal to gas mandates relevant experiments towards
development and validation of software tools. PbLi has gained immense focus for its various advantages
and is utilized in several breeding blanket concepts. In view of above mentioned requirements,
a two phase detection tool is imperative for liquid PbLi environment. For liquid metal applications,
electrical conductivity based probes are most suitable in terms of ruggedness, fabrication ease
and operational simplicity. However, corrosive nature and high operational temperature for PbLi
put severe demands on electrical insulation, a foremost requirement for electrical conductivity
based schemes. In this study, a multivariable probe based on electrical conductivity and temperature
measurement schemes is developed using Al2O3 coating as electrical insulation. Developed probe
is validated in PbLi/Ar vertical column with bulk PbLi temperature upto 400 degC and time averaged
void fraction upto 0.95 covering flow regimes from dispersed bubbly flow upto in box loss of coolant
accident. Developed probe provides high reliability and excellent temporal resolution towards
individual bubble detection through electrical conductivity based principle alongwith simultaneous
two phase temperature trends. Present paper provides details about sensor probe fabrication,
calibration, two phase test facility, void fraction estimations, bubble frequency and bubble
residence time estimations alongwith critical observations from preliminary experimental investigations.

Direct current (DC) converters play an essential role in electronic circuits. Conventional high-efficiency
DC voltage converters, especially step-up type, rely on switch-mode operation, where energy is
periodically stored within and released from inductors and/or capacitors connected in a variety
of circuit topologies. However, since these energy storage components, especially inductors,
are difficult to scale down, miniaturization of switching converters for on-chip or in-package
electronics faces fundamental challenges. Furthermore, the resulting switching currents produce
electromagnetic noise, which can cause interference problems in nearby circuits, and even acoustic
noise and mechanical vibrations that deteriorate the environment. In order to overcome the limitations
of switch-mode converters, photonic transformers, where voltage conversion is achieved through
the use of light emission and detection processes, have been demonstrated. However, the demonstrated
efficiency is significantly below that of the switch-mode converter. Here we perform a theoretical
analysis based on detailed balance, which shows that with a monolithically integrated design that
enables efficient photon transport, the photonic transformer can operate with a near-unity conversion
efficiency and high voltage conversion ratio. We validate the theoretical analysis with an experiment
on a transformer constructed with off-the-shelf discrete components. Our experiment showcases
near noiseless operation, as well as a voltage conversion ratio that is significantly higher than
obtained in previous photonic transformer works. Our finding points to a high-performance optical
solution to miniaturizing DC power converters for electronics and improving the electromagnetic
compatibility and quality of electrical power.

Among other remote sensing technologies, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has become firmly established
in the practice of oceanographic research. Despite solid experience in this field, comprehensive
knowledge and interpretation of ocean/sea and vessel wave signatures on radar images are still
very challenging. Many technical parameters and scanning conditions vary for different SAR platforms,
which also imposes some restrictions on the cross-analysis of their respective images. Numerical
simulation of SAR images allows the analysis of many radar imaging parameters including environmental,
ship, or platform related. In this paper, we present a universal simulation framework for SAR imagery
of the sea surface, which includes the superposition of sea-ship waves. This paper is the first attempt
to cover exhaustively all SAR imaging effects for the sea waves and ship wakes scene. The study is
based on well proven concepts: the linear theory of sea surface modeling, Michell thin-ship theory
for Kelvin wake modeling, and ocean SAR imaging theory. We demonstrate the role of two main factors
that affect imaging of both types of waves: (i) SAR parameters and (ii) Hydrodynamic related parameters
such as wind state and Froude number. The SAR parameters include frequency, signal polarization,
mean incidence angle, image resolution, variation by scanning platform (airborne or spaceborne)
of the range-to-velocity (R/V) ratio, and velocity bunching with associated shifting, smearing
and azimuthal cutoff effects. We perform modeling for five wave frequency spectra and four ship
models. We also compare spectra in two aspects: with Cox and Munk's probability density function
(PDF), and with a novel proposed evaluation of ship wake detectability. The simulation results
agree well with SAR imaging theory. The study gives a fuller understanding of radar imaging mechanisms
for sea waves and ship wakes.

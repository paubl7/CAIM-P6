Intensification and poleward expansion of upwelling favourable winds have been predicted as a
response to anthropogenic global climate change and have recently been documented in most Eastern
Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems of the world. To identify how these processes are impacting nearshore
oceanographic habitats and, especially, long term trends of primary productivity in the Humboldt
Upwelling Ecosystem (HUE), we analysed time series of sea level pressure, wind stress, sea surface
and atmospheric surface temperatures, and Chlorophyll-a, as a proxy for primary productivity,
along 26{\deg} - 36{\deg} S. We show that climate induced trends in primary productivity are highly
heterogeneous across the region. On the one hand, the well documented poleward migration of the
South Pacific Anticyclone (SPA) has led to decreased spring upwelling winds in the region between
ca. 30{\deg} and 34{\deg} S, and to their intensification to the south. Decreased winds have produced
slight increases in sea surface temperature and a pronounced and meridionally extensive decrease
in surface Chlorophyll-a in this region of central Chile. To the north of 30{\deg} S, significant
increases in upwelling winds, decreased SST, and enhanced Chlorophyll-a concentration are observed
in the nearshore. We show that this increased in upwelling driven coastal productivity is probably
produced by the increased land-sea pressure gradients (Bakun's effect) that have occurred over
the past two decades north of 30{\deg} S. Thus, climate drivers along the HUE are inducing contrasting
trends in oceanographic conditions and primary productivity, which can have far-reaching consequences
for coastal pelagic and benthic ecosystems and lead to geographic displacements of the major fisheries.

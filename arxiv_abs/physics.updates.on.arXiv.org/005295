In this paper we investigate the resonant electron-plasmon interactions in a drifting electron
gas of arbitrary degeneracy. The kinetic corrected quantum hydrodyanmic model is transformed
into the effective Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson model and driven coupled pseudoforce system is obtained
via the separation of variables from the appropriately linearized system. It is remarked that in
the low phase-speed kinetic regime the characteristic particle-like plasmon branch is profoundly
affected by this correction which is a function of the electron number density and temperature.
We also present an alternative explanation of the quantum wave-particle duality as a direct consequence
of resonant electron-plasmon interaction (electron murmuration). In this picture drifting electrons
are resonantly scattered by spatial electrostatic energy distribution, characterizing them
by the de Broglie's oscillations. The phase-shift and amplitude of excitations in damped driven
pseudoforce system is derived and their variations in terms of normalized chemical potential and
electron temperature is studied. In particular we investigate the kinetic correction effect on
energy dispersion relation in the electron gas in detail. It is revealed that only the low phase-speed
branch of the dispersion curve is significantly affected by the kinetic correction. It is also found
that increase in the electron number density leads to increase in effective mass and consequently
decrease in electron mobility while the increase in the electron temperature has the converse effect.
The kinetic correction also significantly lowers the plasmon conduction band. Current model may
be further elaborated to investigate the beam-plasmon interaction and energy exchange in multispecies
quantum plasmas.

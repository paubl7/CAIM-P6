We develop a landscape-flux framework to investigate observed frequency distributions of vegetation
and the stability of these ecological systems under fluctuations. The frequency distributions
can characterize the population-potential landscape related to the stability of ecological states.
We illustrate the practical utility of this approach by analyzing a forest-savanna model. Savanna,
and Forest states coexist under certain conditions, consistent with past theoretical work and
empirical observations. However, a new Grassland state, unseen in the corresponding deterministic
model, emerges as an alternative quasi-stable state under fluctuations, providing a novel theoretical
basis for the appearance of widespread grasslands in some empirical analyses. The ecological dynamics
are determined by both the population-potential landscape gradient and the steady-state probability
flux. The flux quantifies the net input/output to the ecological system and therefore the degree
of nonequilibriumness. Landscape and flux together determine the transitions between stable
states characterized by dominant paths and switching rates. The intrinsic potential landscape
admits a Lyapunov function, which provides a quantitative measure of global stability. We find
that the average flux, entropy production rate, and free energy have significant changes near bifurcations
under both finite and zero fluctuation. These may provide both dynamical and thermodynamic origins
of the bifurcations. We identified the variances in observed frequency time traces, fluctuations
and time irreversibility as kinematic measures for bifurcations. This new framework opens the
way to characterize ecological systems globally, to uncover how they change among states, and to
quantify the emergence of new quasi-stable states under stochastic fluctuations.

We developed a computational framework for simulating thin fluid flow in narrow interfaces between
contacting solids, which is relevant for a range of engineering, biological and geophysical applications.
The treatment of this problem requires coupling between fluid and solid mechanics equations, further
complicated by contact constraints and potentially complex geometrical features of contacting
surfaces. We developed a monolithic finite-element framework for handling mechanical contact,
thin incompressible viscous flow and fluid-induced tractions on the surface of the solid, suitable
for both one- and two-way coupling approaches. Additionally, we consider the possibility of fluid
entrapment in "pools" delimited by contact patches and its pressurisation following a non-linear
compressibility constitutive law. Furthermore, image analysis algorithms were adapted to identify
the local status of each interface element within the Newton-Raphson loop. First, an application
of the proposed framework for a problem with a model geometry is given, and the robustness is demonstrated
by the residual-wise and status-wise convergence. The full capability of the developed two-way
coupling framework is demonstrated on a problem of a fluid flow in contact interface between a solid
with representative rough surface and a rigid flat. The evolution of the contact pressure, fluid
flow pattern and the morphology of trapped fluid zones until the complete sealing of the interface
is displayed. Additionally, we demonstrated an almost mesh-independent result of a refined post-processing
approach to the real contact-area computation. The developed framework permits not only to study
the evolution of effective properties of contact interfaces, but also to highlight the difference
between one- and two-way coupling approaches and to quantify the effect of multiple trapped fluid
"pools" on the coupled problem.

Ahigh-granularity scintillator calorimeter readout with silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs)
is an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) candidate for experiments at the Circular Electron Positron
Collider (CEPC). A critical design parameter of this ECAL candidate is the dynamic range of the SiPMs.
This study investigates the SiPM dynamic range required for the CEPC scintillator ECAL. A model
is developed on the basis of the operation principles of SiPMs to describe the response of an SiPM
to light pulses within one recovery period by considering the cross-talk effect, photon detection
efficiency, and number of pixels. The response curve of a 10000-pixel SiPM predicted by the model
is consistent with the measured curve within 2% for an incident light pulse of up to 12000 photons.
The intrinsic fluctuations of the SiPM response naturally exist in this model, and the correction
of the saturation effect in the SiPM response is investigated. Monte Carlo (MC) simulation shows
that the algorithm can restore the response linearity of an SiPM for an incident light pulse in which
the number of photons is up to around six times the number of SiPM pixels. The model and correction
program are implemented for full simulation of the ZH production Z->vv, H->yy channel to evaluate
the impact of the SiPM dynamic range of the CEPC scintillator ECAL on the reconstructed Higgs boson
mass and the sensitivity to the Higgs signal in this channel. The results show that the CEPC scintillator
ECAL equipped with no less than 4000 SiPM pixels and operated with a light yield of 20 photon-electrons
per channel for a single minimum ionizing particle can meet the requirements for Higgs boson precision
measurement in the di-photon channel at the CEPC.

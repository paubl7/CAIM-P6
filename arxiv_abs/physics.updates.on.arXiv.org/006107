Fiber reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) materials are extensively used in lightweight applications
due to their high specific strength and other favorable properties including enhanced endurance
and corrosion resistance. However, these materials are inevitably exposed to moisture, which
is known to drastically reduce their mechanical properties caused by moisture absorption and often
accompanied with plasticization, weight gain, hygrothermal swelling, and de-bonding between
fiber and matrix. Hence, it is vital to understand moisture diffusion mechanics into FRPCs. The
presence of fibers, especially impermeable like Carbon fibers, introduce tortuous moisture diffusion
pathways through polymer matrix. In this paper, we elucidate the impact of fiber packing and morphology
on moisture diffusion in FRPC materials. Computational models are developed within a finite element
framework to evaluate moisture kinetics in impermeable FRPCs. We introduce a tortuosity factor
for measuring the extent of deviation in moisture diffusion pathways due to impermeable fiber reinforcements.
Two-dimensional micromechanical models are analyzed with varying fiber volume fractions, spatial
distributions and morphology to elucidate the influence of internal micromechanical fiber architectures
on tortuous diffusion pathways and corresponding diffusivities. Finally, a relationship between
tortuosity and diffusivity is established such that diffusivity can be calculated using tortuosity
for a given micro-architecture. Tortuosity can be easily calculated for a given architecture by
solving steady state diffusion governing equations, whereas time-dependent transient diffusion
equations need to be solved for calculating moisture diffusivity. Hence, tortuosity, instead
of diffusivity, can be used in future composites designs, multi-scale analyses, and optimization
for enabling robust structures in moisture environments.

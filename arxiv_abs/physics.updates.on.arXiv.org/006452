Particle agglutination assays are widely adapted immunological tests that are based on antigen-antibody
interactions. Antibody-coated microscopic particles are mixed with a test sample that potentially
contains the target antigen, as a result of which the particles form clusters, with a size that is
a function of the antigen concentration and the reaction time. Here, we present a quantitative particle
agglutination assay that combines mobile lens-free microscopy and deep learning for rapidly measuring
the concentration of a target analyte; as its proof-of-concept, we demonstrate high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) testing using human serum samples. A dual-channel capillary lateral
flow device is designed to host the agglutination reaction using 4 uL of serum sample with a material
cost of 1.79 cents per test. A mobile lens-free microscope records time-lapsed inline holograms
of the lateral flow device, monitoring the agglutination process over 3 min. These captured holograms
are processed, and at each frame the number and area of the particle clusters are automatically extracted
and fed into shallow neural networks to predict the CRP concentration. 189 measurements using 88
unique patient serum samples were utilized to train, validate and blindly test our platform, which
matched the corresponding ground truth concentrations in the hs-CRP range (0-10 ug/mL) with an
R2 value of 0.912. This computational sensing platform was also able to successfully differentiate
very high CRP concentrations (e.g., >10-500 ug/mL) from the hs-CRP range. This mobile, cost-effective
and quantitative particle agglutination assay can be useful for various point-of-care sensing
needs and global health related applications.

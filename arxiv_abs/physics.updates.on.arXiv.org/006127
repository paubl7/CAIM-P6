One of the fundamental open questions in plasma physics is the role of non-thermal particles distributions
in poorly collisional plasma environments, a system commonly found throughout the Universe, e.g.
the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere correspond to natural plasma physics laboratories
in which turbulent phenomena can be studied. Our study perspective is born from the method of Horizontal
Visibility Graph (HVG) that has been developed in the last years to analyze time series avoiding
the tedium and the high computational cost that other methods offer. Here we build a complex network
based on directed HVG technique applied to magnetic field fluctuations time series obtained from
Particle In Cell (PIC) simulations of a magnetized collisionless plasma to distinguish the degree
distributions and calculate the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) as a measure of relative entropy
of data sets produced by processes that are not in equilibrium. First, we analyze the connectivity
probability distribution for the undirected version of HVG finding how the Kappa distribution
for low values of $\kappa$ tends to be an uncorrelated time series, while the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution shows a correlated stochastic processes behavior. Then, we investigate the degree
of temporary irreversibility of magnetic fluctuations self-generated by the plasma, comparing
the case of a thermal plasma (described by a Maxwell-Botzmann velocity distribution function)
with non-thermal Kappa distributions. We have shown that the KLD associated to the HVG is able to
distinguish the level of reversibility associated to the thermal equilibrium in the plasma because
the dissipative degree of the system increases as the value of $\kappa$ parameter decreases and
the distribution function departs from the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium.

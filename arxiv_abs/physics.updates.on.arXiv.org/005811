We present an optimization-based method to efficiently calculate accurate nonlinear models of
Taylor vortex flow. We use the resolvent formulation of McKeon & Sharma (2010) to model these Taylor
vortex solutions by treating the nonlinearity not as an inherent part of the governing equations
but rather as a triadic constraint which must be satisfied by the model solution. We exploit the low
rank linear dynamics of the system to calculate an efficient basis for our solution, the coefficients
of which are then calculated through an optimization problem where the cost function to be minimized
is the triadic consistency of the solution with itself as well as with the input mean flow. Our approach
constitutes, what is to the best of our knowledge, the first fully nonlinear and self-sustaining,
resolvent-based model described in the literature. We compare our results to direct numerical
simulation of Taylor Couette flow at up to five times the critical Reynolds number, and show that
our model accurately captures the structure of the flow. Additionally, we find that as the Reynolds
number increases the flow undergoes a fundamental transition from a classical weakly nonlinear
regime, where the forcing cascade is strictly down scale, to a fully nonlinear regime characterized
by the emergence of an inverse (up scale) forcing cascade. Triadic contributions from the inverse
and traditional cascade destructively interfere implying that the accurate modeling of a certain
Fourier mode requires knowledge of its immediate harmonic and sub-harmonic. We show analytically
that this finding is a direct consequence of the structure of the quadratic nonlinearity of the governing
equations formulated in Fourier space. Finally, we show that using our model solution as an initial
condition to a higher Reynolds number DNS significantly reduces the time to convergence.

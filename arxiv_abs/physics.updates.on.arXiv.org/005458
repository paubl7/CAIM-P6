The second paper of this series presents two robust entropy stable shock-capturing methods for
discontinuous Galerkin spectral element (DGSEM) discretizations of the compressible magneto-hydrodynamics
(MHD) equations. Specifically, we use the resistive GLM-MHD equations, which include a divergence
cleaning mechanism that is based on a generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM). For the continuous
entropy analysis to hold, and due to the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field, the GLM-MHD
system requires the use of non-conservative terms, which need special treatment. Hennemann et
al. [DOI:10.1016/j.jcp.2020.109935] recently presented an entropy stable shock-capturing
strategy for DGSEM discretizations of the Euler equations that blends the DGSEM scheme with a subcell
first-order finite volume (FV) method. Our first contribution is the extension of the method of
Hennemann et al. to systems with non-conservative terms, such as the GLM-MHD equations. In our approach,
the advective and non-conservative terms of the equations are discretized with a hybrid FV/DGSEM
scheme, whereas the visco-resistive terms are discretized only with the high-order DGSEM method.
We prove that the extended method is entropy stable on three-dimensional unstructured curvilinear
meshes. Our second contribution is the derivation and analysis of a second entropy stable shock-capturing
method that provides enhanced resolution by using a subcell reconstruction procedure that is carefully
built to ensure entropy stability. We provide a numerical verification of the properties of the
hybrid FV/DGSEM schemes on curvilinear meshes and show their robustness and accuracy with common
benchmark cases, such as the Orszag-Tang vortex and the GEM reconnection challenge. Finally, we
simulate a space physics application: the interaction of Jupiter's magnetic field with the plasma
torus generated by the moon Io.

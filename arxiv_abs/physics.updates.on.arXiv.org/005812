Large-scale modelling of three-dimensional controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) surveys
used to be feasible only for large companies and research consortia. This has changed over the last
few years, and today there exists a selection of different open-source codes. Using four different
codes in the Python ecosystem, we perform simulations for increasingly complex models. We first
verify the computed fields with semi-analytical solutions for a simple layered model. Then we validate
the responses of a more complex block model by comparing results obtained from each code. Finally
we compare the responses of a real world model with results from the industry. These validations
show that the open-source codes are able to compute comparable CSEM responses for challenging,
large-scale models. Our comparison includes finite-element and finite-volume codes using structured
rectilinear and octree meshes as well as unstructured tetrahedral meshes. Accurate responses
can be obtained independently of the chosen method and the chosen mesh type. The runtime and memory
requirements vary greatly based on the choice of iterative or direct solvers. However, we have found
that much more time was spent on designing the mesh and setting up the simulations than running the
actual computation. The challenging task is, irrespective of the chosen code, to appropriately
discretize the model. We provide three models, each with their corresponding discretization and
responses of four codes, which can be used for validation of new and existing codes. The collaboration
of four code maintainers trying to achieve the same task brought in the end all four codes a significant
step further. This includes improved meshing and interpolation capabilities, resulting in shorter
runtimes for the same accuracy.

Chaos is ubiquitous in physical systems. The associated sensitivity to initial conditions is a
significant obstacle in forecasting the weather and other geophysical fluid flows. Data assimilation
is the process whereby the uncertainty in initial conditions is reduced by the astute combination
of model predictions and real-time data. This chapter reviews recent findings from investigations
on the impact of chaos on data assimilation methods: for the Kalman filter and smoother in linear
systems, analytic results are derived; for their ensemble-based versions and nonlinear dynamics,
numerical results provide insights. The focus is on characterising the asymptotic statistics
of the Bayesian posterior in terms of the dynamical instabilities, differentiating between deterministic
and stochastic dynamics. We also present two novel results. Firstly, we study the functioning of
the ensemble Kalman filter in the context of a chaotic, coupled, atmosphere-ocean model with a quasi-degenerate
spectrum of Lyapunov exponents, showing the importance of having sufficient ensemble members
to track all of the near-null modes. Secondly, for the fully non-Gaussian method of the particle
filter, numerical experiments are conducted to test whether the curse of dimensionality can be
mitigated by discarding observations in the directions of little dynamical growth of uncertainty.
The results refute this option, most likely because the particles already embody this information
on the chaotic system. The results also suggest that it is the rank of the unstable-neutral subspace
of the dynamics, and not that of the observation operator, that determines the required number of
particles. We finally discuss how knowledge of the random attractor can play a role in the development
of future data assimilation schemes for chaotic multiscale systems with large scale separation.

A database of DIII-D plasmas without ELMs compares the operating space and plasma performance of
stationary no-ELM regimes: RMP-ELM suppression, QH-mode, I-mode, EDA H-mode, L-mode, and negative
triangularity L-mode (Neg-D). Operational space is documented in terms of engineering and physics
parameters, revealing divergent constraints. Some operational space discriminants (such as
pedestal collisionality) are well known, while others, such as low torque & safety factor, or high
power & density, are less commonly emphasized. Normalized performance (confinement quality and
normalized pressure) also discriminate the no-ELM regimes and favor the regimes tolerant to power
in DIII-D: RMP, QH, and Neg-D. Absolute performance (triple product <p>$\tau$) also discriminates
no-ELM regimes and is found to rise linearly with IaB and also benefits from tolerance to power. The
highest normalized performance using the metric <p>$\tau$/IaB is found in QH and RMP regimes. Though
comparable QH and RMP performance is found, the pedestal pressure (p_ped) is very different. p_ped
in RMP plasmas is relatively low, and the best performance is found with a high core <p> fraction alongside
high core rotation, consistent with an ExB shear confinement enhancement. p_ped of QH plasmas is
significantly higher than RMP, and QH performance does not correlate with core rotation. However,
the highest QH p_ped are found with high carbon fraction. While normalized performance of Neg-D
plasmas is comparable to QH and RMP plasmas, the absolute confinement of Neg-D is lower, owing to
low elongation and low p_ped achieved thus far. Only the EDA-H, Neg-D, and L-mode scenarios have
approached divertor-compatible high separatrix density conditions, with Neg-D preserving the
highest performance owing to its compatibility with both high power and density.

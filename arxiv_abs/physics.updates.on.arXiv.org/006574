In the present study, the multiphase volume distribution problem, where there can be an arbitrary
number of phases, is addressed using a consistent and conservative volume distribution algorithm.
The proposed algorithm satisfies the summation constraint, the conservation constraint, and
the \textit{consistency of reduction}. The first application of the volume distribution algorithm
is to determine the Lagrange multipliers in multiphase Phase-Field models that enforce the mass
conservation, and a multiphase conservative Allen-Cahn model that satisfies the \textit{consistency
of reduction} is developed. A corresponding consistent and conservative numerical scheme is developed
for the model. The multiphase conservative Allen-Cahn model has a better ability than the multiphase
Cahn-Hilliard model to preserve under-resolved structures. The second application is to develop
a numerical procedure, called the boundedness mapping, to map the order parameters, obtained numerically
from a multiphase model, into their physical interval, and at the same time to preserve the physical
properties of the order parameters. Along with the consistent and conservative schemes for the
multiphase Phase-Field models, the numerical solutions of the order parameters are reduction
consistent, conservative, and bounded, which are theoretically analyzed and numerically validated.
Then, the multiphase Phase-Field models are coupled with the momentum equation by satisfying the
\textit{consistency of mass conservation} and the \textit{consistency of mass and momentum transport},
thanks to the consistent formulation. It is demonstrated that the proposed model and scheme converge
to the sharp-interface solution and are capable of capturing the complicated multiphase dynamics
even when there is a large density and/or viscosity ratio.

We present a statistical analysis of more than two thousand bipolar electrostatic solitary waves
(ESW) collected from ten quasi-perpendicular Earth's bow shock crossings by Magnetospheric Multiscale
spacecraft. We developed and implemented a correction procedure for reconstruction of actual
electric fields, velocities, and other properties of ESW from measurements, whose spatial scales
are typically comparable with or smaller than spatial distance between voltage-sensitive probes.
We determined the optimal ratio between frequency response factors of axial and spin plane antennas
to be around 1.65/1.8. We found that more than 95\% of the ESW in the Earth's bow shock are of negative
polarity and present an in depth analysis of properties of these ESW. They have spatial scales of
about 10--100 m that is within a range of $\lambda_{D}$ to $10\lambda_{D}$, amplitudes typically
below a few Volts that is below 0.1 of local electron temperature, and velocities below a few hundreds
km/s in spacecraft and plasma rest frames that is on the order of local ion-acoustic speed. The spatial
scales of ESW are distinctly correlated with local Debye length $\lambda_{D}$. ESW with amplitudes
of 5--30 V or 0.1--0.3 Te have the occurrence rate of a few percent. The ESW have electric fields generally
oblique to local magnetic field and propagate highly oblique to shock normal ${\bf N}$; more than
80\% of ESW propagate within 30$^{\circ}$ of the shock plane. In the shock plane, ESW typically propagate
within a few tens of degrees of local magnetic field projection ${\bf B}_{\rm LM}$ onto the shock
plane and preferentially opposite to ${\bf N}\times {\bf B}_{\rm LM}$. We argue that the ESW of negative
polarity are ion phase space holes produced in a nonlinear stage of ion-ion ion-streaming instabilities.
We estimated lifetimes of the ion holes to be 10--100 ms, or 1--10 km in terms of spatial distance.

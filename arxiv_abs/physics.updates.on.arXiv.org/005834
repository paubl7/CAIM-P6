A subset of QuantISED Sensor PIs met virtually on May 26, 2020 to discuss a response to a charge by the
DOE Office of High Energy Physics. In this document, we summarize the QuantISED sensor community
discussion, including a consideration of HEP science enabled by quantum sensors, describing the
distinction between Quantum 1.0 and Quantum 2.0, and discussing synergies/complementarity with
the new DOE NQI centers and with research supported by other SC offices. Quantum 2.0 advances in sensor
technology offer many opportunities and new approaches for HEP experiments. The DOE HEP QuantISED
program could support a portfolio of small experiments based on these advances. QuantISED experiments
could use sensor technologies that exemplify Quantum 2.0 breakthroughs. They would strive to achieve
new HEP science results, while possibly spinning off other domain science applications or serving
as pathfinders for future HEP science targets. QuantISED experiments should be led by a DOE laboratory,
to take advantage of laboratory technical resources, infrastructure, and expertise in the safe
and efficient construction, operation, and review of experiments. The QuantISED PIs emphasized
that the quest for HEP science results under the QuantISED program is distinct from the ongoing DOE
HEP programs on the energy, intensity, and cosmic frontiers. There is robust evidence for the existence
of particles and phenomena beyond the Standard Model, including dark matter, dark energy, quantum
gravity, and new physics responsible for neutrino masses, cosmic inflation, and the cosmic preference
for matter over antimatter. Where is this physics and how do we find it? The QuantISED program can
exploit new capabilities provided by quantum technology to probe these kinds of science questions
in new ways and over a broader range of science parameters than can be achieved with conventional
techniques.

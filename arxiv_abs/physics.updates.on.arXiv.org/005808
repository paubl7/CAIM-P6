We have considered a shock wave as a surface of discontinuity and computed the entropy production
using non-equilibrium thermodynamics for surfaces. The results from this method, which we call
the "Gibbs excess method" (GEM), were compared with results from three alternative methods, all
based on the entropy balance in the shock front region, but with different assumptions about local
equilibrium. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations were used to simulate a thermal
blast in a one-component gas consisting of particles interacting with the Lennard-Jones/spline
potential. This provided data for the theoretical analysis. Two cases were studied, a weak shock
with Mach number $M \approx 2$ and a strong shock with $M \approx 6$ and with a Prandtl number of the
gas $Pr \approx 1.4$ in both cases. The four theoretical methods gave consistent results for the
time-dependent surface excess entropy production for both Mach numbers. The internal energy was
found to deviate only slightly from equilibrium values in the shock front. The pressure profile
was found to be consistent with the Navier-Stokes equations. The entropy production in the weak
and strong shocks were approximately proportional to the square of the Mach number and decayed with
time at approximately the same relative rate. In both cases, some 97 \% of the total entropy production
in the gas occurred in the shock wave. The GEM showed that most of the shock's kinetic energy was converted
reversibly into enthalpy and entropy, and a small amount was dissipated as produced entropy. The
shock waves traveled at almost constant speed and we found that the overpressure determined from
NEMD simulations agreed well with the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for steady-state shocks.

Silicon photonics is destined to revolutionize technological areas, such as short-distance data
transfer and sensing applications by combining the benefits of integrated optics with the assertiveness
of silicon-based microelectronics. However, the lack of practical and low-cost silicon-based
monolithic light sources such as light-emitting diodes and, in particular, lasers is the main bottleneck
for silicon photonics to become the key technology of the 21st century. After briefly reviewing
the state of the art regarding silicon-based light-emitters, we discuss the challenges and benefits
of a highly flexible approach: The epitaxial incorporation of group-IV nanostructures into crystalline
silicon. We argue that a paradigm change for group-IV quantum dots (QDs) can be achieved by the intentional
incorporation of extended point defects inside the QDs upon low energy ion implantation. The superior
light-emission properties from such defect-enhanced quantum dots (DEQDs), our present understanding
of their structural formation and light-emission mechanisms will be discussed. We will show that
useful electrically-driven devices, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can be fabricated employing
optically active DEQD-material. These LEDs exhibit exceptional temperature-stability of their
light emission properties even up to 100{\deg}C, unprecedented for purely group-IV-based optoelectronic
devices. Thereafter, we will assess the superior temperature stability of the structural properties
of DEQDs upon thermal annealing, the scalability of the light-emission with the DEQD density and
passivation schemes to further improve the optical properties. The chapter ends with a discussion
of future research directions that will spark the development of this exciting field even further.

How simple organic matter appeared on Earth and the processes by which it transformed into more evolved
organic compounds, which ultimately led to the emergence of life, is still an open topic. Different
scenarios have been proposed, the main one assumes that simple organic compounds were synthesized,
either in the gas phase or on the surfaces of dust grains, during the process of star formation, and
were incorporated into larger bodies in the protoplanetary disk. Transformation of these simple
organic compounds in more complex forms is still a matter of debate. Recent discoveries point out
to catalytic properties of dust grains present in the early stellar envelope, which can nowadays
be found in the form of chondrites. The huge infall of chondritic meteorites during the early periods
of Earth suggests that the same reactions could have taken place in certain environments of the Earth
surface, with conditions more favorable for organic synthesis. This work attempts the synthesis
of simple organic molecules, such as hydrocarbons and alcohols, via Fischer-Tropsch Type reactions
supported by different chondritic materials under early-Earth conditions, to investigate if
organic synthesis can likely occur in this environment and which are the differences in selectivity
when using different types of chondrites. Fischer-Tropsch-type reactions are investigated from
mixtures of CO and H2 at 1 atm of pressure on the surfaces of different chondritic samples. The different
products obtained are analyzed in situ by gas chromatography. Different Fischer-Tropsch reaction
products are obtained in quantitative amounts. The formation of alkanes and alkenes being the main
processes. Formation of alcohols also takes place in a smaller amount. Other secondary products
were obtained in a qualitative way.

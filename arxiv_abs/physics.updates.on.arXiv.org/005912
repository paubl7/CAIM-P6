We revise the steady vortex surface theory following the recent finding of asymmetric vortex sheets
(AM,2021). These surfaces avoid the \KH{} instability by adjusting their discontinuity and its
shape. The vorticity is confined to the sheet only in an exceptional case considered long ago by Burgers
and Townsend, where it decays as a Gaussian on both sides of the sheet. In generic asymmetric vortex
sheets (Shariff,2021), vorticity leaks on one side or another, making such sheets inadequate for
vortex sheet statistics and anomalous dissipation. This concludes that vorticity in a turbulent
flow collapses along the surface, where the strain tensor's determinant vanishes. The generic
Euler vortex sheet solution matches the planar Burgers-Townsend solution of the Navier-Stokes
equation in the local boundary layer; otherwise, it matches the asymmetric vortex sheet solution
with leaking vorticity. The most important qualitative observation is that an inequality needed
for this solution's stability breaks the time reversibility of the Euler dynamics. We interpret
this as dynamic irreversibility, as it does not involve viscosity and is formulated in terms of the
potential Euler flow. We investigate the equations for these Confined Vortex Surfaces and exactly
reduce them to a minimization of a vortex sheet Hamiltonian on a certain subset of two-dimensional
variables. The axially symmetric surface corresponds to the one-dimensional variational problem,
which we solved on a computer with \Mathematica{}. The irreversible turbulent statistics emerge
due to the Gaussian distribution of the symmetric traceless matrix, describing the strain's boundary
value at infinity, with a confined vorticity inequality imposed.

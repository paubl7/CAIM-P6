Of particular relevance to energy storage, electrochemistry and catalysis, ionic and dipolar
liquids display a wealth of unexpected fundamental behaviors - in particular in confinement. Beyond
now well-documented adsorption, overscreening and crowding effects, recent experiments have
highlighted novel phenomena such as unconventional screening and the impact of the electronic
nature - metallic versus insulating - of the confining surface on wetting/phase transitions. Such
behaviors, which challenge existing theoretical and numerical modeling frameworks, point to
the need for new powerful tools to embrace the properties of confined ionic/dipolar liquids. Here,
we introduce a novel atom-scale approach which allows for a versatile description of electronic
screening while capturing all molecular aspects inherent to molecular fluids in nanoconfined/interfacial
environments. While state of the art molecular simulation strategies only consider perfect metal
or insulator surfaces, we build on the Thomas-Fermi formalism for electronic screening to develop
an effective approach that allows dealing with any imperfect metal between these asymptotes. The
core of our approach is to describe electrostatic interactions within the metal through the behavior
of a `virtual' Thomas-Fermi fluid of charged particles, whose Debye length sets the Thomas-Fermi
screening length $\lambda$ in the metal. This easy-to-implement molecular method captures the
electrostatic interaction decay upon varying $\lambda$ from insulator to perfect metal conditions,
while describing very accurately the capacitance behavior - and hence the electrochemical properties
- of the metallic confining medium. By applying this strategy to a nanoconfined ionic liquid, we
demonstrate an unprecedented wetting transition upon switching the confining medium from insulating
to metallic.

Knowledge of x-ray attenuation is essential for developing and evaluating x-ray imaging technologies.
In mammography, measurement of breast density, dose estimation, and differentiation between
cysts and solid tumours are example applications requiring accurate data on tissue attenuation.
Published attenuation data are, however, sparse and cover a relatively wide range. To supplement
available data we have previously measured the attenuation of cyst fluid and solid lesions using
photon-counting spectral mammography. The present study aims to measure the attenuation of normal
adipose and glandular tissue, and to measure the effect of formalin fixation, a major uncertainty
in published data. A total of 27 tumour specimens, seven fibro-glandular tissue specimens, and
15 adipose tissue specimens were included. Spectral (energy-resolved) images of the samples were
acquired and the image signal was mapped to equivalent thicknesses of two known reference materials,
from which x-ray attenuation as a function of energy can be derived. The spread in attenuation between
samples was relatively large, partly because of natural variation. The variation of malignant
and glandular tissue was similar, whereas that of adipose tissue was lower. Formalin fixation slightly
altered the attenuation of malignant and glandular tissue, whereas the attenuation of adipose
tissue was not significantly affected. The difference in attenuation between fresh tumour tissue
and cyst fluid was smaller than has previously been measured for fixed tissue, but the difference
was still significant and discrimination of these two tissue types is still possible. The difference
between glandular and malignant tissue was close-to significant; it is reasonable to expect a significant
difference with a larger set of samples. [cropped]

We investigate numerically and theoretically the conditions leading to soliton ejection stimulated
through the scattering of bright solitons by modulated reflectionless potential wells. Such potential
wells allow for the possibility of controlled ejection of solitons with significantly high speeds.
At the outset, we describe the scattering setup and characterise the soliton ejection in terms of
the different parameters of the system. Then, we formulate a theoretical model revealing the underlying
physics of soliton ejection. The model is based on energy and norm exchange between the incident
soliton and a stable trapped mode corresponding to an exact solution of the governing nonlinear
Schrodinger equation. Remarkably, stationary solitons can lead to high-speed soliton ejection
where part of the nonlinear interaction energy transforms to translational kinetic energy of the
ejected soliton. Our investigation shows that soliton ejection always occurs whenever the incident
soliton norm is greater than that of the trapped mode while their energy is almost the same. Once the
incident soliton is trapped, the excess in norm turns to an ejected soliton in addition to a small
amount of radiation that share translational kinetic energy. We found that higher ejection speeds
are obtained with multi-node trapped modes that have larger binding energy. Simultaneous two-soliton
ejection has been also induced by two solitons scattering with the potential from both of its sides.
An ejection speed almost twice as that of single soliton ejection was obtained. Ejection outcome
and ejection speed turn out to be sensitive to the relative phase between the two incoming solitons,
which suggests a tool for soliton phase interferometry.

Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 has significantly affected the lives of people around the world.
Towards the end of 2020, several COVID-19 vaccine candidates with relatively high efficacy have
been reported in the final phase of clinical trials. Vaccines have been considered as critical tools
for opening up social and economic activities, thereby lessening the impact of this disease on the
society. This paper presents a simulation of COVID-19 spread using modified Susceptible-Infected-Removed
(SIR) model under vaccine intervention in several localities of Malaysia, i.e. those cities or
states with high relatively COVID-19 cases such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Sabah, and Sarawak. The
results show that at different vaccine efficacy levels (0.75, 0.85, and 0.95), the curves of active
infection vary slightly, indicating that vaccines with efficacy above 0.75 would produce the herd
immunity required to level the curves. In addition, disparity is significant between implementing
or not implementing a vaccination program. Simulation results also show that lowering the reproduction
number, R0 is necessary to keep the infection curve flat despite vaccination. This is due to the assumption
that vaccination is mostly carried out gradually at the assumed fixed rate. The statement is based
on our simulation results with two values of R0: 1.1 and 1.2, indicative of reduction of R0 by social
distancing. The lower R0 shows a smaller peak amplitude about half the value simulated with R0=1.2.
In conclusion, the simulation model suggests a two-pronged strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic
in Malaysia: vaccination and compliance with standard operating procedure issued by the World
Health Organization (e.g. social distancing).

During the course of an epidemic, one of the most challenging tasks for authorities is to decide what
kind of restrictive measures to introduce and when these should be enforced. In order to take informed
decisions in a fully rational manner, the onset of a critical regime, characterized by an exponential
growth of the contagion, must be identified as quickly as possible. Providing rigorous quantitative
tools to detect such an onset represents an important contribution from the scientific community
to proactively support the political decision makers. In this paper, leveraging the quickest detection
theory, we propose a mathematical model of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution and develop decision
tools to rapidly detect the passage from a controlled regime to a critical one. A new sequential test
-- referred to as MAST (mean-agnostic sequential test) -- is presented, and demonstrated on publicly
available COVID-19 infection data from different countries. Then, the performance of MAST is investigated
for the second pandemic wave, showing an effective trade-off between average decision delay $\Delta$
and risk $R$, where $R$ is inversely proportional to the time required to declare the need to take
unnecessary restrictive measures. We find that all the countries share the same behaviour in terms
of quickest detection, specifically the risk scales exponentially with the delay, $R \sim \exp{(-\omega
\Delta)}$, where $\omega$ depends on the specific nation. For a reasonably small risk level, say,
one possibility in ten thousand (i.e., unmotivated implementation of countermeasures every 27~years,
on the average), the proposed algorithm detects the onset of the critical regime with delay between
a few days to three weeks, much earlier than when the exponential growth becomes evident.

The Christy Gadget is the informal name for the plutonium device detonated in the Trinity test on
July 16, 1945. In September 1944, Robert Christy, working in the theoretical implosion group, proposed
a novel concept that altered the design of the nuclear core in Fat Man. While scientists originally
intended to use a hollow sphere of plutonium, this design entailed substantial risk, due to the likelihood
of asymmetries resulting from implosion. Christy proposed changing the design to a solid sphere
of plutonium with a modulated neutron source, and the design was eventually adopted, tested at Trinity,
and used in the attack on Nagasaki. While there is no question regarding the important role that Christy
played in demonstrating its feasibility as a reliable design, there is a debate as to who initially
proposed the idea; though most sources have attributed this invention to Christy, some historical
sources have attributed credit to Christy's group leader, Rudolf Peierls, or indeed other scientists.
This paper seeks to outline and resolve this dispute. We present new unclassified evidence extracted
from previously unavailable sources (to unclassified audiences) from the National Security Research
Center archives at Los Alamos National Laboratory. This evidence consists of 1945-1946 patent
documentation, oral history interview tapes of Christy and Peierls, and monthly 1944 progress
reports from the Theoretical Division. Though Christy and Peierls share joint credit on the patent,
both Christy's and Peierls' words and writings, together with sources from Hans Bethe and Edward
Teller, support the traditional view that Christy was indeed the originator of the idea. While Christy
does deserve the majority of the credit for the invention and design, we acknowledge the important
role Peierls and von Neumann played in its development.

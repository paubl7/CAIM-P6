This work constructs, analyzes, and simulates a new compartmental SEIR-type model for the dynamics
and potential control of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The novelty in this work is two-fold. First,
the population is divided according to its compliance with disease control directives (lockdown,
shelter-in-place, masks/face coverings, physical distancing, etc.) into those who fully comply
and those who follow the directives partially, or are necessarily mobile (such as medical staff).
This split, indirectly, reflects on the quality and consistency of these measures. This allows
the assessment of the overall effectiveness of the control measures and the impact of their relaxing
or tightening on the disease spread. Second, the adequate contact rate, which directly affects
the infection rate, is one of the model unknowns, as it keeps track of the changes in the population
behavior and the effectiveness of various disease treatment modalities via a differential inclusion.
Existence, uniqueness and positivity results are proved using a nonstandard convex analysis-based
approach. As a case study, the pandemic outbreak in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) is simulated.
The model parameters were found by minimizing the deviation of the model prediction from the reported
data over the first 100 days of the pandemic in South Korea.The simulations show that the model captures
accurately the pandemic dynamics in the subsequent 75 days, which provides confidence in the model
predictions and its future use. In particular, the model predicts that about 40% of the infections
were not documented, which implies that asymptomatic infections contribute silently but substantially
to the spread of the disease indicating that more widespread asymptomatic testing is necessary.

Four different applications of spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD): low-rank reconstruction,
denoising, frequency-time analysis, and prewhitening are demonstrated on large-eddy simulation
data of a turbulent jet. SPOD-based low-rank reconstruction can be performed by direct inversion
of a truncated SPOD. This spectral inversion problem, however, is ambiguous since SPOD relies on
spectral estimation. We demonstrate SPOD-based flow field reconstruction using direct inversion
of the SPOD algorithm (frequency-domain approach) and propose an alternative approach based on
projection of the time series data onto the modes (time-domain approach). While the SPOD optimally
represents the flow in a statistical sense, the time-domain approach seeks an optimal reconstruction
of each instantaneous flow field. We further propose a SPOD-based denoising strategy that is based
on hard-thresholding of the SPOD eigenvalues. The proposed strategy achieves significant noise
reduction while facilitating drastic data compression. In contrast to standard methods of frequency-time
analysis such as wavelet transform, a proposed SPOD-based approach yields a spectrogram that characterizes
the temporal evolution of spatially coherent flow structures. In the frequency-domain, time-varying
expansion coefficients can be obtained by basing the SPOD on a sliding window. This approach, however,
is computationally intractable, and an alternative strategy based on convolution in the time-domain
is presented. When applied to the turbulent jet data, SPOD-based frequency-time analysis reveals
that the intermittent occurrence of large-scale coherent structures is directly associated with
high-energy events. This work suggests that the time-domain approach is preferable for low-rank
reconstruction of individual snapshots, and the frequency-domain approach for denoising and
frequency-time analysis.

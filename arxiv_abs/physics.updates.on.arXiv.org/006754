A multi-species magnetized collisional nonthermal plasma system containing inertial ion species,
non-inertial electron species following nonthermal $\kappa-$ distribution, and immobile dust
particles, is considered to examine the characteristics of the dissipative dust-ion-acoustic
(DIA) soliton modes, \textbf{theoretically and parametrically}. The electrostatic solitary
modes are found to be associated with the low frequency dissipative dust-ion-acoustic solitary
waves (DIASWs). The ion-neutral collision is taken into account, and the influence of ion-neutral
collisional effects on the dynamics of dissipative DIASWs is investigated. It is reported that
most of the plasma mediums in space and laboratory are far from thermal equilibrium, and the particles
in such plasma systems are well fitted via the $\kappa-$nonthermal distribution than via the thermal
Maxwellian distribution. The reductive perturbation approach is adopted to derive the damped
KdV (dKdV) equation, and the solitary wave solution of the dKdV equation is derived via the tangent
hyperbolic method to analyze the basic features (amplitude, width, speed, time evolution, etc.)
of dissipative DIASWs. The propagation nature and also the basic features of dissipative DIASWs
are seen to influence significantly due to the variation of the plasma configuration parameters
and also due to the variation of the supethermality index $\kappa$ in the considered plasma system.
The implication of the results of this study could be useful for better understanding the electrostatic
localized disturbances, in the ion length and time scale, in space and experimental dusty plasmas,
where the presence of excess energetic electrons and ion-neutral collisional damping are accountable.

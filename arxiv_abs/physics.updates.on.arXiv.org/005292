Vertical convection is investigated using direct numerical simulations over a wide range of Rayleigh
numbers $10^7\le Ra\le10^{14}$ with fixed Prandtl number $Pr=10$, in a two-dimensional convection
cell with unit aspect ratio. It is found that the dependence of the mean vertical centre temperature
gradient $S$ on $Ra$ shows three different regimes: In regime I ($Ra \lesssim 5\times10^{10}$),
$S$ is almost independent of $Ra$; In the newly identified regime II ($5\times10^{10} \lesssim
Ra \lesssim 10^{13}$), $S$ first increases with increasing $Ra$ (regime ${\rm{II}}_a$), reaches
its maximum and then decreases again (regime ${\rm{II}}_b$); In regime III ($Ra\gtrsim10^{13}$),
$S$ again becomes only weakly dependent on $Ra$, being slightly smaller than in regime I. The transitions
between diffeereent regimes are discussd. In the three different regimes, significantly different
flow organizations are identified: In regime I and regime ${\rm{II}}_a$, the location of the maximal
horizontal velocity is close to the top and bottom walls; However, in regime ${\rm{II}}_b$ and regime
III, banded zonal flow structures develop and the maximal horizontal velocity now is in the bulk
region. The different flow organizations in the three regimes are also reflected in the scaling
exponents in the effective power law scalings $Nu\sim Ra^\beta$ and $Re\sim Ra^\gamma$. In regime
I, the fitted scaling exponents ($\beta\approx0.26$ and $\gamma\approx0.51$) are in excellent
agreement with the theoretical predication of $\beta=1/4$ and $\gamma=1/2$ for laminar VC (Shishkina,
{\it{Phys. Rev. E.}} 2016, 93, 051102). However, in regimes II and III, $\beta$ increases to a value
close to 1/3 and $\gamma$ decreases to a value close to 4/9. The stronger $Ra$ dependence of $Nu$ is
related to the ejection of plumes and larger local heat flux at the walls.

On-demand ridepooling (ODRP) can become a powerful alternative to reduce congestion and emissions,
if it attracts private car users rather than from public transport. Therefore, it is crucial to identify
the strategic phenomena that determine when ODRP systems can run efficiently, and understand when
they could be integrated into a public transport network. In this paper, we analyze the performance
of an ODRP system operated in a zone covered by a single public transport line. The fleet of low-capacity
vehicles is endogenously adapted to the demand. Considering both users' and operators' costs,
we identify two sources of scale economies: when demand grows, the average cost is reduced due to
an equivalent of the Mohring Effect (that is present in public transport), and due to matching the
users in more compatible groups when they are assigned to the vehicles, which we call Better-matching
Effect. A counter-balance force, called Flex-route Effect, is observed when the vehicle loads
increase and users face longer detours. We find a specific demand range in which this last effect
dominates the others, imposing diseconomies of scale when only users' costs are considered. Such
a phenomenon is not observed in public transport systems based on fixed routes. However, when considering
both users' and operators' costs, scale economies prevail. We compare the ODRP results against
public transport, for a feeder line and a circular line with homogeneous demand. We show that ODRP
is more competitive when users share a common destination (the feeder line) and when the demand is
low, although scale effects suggest that ODRP can also play a role when the demand is high. Relaxing
door-to-door vehicle requirements to allow short walks, is shown to be crucial for ODRP to become
a viable alternative for both human-driven and automated vehicles, if the ODRP must serve all requests.

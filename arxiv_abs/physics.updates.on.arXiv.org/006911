The past few decades have seen major developments in the design and operation of cryogenic particle
detectors. This technology offers an extremely good energy resolution, comparable to semiconductor
detectors, and a wide choice of target materials, making low temperature calorimetric detectors
ideal for a variety of particle physics applications. Rare event searches have continued to require
ever greater exposures, which has driven them to ever larger cryogenic detectors, with the CUORE
experiment being the first to reach a tonne-scale, mK-cooled, experimental mass. CUORE, designed
to search for neutrinoless double beta decay, has been operational since 2017 at a temperature of
about 10 mK. This result has been attained by the use of an unprecedentedly large cryogenic infrastructure
called the CUORE cryostat: conceived, designed and commissioned for this purpose. In this article
the main characteristics and features of the cryogenic facility developed for the CUORE experiment
are highlighted. A brief introduction of the evolution of the field and of the past cryogenic facilities
are given. The motivation behind the design and development of the CUORE cryogenic facility is detailed
as are the steps taken toward realization, commissioning, and operation of the CUORE cryostat.
The major challenges overcome by the collaboration and the solutions implemented throughout the
building of the cryogenic facility will be discussed along with the potential improvements for
future facilities. The success of CUORE has opened the door to a new generation of large-scale cryogenic
facilities in numerous fields of science. Broader implications of the incredible feat achieved
by the CUORE collaboration on the future cryogenic facilities in various fields ranging from neutrino
and dark matter experiments to quantum computing will be examined.

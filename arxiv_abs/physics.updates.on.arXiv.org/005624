To unravel the structures of C12H12O7 isomers, identified as light-absorbing photooxidation
products of syringol in atmospheric chamber experiments, we apply a graph-based molecule generator
and machine learning workflow. To accomplish this in a bias-free manner, molecular graphs of the
entire chemical subspace of C12H12O7 were generated, assuming that the isomers contain two C6-rings;
this led to 260 million molecular graphs and 120 million stable structures. Using quantum chemistry
excitation energies and oscillator strengths as training data, we predicted these quantities
using kernel ridge regression and simulated UV/Vis absorption spectra. Then we determined the
probability of the molecules to cause the experimental spectrum within the errors of the different
methods. Molecules whose spectra were likely to match the experimental spectrum were clustered
according to structural features, resulting in clusters of > 500,000 molecules. While we identified
several features that correlate with a high probability to cause the experimental spectrum, no
clear composition of necessary features can be given. Thus, the absorption spectrum is not sufficient
to uniquely identify one specific isomer structure. If more structural features were known from
experimental data, the number of structures could be reduced to a few tens of thousands candidates.
We offer a procedure to detect when sufficient fragmentation data has been included to reduce the
number of possible molecules. The most efficient strategy to obtain valid candidates is obtained
if structural data is applied already at the bias-free molecule generation stage. The systematic
enumeration, however, is necessary to avoid mis-identification of molecules, while it guarantees
that there are no other molecules that would also fit the spectrum in question.

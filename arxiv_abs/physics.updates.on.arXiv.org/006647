Recent detector concepts at future linear or circular $e^- e^+$ colliders ($HZ^0$ and $t \bar{t}$
factories) emphasize the benefits of time-of-flight measurements for particle identification
of long-lived charged hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}, K^{\pm}$ and $p / \bar{p}$). That method relies on a
precise estimation of the time-of-flight as expected, for a given mass hypothesis, from the reconstructed
particle momentum and its trajectory. We show that for a realistic detector set-up, relativistic
formulae are a good approximation down to lowest possible momenta. The optimally fitted track parameters
are commonly defined near the interaction region. Extrapolation to a time-of-flight counter located
behind the central tracking device can usually only be performed by a track model undisturbed from
material effects. However, the true trajectory is distorted by multiple Coulomb scattering, and
the momentum is changed by energy loss. As a consequence, the estimated time-of-flight is biased
by a large systematic error. This study presents a novel approach of time-of-flight estimation
by splitting the trajectory into a chain of undisturbed track elements, following as close as possible
the true trajectory. Each track element possesses an individual momentum $p_i$ and flight distance
$l_i$. Remarkably, our formulae emerge by formally replacing the global momentum squared $p^2$
by the weighted harmonic mean of the individual $\{ p_i^2 \}$, with the weights being the corresponding
individual $\{ l_i \}$. The optimally fitted parameters of the individual track elements can be
obtained from track reconstruction by a Kalman filter plus smoother. Formulae for a simple scenario
(homogeneous magnetic field and cylindrical surfaces) are given. A Monte Carlo study corroborating
our approach will follow.

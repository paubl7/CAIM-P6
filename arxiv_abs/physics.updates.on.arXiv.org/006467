In subsurface multiphase flow simulations, poor nonlinear solver performance is a significant
runtime sink. The system of fully implicit mass balance equations is highly nonlinear and often
difficult to solve for the nonlinear solver, generally Newton(-Raphson). Strong nonlinearities
can cause Newton iterations to converge very slowly. This frequently results in time step cuts,
leading to computationally expensive simulations. Much literature has looked into how to improve
the nonlinear solver through enhancements or safeguarding updates. In this work, we take a different
approach; we aim to improve convergence with a smoother finite volume discretization scheme which
is more suitable for the Newton solver. Building on recent work, we propose a novel total velocity
hybrid upwinding scheme with weighted average flow mobilities (WA-HU TV) that is unconditionally
monotone and extends to compositional multiphase simulations. Analyzing the solution space of
a one-cell problem, we demonstrate the improved properties of the scheme and explain how it leverages
the advantages of both phase potential upwinding and arithmetic averaging. This results in a flow
subproblem that is smooth with respect to changes in the sign of phase fluxes, and is well-behaved
when phase velocities are large or when co-current viscous forces dominate. Additionally, we propose
a WA-HU scheme with a total mass (WA-HU TM) formulation that includes phase densities in the weighted
averaging. The proposed WA-HU TV consistently outperforms existing schemes, yielding benefits
from 5\% to over 50\% reduction in nonlinear iterations. The WA-HU TM scheme also shows promising
results; in some cases leading to even more efficiency. However, WA-HU TM can occasionally also
lead to convergence issues. Overall, based on the current results, we recommend the adoption of
the WA-HU TV scheme as it is highly efficient and robust.

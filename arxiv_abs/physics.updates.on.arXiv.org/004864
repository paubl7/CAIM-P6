High Q optical resonators are a key component for ultra-narrow linewidth lasers, frequency stabilization,
precision spectroscopy and quantum applications. Integration of these resonators in a photonic
waveguide wafer-scale platform is key to reducing their cost, size and power as well as sensitivity
to environmental disturbances. However, to date, the intrinsic Q of integrated all-waveguide
resonators has been relegated to below 150 Million. Here, we report an all-waveguide Si3N4 resonator
with an intrinsic Q of 422 Million and a 3.4 Billion absorption loss limited Q. The resonator has a
453 kHz intrinsic linewidth and 906 kHz loaded linewidth, with a finesse of 3005. The corresponding
linear loss of 0.060 dB/m is the lowest reported to date for an all-waveguide design with deposited
upper cladding oxide. These are the highest intrinsic and absorption loss limited Q factors and
lowest linewidth reported to date for a photonic integrated all-waveguide resonator. This level
of performance is achieved through a careful reduction of scattering and absorption loss components.
We quantify, simulate and measure the various loss contributions including scattering and absorption
including surface-state dangling bonds that we believe are responsible in part for absorption.
In addition to the ultra-high Q and narrow linewidth, the resonator has a large optical mode area
and volume, both critical for ultra-low laser linewidths and ultra-stable, ultra-low frequency
noise reference cavities. These results demonstrate the performance of bulk optic and etched resonators
can be realized in a photonic integrated solution, paving the way towards photonic integration
compatible Billion Q cavities for precision scientific systems and applications such as nonlinear
optics, atomic clocks, quantum photonics and high-capacity fiber communications systems on-chip.

Bayesian model selection enables comparison and ranking of conceptual subsurface models described
by spatial prior models, according to the support provided by available geophysical data. Deep
generative neural networks can efficiently encode such complex spatial priors, thereby, allowing
for a strong model dimensionality reduction that comes at the price of enhanced non-linearity.
In this setting, we explore a recent adaptive sequential Monte Carlo (ASMC) approach that builds
on Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS); a method that provides both the posterior probability density
function (PDF) and the evidence (a central quantity for Bayesian model selection) through a particle
approximation. Both techniques are well suited to parallel computation and rely on importance
sampling over a sequence of intermediate distributions, linking the prior and the posterior PDF.
Each subsequent distribution is approximated by updating the particle weights and states, compared
with the previous approximation, using a small pre-defined number of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
proposal steps. Compared with AIS, the ASMC method adaptively tunes the tempering between neighboring
distributions and performs resampling of particles when the variance of the particle weights becomes
too large. We evaluate ASMC using two different conceptual models and associated synthetic cross-hole
ground penetrating radar (GPR) tomography data. For the most challenging test case, we find that
the ASMC method is faster and more reliable in locating the posterior PDF than state-of-the-art
adaptive MCMC. The evidence estimates are found to be robust with respect to the choice of ASMC algorithmic
variables and much less sensitive to the model proposal type than MCMC.[...]

Scientific computing is at the core of many High-Performance Computing applications, including
computational flow dynamics. Because of the uttermost importance to simulate increasingly larger
computational models, hardware acceleration is receiving increased attention due to its potential
to maximize the performance of scientific computing. A Field-Programmable Gate Array is a reconfigurable
hardware accelerator that is fully customizable in terms of computational resources and memory
storage requirements of an application during its lifetime. Therefore, it is an ideal candidate
to accelerate scientific computing applications because of the possibility to fully customize
the memory hierarchy important in irregular applications such as iterative linear solvers found
in scientific libraries. In this paper, we study the potential of using FPGA in HPC because of the
rapid advances in reconfigurable hardware, such as the increase in on-chip memory size, increasing
number of logic cells, and the integration of High-Bandwidth Memories on board. To perform this
study, we first propose a novel ILU0 preconditioner tightly integrated with a BiCGStab solver kernel
designed using a mixture of High-Level Synthesis and Register-Transfer Level hand-coded design.
Second, we integrate the developed preconditioned iterative solver in Flow from the Open Porous
Media (OPM) project, a state-of-the-art open-source reservoir simulator. Finally, we perform
a thorough evaluation of the FPGA solver kernel in both standalone mode and integrated into the reservoir
simulator that includes all the on-chip URAM and BRAM, on-board High-Bandwidth Memory, and off-chip
CPU memory data transfers required in a complex simulator software such as OPM's Flow. We evaluate
the performance on the Norne field, a real-world case reservoir model using a grid with more than
10^5 cells and using 3 unknowns per cell.

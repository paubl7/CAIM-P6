The ability to amplify optical signals is of pivotal importance across science and technology.
The development of optical amplifiers has revolutionized optical communications, which are today
pervasively used in virtually all sensing and communication applications of coherent laser sources.
In the telecommunication bands, optical amplifiers typically utilize gain media based on III-V
semiconductors or rare-earth-doped fibers. Another way to amplify optical signals is to utilize
the Kerr nonlinearity of optical fibers or waveguides via parametric processes. Such parametric
amplifiers of travelling continuous wave have been originally developed in the microwave domain,
and enable quantum-limited signal amplification with high peak gain, broadband gain spectrum
tailored via dispersion control, and ability to enable phase sensitive amplification. Despite
these advantages, optical amplifiers based on parametric gain have proven impractical in silica
fibers due to the low Kerr nonlinearity. Recent advances in photonic integrated circuits have revived
interest in parametric amplifiers due to the significantly increased nonlinearity in various
integrated platforms. Yet, despite major progress, continuous-wave-pumped parametric amplifiers
built on photonic chips have to date remained out of reach. Here we demonstrate a chip-based travelling-wave
optical parametric amplifier with net signal gain in the continuous-wave regime. Using ultralow-loss,
dispersion-engineered, meter-long, silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits that are tightly
coiled on a photonic chip, we achieve a continuous parametric gain of 12 dB that exceeds both the on-chip
optical propagation loss and fiber-chip-fiber coupling losses in the optical C-band.

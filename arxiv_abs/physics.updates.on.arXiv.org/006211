The geometric phase can be acquired for the idler or signal wave through rotation of the quasi-phase-matching
(QPM) parameters in the $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear process using sum-frequency generation (SFG)
or difference-frequency generation (DFG). In the case of a weak idler and signal coupled by a strong
pump, the system is linear, and the geometric phase can be well predicted via the available knowledge.
However, once the intensities of the signal and idler become comparable to that of the pump, the system
becomes nonlinear, and the geometric phase accumulated via the circular rotation of QPM parameters
deviates from the prediction at the linear limit. This deviation is a nonmonotonic function and
strongly depends on the intensities of the input waves, which brings great uncertainty in the precise
creation or manipulation of the geometric phase in the pump-dependent process. In this paper, we
study two rotation schemes, full-wedge rotation, and half-wedge rotation, of the QPM parameters
in the process of fully nonlinear three-wave mixing. In the full-wedge rotation scheme, the geometric
phase is independent of pump depletion due to the nonadiabatic variation of the phase factor of the
QPM parameters. In contrast, in the half-wedge rotation scheme, in which the three QPM parameters
vary adiabatically, the geometric phase linearly depends on the pump depletion level. The results
show that the geometric phase can be accurately controlled in the nonlinear frequency conversion.
Finally, a design scheme of all-optically controlled second-harmonic beam shaping is presented.
This finding effectively suppresses the uncertainty in creating the geometric phase in the depleted
nonlinear frequency conversion process and provides an avenue toward constant control of the geometric
phase in nonlinear optics applications and quantum information processing.

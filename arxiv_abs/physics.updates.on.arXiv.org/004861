Any type of non-buoyant material in the ocean is transported horizontally by currents during its
sinking journey. This lateral transport can be far from negligible for small sinking velocities.
To estimate its magnitude and direction, the material is often modelled as a set of Lagrangian particles
advected by current velocities that are obtained from Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs).
State-of-the-art OGCMs are strongly eddying, similar to the real ocean, providing results with
a spatial resolution on the order of 10 km on a daily frequency. While the importance of eddies in OGCMs
is well-appreciated in the physical oceanographic community, other marine research communities
may not. To demonstrate how much the absence of mesoscale features in low-resolution models influences
the Lagrangian particle transport, we simulate the transport of sinking Lagrangian particles
using low- and high-resolution global OGCMs, and assess the lateral transport differences resulting
from the difference in spatial and temporal model resolution. We find major differences between
the transport in the non-eddying OGCM and in the eddying OGCM. Addition of stochastic noise to the
particle trajectories in the non-eddying OGCM parameterises the effect of eddies well in some cases.
The effect of a coarser temporal resolution (5-daily) is smaller compared to a coarser spatial resolution
(0.1$^{\circ}$ versus 1$^{\circ}$ horizontally). We recommend to use sinking Lagrangian particles,
representing e.g. marine snow, microplankton or sinking plastic, only with velocity fields from
eddying OGCMs, requiring high-resolution models in e.g. paleoceanographic studies. To increase
the accessibility of our particle trace simulations, we launch planktondrift.science.uu.nl,
an online tool to reconstruct the surface origin of sedimentary particles in a specific location.

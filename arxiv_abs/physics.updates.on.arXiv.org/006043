Here we present the results of the comparative analysis of the regular daily variations of the geomagnetic
field, Sq and SD, obtained from the observations with two methods: (1) using the so-called geomagnetically
quiet day (QD) to calculate mean daily variations and (2) using the principal component analysis
(PCA) to decompose original series into main variability modes. The original geomagnetic field
series were obtained at the Coimbra Magnetic Observatory (COI, Portugal) in 01.01.2007-31.12.2017.
The data were analyzed separately for each of 12 months. The geomagnetic field components X, Y and
Z were analyzed independently. The Sq and SD variations obtained with QD were compared with the principal
components from PCA (PCs, daily variation of the geomagnetic field of different types) using the
correlation analysis. In this study only the PCA ability to extract daily variations similar to
ones acquired using the standard approach with QD was analyzed. The results for X, and Y and Z are essentially
different. The Sq variation is always filtered to the 1st PCA mode for Y and Z, whereas the SD variation
is filtered either to the 2nd or 3rd mode. For X the Sq variation tends to be filtered to the 2nd mode,
while the SD variation is more often filtered to the 1st mode. The number of the PCs classified either
as Sq or SD follows seasonal and decadal variations of the geomagnetic activity. The analysis showed
that PCA can automatically extract the Sq variation from the observations of Y and Z; however complementary
analysis (for example, a comparison to a reference curve) is needed to identify a PC corresponding
to the SD variation. For X component, the automatic extraction of the Sq or SD variations is not possible,
and the complementary analysis is always needed. The dataset used in this paper is described in detail
in a companion paper by Morozova et al. (2021a).

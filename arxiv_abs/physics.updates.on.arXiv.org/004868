The existence of a quiescent core (QC) in the center of turbulent channel flows was demonstrated
in recent experimental and numerical studies. The QC-region, which is characterized by relatively
uniform velocity magnitude and weak turbulence levels, occupies about $40\%$ of the cross-section
at Reynolds numbers $Re_\tau$ ranging from $1000$ to $4000$. The influence of the QC region and its
boundaries on transport and accumulation of inertial particles has never been investigated before.
Here, we first demonstrate that a QC is unidentifiable at $Re_\tau = 180$, before an in-depth exploration
of particle-laden turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau = 600$ is performed. The inertial spheres
exhibited a tendency to accumulate preferentially in high-speed regions within the QC, i.e. contrary
to the well-known concentration in low-speed streaks in the near-wall region. The particle wall-normal
distribution, quantified by means of Vorono\"i volumes and particle number concentrations, varied
abruptly across the QC-boundary and vortical flow structures appeared as void areas due to the centrifugal
mechanism. The QC-boundary, characterized by a localized strong shear layer, appeared as a \emph{barrier},
across which transport of inertial particles is hindered. Nevertheless, the statistics conditioned
in QC-frame show that the mean velocity of particles outside of the QC was towards the core, whereas
particles within the QC tended to migrate towards the wall. Such upward and downward particle motions
are driven by similar motions of fluid parcels. The present results show that the QC exerts a substantial
influence on transport and accumulation of inertial particles, which is of practical relevance
in high-Reynolds number channel flow.

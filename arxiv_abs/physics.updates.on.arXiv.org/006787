Acoustic emission (AE) characterization is an effective technique to indirectly capture the progressive
failure process of the brittle rock. In previous studies, both the experiment and numerical simulation
were adopted to investigate AE characteristics of the brittle rock. However, as the most popular
numerical model, the moment tensor model (MTM) did not reproduce the monitoring and analyzing manner
of AE signals from the physical experiment. Consequently, its result could not be constrained by
the experimental result. It is thus necessary to evaluate the consistency and compatibility between
the experiment and MTM. To fulfill this, we developed a particle-velocity-based model (PVBM) which
enabled directly monitor and analyze the particle velocity in the numerical model and had good robustness.
The PVBM imitated the actual experiment and could fill in gaps between the experiment and MTM. AE
experiments of Marine shale under uniaxial compression were carried out, of which results were
simulated by MTM. In general, the variation trend of the experimental result could be presented
by MTM. Nevertheless, magnitudes of AE parameters by MTM presented notable differences with more
than several orders compared with those by the experiment. We sequentially used PVBM as a proxy to
analyze these discrepancies quantitatively and make a systematical evaluation on AE characterization
of brittle rocks from the experiment to numerical simulation, considering the influence of wave
reflection, energy geometrical diffusion, viscous attenuation, particle size as well as progressive
deterioration of rock material. It was suggested that only the combination of MTM and PVBM could
reasonably and accurately acquire AE characteristics of the actual AE experiment of brittle rocks
by making full use of their respective advantages.

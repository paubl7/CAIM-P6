In the field of modeling, the word validation refers to simple comparisons between model outputs
and experimental data. Usually, this comparison constitutes plotting the model results against
data on the same axes to provide a visual assessment of agreement or lack thereof. However, there
are a number of concerns with such naive comparisons. First, these comparisons tend to provide qualitative
rather than quantitative assessments and are clearly insufficient for making decisions regarding
model validity. Second, they often disregard or only partly account for existing uncertainties
in the experimental observations or the model input parameters. Third, such comparisons can not
reveal whether the model is appropriate for the intended purposes, as they mainly focus on the agreement
in the observable quantities. These pitfalls give rise to the need for an uncertainty-aware framework
that includes a validation metric. This metric shall provide a measure for comparison of the system
response quantities of an experiment with the ones from a computational model, while accounting
for uncertainties in both. To address this need, we have developed a statistical framework that
incorporates a probabilistic modeling technique using a fully Bayesian approach. A Bayesian perspective
yields an optimal bias-variance trade-off against the experimental data and provide an integrative
metric for model validation that incorporates parameter and conceptual uncertainty. Additionally,
to accelerate the analysis for computationally demanding flow and transport models in porous media,
the framework is equipped with a model reduction technique, namely Bayesian Sparse Polynomial
Chaos Expansion. We demonstrate the capabilities of the aforementioned Bayesian validation framework
by applying it to an application for validation as well as uncertainty quantification of fluid flow
in fractured porous media.

The Government of India (GOI) announced a nationwide lockdown starting 25th March 2020 to contain
the spread of COVID-19, leading to an unprecedented decline in anthropogenic activities and in
turn improvements in ambient air quality. This is the first study to focus on highly time-resolved
chemical speciation and source apportionment of PM$_{2.5}$ to assess the impact of the lockdown
and subsequent relaxations on the sources of ambient PM$_{2.5}$ in Delhi, India. The elemental,
organic, and black carbon fractions of PM$_{2.5}$ were measured at the IIT Delhi campus from February
2020 to May 2020. We report source apportionment results using positive matrix factorization (PMF)
of organic and elemental fractions of PM$_{2.5}$ during the different phases of the lockdown. The
resolved sources such as vehicular emissions, domestic coal combustion, and semi-volatile oxygenated
organic aerosol (SVOOA) were found to decrease by 96%, 95%, and 86%, respectively, during lockdown
phase-1 as compared to pre-lockdown. An unforeseen rise in O$_3$ concentrations with declining
NO$_x$ levels was observed, similar to other parts of the globe, leading to the low-volatility oxygenated
organic aerosols (LVOOA) increasing to almost double the pre-lockdown concentrations during
the last phase of the lockdown. The effect of the lockdown was found to be less pronounced on other
resolved sources like secondary chloride, power plants, dust-related, hydrocarbon-like organic
aerosols (HOA), and biomass burning related emissions, which were also swayed by the changing meteorological
conditions during the four lockdown phases. The results presented in this study provide a basis
for future emission control strategies, quantifying the extent to which constraining certain
anthropogenic activities can ameliorate the ambient air.

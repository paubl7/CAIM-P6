Free energies govern the behavior of soft and liquid matter, and improving their predictions could
have a large impact on the development of drugs, electrolytes or homogeneous catalysts. Unfortunately,
it is challenging to devise an accurate description of effects governing solvation such as hydrogen-bonding,
van der Waals interactions, or conformational sampling. We present a Free energy Machine Learning
(FML) model applicable throughout chemical compound space and based on a representation that employs
Boltzmann averages to account for an approximated sampling of configurational space. Using the
FreeSolv database, FML's out-of-sample prediction errors of experimental hydration free energies
decay systematically with training set size, and experimental uncertainty (0.6 kcal/mol) is reached
after training on 490 molecules (80\% of FreeSolv). Corresponding FML model errors are also on par
with state-of-the art physics based approaches. To generate the input representation for a new
query compound, FML requires approximate and short molecular dynamics runs. We showcase its usefulness
through analysis of FML solvation free energies for 116k organic molecules (all force-field compatible
molecules in QM9 database) identifying the most and least solvated systems, and rediscovering
quasi-linear structure property relationships in terms of simple descriptors such as hydrogen-bond
donors, number of NH or OH groups, number of oxygen atoms in hydrocarbons, and number of heavy atoms.
FML's accuracy is maximal when the temperature used for the molecular dynamics simulation to generate
averaged input representation samples in training is the same as for the query compounds. The sampling
time for the representation converges rapidly with respect to the prediction error.

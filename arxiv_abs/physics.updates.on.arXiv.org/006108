Topological phases feature robust edge states that are protected against the effects of defects
and disorder. The robustness of these states presents opportunities to design technologies that
are tolerant to fabrication errors and resilient to environmental fluctuations. While most topological
phases rely on conservative, or Hermitian, couplings, recent theoretical efforts have combined
conservative and dissipative couplings to propose new topological phases for ultracold atoms
and for photonics. However, the topological phases that arise due to purely dissipative couplings
remain largely unexplored. Here we realize dissipatively coupled versions of two prominent topological
models, the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the Harper-Hofstadter (HH) model, in the synthetic
dimensions of a time-multiplexed photonic resonator network. We observe the topological edge
state of the SSH and HH models, measure the SSH model's band structure, and induce a topological phase
transition between the SSH model's trivial and topological phases. In stark contrast with conservatively
coupled topological phases, the topological phases of our network arise from bands of dissipation
rates that possess nontrivial topological invariants, and the edge states of these topological
phases exhibit isolated dissipation rates that occur in the gaps between the bulk dissipation bands.
Our results showcase the ability of dissipative couplings to enable time-reversal symmetry broken
topological phases with nonzero Chern numbers, which have proven challenging to realize in the
optical domain. Moreover, our time-multiplexed network, with its ability to implement multiple
synthetic dimensions, dynamic and inhomogeneous couplings, and time-reversal symmetry breaking
synthetic gauge fields, offers a flexible and scalable architecture for future work in synthetic
dimensions.

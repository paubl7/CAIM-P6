Mars lacks a substantial magnetic field; as a result, the solar wind ablates the Martian atmosphere,
making the surface uninhabitable. Therefore, any terraforming attempt will require an artificial
Martian magnetic shield. The fundamental challenge of building an artificial magnetosphere is
to condense planetary-scale currents and magnetic fields down to the smallest mass possible. Superconducting
electromagnets offer a way to do this. However, the underlying physics of superconductors and electromagnets
limits this concentration. Based upon these fundamental limitations, we show that the amount of
superconducting material is proportional to $B_c^{-2}a^{-3}$, where $B_c$ is the critical magnetic
field for the superconductor and $a$ is the loop radius of a solenoid. Since $B_c$ is set by fundamental
physics, the only truly adjustable parameter for the design is the loop radius; a larger loop radius
minimizes the amount of superconducting material required. This non-intuitive result means that
the "intuitive" strategy of building a compact electromagnet and placing it between Mars and the
Sun at the first Lagrange point is unfeasible. Considering reasonable limits on $B_c$, the smallest
possible loop radius is $\sim$10 km, and the magnetic shield would have a mass of $\sim 10^{19}$ g.
Most high-temperature superconductors are constructed of rare elements; given solar system abundances,
building a superconductor with $\sim 10^{19}$ g would require mining a solar system body with several
times $10^{25}$ g; this is approximately 10% of Mars. We find that the most feasible design is to encircle
Mars with a superconducting wire with a loop radius of $\sim$ 3400 km. The resulting wire diameter
can be as small as $\sim$5 cm. With this design, the magnetic shield would have a mass of $\sim 10^{12}$
g and would require mining $\sim 10^{18}$ g, or only 0.1\% of Olympus Mons.

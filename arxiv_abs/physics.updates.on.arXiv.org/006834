We present two accurate and efficient algorithms for solving the incompressible, irrotational
Euler equations with a free surface in two dimensions with background flow over a periodic, multiply-connected
fluid domain that includes stationary obstacles and variable bottom topography. One approach
is formulated in terms of the surface velocity potential while the other evolves the vortex sheet
strength. Both methods employ layer potentials in the form of periodized Cauchy integrals to compute
the normal velocity of the free surface. We prove that the resulting second-kind Fredholm integral
equations are invertible. In the velocity potential formulation, invertibility is achieved after
a physically motivated finite-rank correction. The integral equations for the two methods are
closely related, one being the adjoint of the other after modifying it to evaluate the layer potentials
on the opposite side of each interface. In addition to a background flow, both formulations allow
for circulation around each obstacle, which leads to multiple-valued velocity potentials but
single-valued stream functions. The proposed boundary integral methods are compatible with graph-based
or angle-arclength parameterizations of the free surface. In the latter case, we show how to avoid
curve reconstruction errors in interior Runge-Kutta stages due to incompatibility of the angle-arclength
representation with spatial periodicity. The proposed methods are used to study gravity-capillary
waves generated by flow over three elliptical obstacles with different choices of the circulation
parameters. In each case, the free surface forms a structure resembling a Crapper wave that narrows
and eventually self intersects in a splash singularity.

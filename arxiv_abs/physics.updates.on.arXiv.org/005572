Laser based ranging (LiDAR) - already ubiquitously used in robotics, industrial monitoring, or
geodesy - is a key sensor technology for future autonomous driving, and has been employed in nearly
all successful implementations of autonomous vehicles to date. Coherent laser allows long-range
detection, operates eye safe, is immune to crosstalk and yields simultaneous velocity and distance
information. Yet for actual deployment in vehicles, video frame-rate requirements for object
detection, classification and sensor fusion mandate megapixel per second measurement speed.
Such pixel rates are not possible to attain with current coherent single laser-detector architectures
at high definition range imagining, and make parallelization essential. A megapixel class coherent
LiDAR has not been demonstrated, and is still impeded by the arduous requirements of large banks
of detectors and digitizers on the receiver side, that need to be integrated on chip. Here we report
hardware efficient coherent laser ranging at megapixel per second imaging rates. This is achieved
using a novel concept for massively parallel coherent laser ranging that requires only a single
laser and a single photoreceiver, yet achieves simultaneous recording of more than 64 channels
with distance and velocity measurements each - attaining an unprecedented 5 megapixel per second
rate. Heterodyning two offset chirped soliton microcombs on a single coherent receiver yields
an interferogram containing both distance and velocity information of all particular channels,
thereby alleviating the need to individually separate, detect and digitize distinct channels.
The reported LiDAR implementation is hardware-efficient, compatible with photonic integration
and demonstrates the significant advantages of acquisition speed, complexity and cost benefits
afforded by the convergence of optical telecommunication and metrology technologies.

Our ability to control a whole network can be achieved via a small set of driver nodes. While the minimum
number of driver nodes needed for control is fixed in a given network, there are multiple choices
for the driver node set. A quantity used to investigate this multiplicity is the fraction of redundant
nodes in the network, referring to nodes that do not need any external control. Previous work has
discovered a bimodality feature characterized by a bifurcation diagram: networks with the same
statistical property would stay with equal probability to have a large or small fraction of redundant
nodes. Here we find that this feature is rooted in the symmetry of the directed network, where both
the degree distribution and the degree correlation can play a role. The in-in and out-out degree
correlation will suppress the bifurcation, as networks with such degree correlations are asymmetric
under network transpose. The out-in and in-out degree correlation do not change the network symmetry,
hence the bimodality feature is preserved. However, the out-in degree correlation will change
the critical average degree needed for the bifurcation. Hence by fixing the average degree of networks
and tuning out-in degree correlation alone, we can observe a similar bifurcation diagram. We conduct
analytical analyses that adequately explain the emergence of bimodality caused by out-in degree
correlation. We also propose a quantity, taking both degree distribution and degree correlation
into consideration, to predict if a network would be at the upper or lower branch of the bifurcation.
As is well known that most real networks are not neutral, our results extend our understandings of
the controllability of complex networks.

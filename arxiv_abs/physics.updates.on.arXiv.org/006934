A framework is introduced to compare moist `potential' temperatures. The equivalent potential
temperature, $\theta_e,$ the liquid water potential temperature, $\theta_\ell,$ and the entropy
potential temperature, $\theta_s$ are all shown to be potential temperatures in the sense that
they measure the temperature moist-air, in some specified state, must have to have the same entropy
as the air-parcel that they characterize. They only differ in the choice of reference state composition:
$\theta_\ell$ describes the temperature a condensate-free state, $\theta_e$ a vapor-free state,
and $\theta_s$ a water-free state would require to have the same entropy as the given state. Although
in this sense $\theta_e,$ $\theta_\ell,$ and $\theta_s$ are all different flavors of the same thing,
only $\theta_\ell$ satisfies the stricter definition of a `potential temperature', as corresponding
to a reference temperature accessible by an isentropic and closed transformation of a system in
equilibrium; only $\theta_e$ approximately measures the ability of moist-air to do work; and only
$\theta_s$ measures air-parcel entropy. None mix linearly, but all do so approximately, and all
reduce to the dry potential temperature, $\theta$ in the limit as the water mass fraction goes to
zero. As is well known, $\theta$ does mix linearly and inherits all the favorable (entropic, enthalpic,
and potential temperature) properties of its various -- but descriptively less rich -- moist counterparts.
All, involve quite complex expressions, but admit relatively simple and useful approximations.
Of the three moist `potential' temperatures, $\theta_s$ is the least familiar, but the most well
mixed in the broader tropics, a property that merits further study as a basis for constraining mixing
processes.

We argue that the success of DFT can be understood in terms of a semiclassical expansion around a very
specific limit. This limit was identified long ago by Lieb and Simon for the total electronic energy
of a system. This is a universal limit of all electronic structure: atoms, molecules, and solids.
For the total energy, Thomas-Fermi theory becomes relatively exact in the limit. The limit can also
be studied for much simpler model systems, including non-interacting fermions in a one-dimensional
well, where the WKB approximation applies for individual eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Summation
techniques lead to energies and densities that are functionals of the potential. We consider several
examples in one dimension (fermions in a box, in a harmonic well, in a linear half-well, and in the
P\"oschl-Teller well. The effects of higher dimension are also illustrated with the three-dimensional
harmonic well and the Bohr atom, non-interacting fermions in a Coulomb well. Modern density functional
calculations use the Kohn-Sham scheme almost exclusively. The same semiclassical limit can be
studied for the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy, for the exchange energy, and for the correlation energy.
For all three, the local density approximation appears to become relatively exact in this limit.
Recent work, both analytic and numerical, explores how this limit is approached, in an effort to
deduce the leading corrections to the local approximation. A simple scheme, using the Euler-Maclaurin
summation formula, is the result of many different attempts at this problem. In very simple cases,
the correction formulas are much more accurate than standard density functionals. Several functionals
are already in widespread use in both chemistry and materials that incorporate these limits, and
prospects for the future are discussed.

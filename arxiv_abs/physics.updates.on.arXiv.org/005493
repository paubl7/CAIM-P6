Neural network-based algorithms have garnered considerable attention in condensed matter physics
for their ability to learn complex patterns from very high dimensional data sets towards classifying
complex long-range patterns of entanglement and correlations in many-body quantum systems. Small-scale
quantum computers are already showing potential gains in learning tasks on large quantum and very
large classical data sets. A particularly interesting class of algorithms, the quantum convolutional
neural networks (QCNN) could learn features of a quantum data set by performing a binary classification
task on a nontrivial phase of quantum matter. Inspired by this promise, we present a generalization
of QCNN, the branching quantum convolutional neural network, or bQCNN, with substantially higher
expressibility. A key feature of bQCNN is that it leverages mid-circuit (intermediate) measurement
results, realizable on current trapped-ion systems, obtained in pooling layers to determine which
sets of parameters will be used in the subsequent convolutional layers of the circuit. This results
in a branching structure, which allows for a greater number of trainable variational parameters
in a given circuit depth. This is of particular use on current-day NISQ devices, where circuit depth
is limited by gate noise. We present an overview of the ansatz structure and scaling, and provide
evidence of its enhanced expressibility compared to QCNN. Using artificially-constructed large
data sets of training states as a proof-of-concept we demonstrate the existence of training tasks
in which bQCNN far outperforms an ordinary QCNN. Finally, we present future directions where the
classical branching structure and increased density of trainable parameters in bQCNN would be
particularly valuable.

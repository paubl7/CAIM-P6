Singlet oxygen (O2) comes in two flavors -- namely the dominant lower-energy a 1 Delta g state and
the higher-energy shorter-lived b 1 Sigma + g state -- and plays a key role in many photochemical and
photobiological reactions. For this reason, and because of the large size of the systems treated,
many papers have appeared with density-functional theory (DFT) treatments of the reactions of
1 O 2 with different chemical species. The present work serves as a reminder that the common assumption
that it is enough to fix the spin multipicity as unity is not enough to insure a correct treatment of
singlet oxygen. We review the correct group theoretical treatment of the three lowest energy electronic
states of O 2 which, in the case of 1 O 2 is often so badly explained in the relevant photochemical literature
that the explanation borders on being incorrect and prevents, rather than encourages, a correct
treatment of this interesting and important photochemical species. We then show how many electronic
structure programs, such as a freely downloadable and personal-computer compatible Linux version
of deMon2k, may be used, together with the multiplet sum method (MSM), to obtain a more accurate estimation
of the potential energy curves (PECs) of the two 1 O 2 states. Various strengths and weaknesses of
different DFAs emerge through our application of the MSM method. In particular, the quality of the
a 1 Delta g excitation energy reflects how well functionals are able to describe the spin-flip energy
in DFT while the quality of the b 1 Sigma + g excitation energy reflects how well functionals are able
to describe the spin-pairing energy in DFT. Finally we note that improvements in DFT-based excited-state
methods will be needed to describe the full PECs of 1 O 2 including both the equilibrium bond lengths
and dissociation behavior.

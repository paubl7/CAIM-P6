Electro-optic (EO) modulators rely on interaction of optical and electrical signals with second-order
nonlinear media. For the optical signal, this interaction can be strongly enhanced by using dielectric
slot-waveguide structures that exploit a field discontinuity at the interface between a high-index
waveguide core and the low-index EO cladding. In contrast to this, the electrical signal is usually
applied through conductive regions in the direct vicinity of the optical waveguide. To avoid excessive
optical loss, the conductivity of these regions is maintained at a moderate level, thus leading
to inherent RC-limitations of the modulation bandwidth. In this paper, we show that these limitations
can be overcome by extending the slot-waveguide concept to the modulating radio-frequency (RF)
signal. Our device combines an RF slotline that relies on BaTiO3 as a high-k dielectric material
with a conventional silicon photonic slot waveguide and a highly efficient organic EO cladding
material. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we demonstrate a 1 mm-long Mach-Zehnder modulator
that offers a 3 dB-bandwidth of 76 GHz and a 6 dB-bandwidth of 110 GHz along with a small {\pi}-voltage
of 1.3 V (U{\pi}L = 1.3 V mm). To the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest EO bandwidth
so far achieved with a silicon photonic modulator based on dielectric waveguides. We further demonstrate
the viability of the device in a data transmission experiment using four-state pulse-amplitude
modulation (PAM4) at line rates up to 200 Gbit/s. Our first-generation devices leave vast room for
further improvement and may open an attractive route towards highly efficient silicon photonic
modulators that combine sub-1 mm device lengths with sub-1 V drive voltages and modulation bandwidths
of more than 100 GHz.

We investigate the potential of a recently proposed model for 3D compressible MHD turbulence (Chevillard
et al. 2010; Durrive et al. 2021) to be used as a tool to characterize statistically 2D and 3D turbulent
data. This model is parametrized by a dozen of free (intuitive, physically motivated) parameters,
which control the statistics of the fields (density, velocity and magnetic fields). The present
study is a proof of concept study: (i) we restrict ourselves to the incompressible hydrodynamical
part of the model, (ii) we consider as data centroid velocity maps, and (iii) we let only three of the
free parameters vary (namely the correlation length, the Hurst parameter and the intermittency
parameter). Within this framework, we demonstrate that, given a centroid velocity map, we can find
in an automated manner (i.e. by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis) values of the parameters such
that the model resembles the given map, i.e. which reproduces its statistics fairly well. Hence,
thanks to this procedure, one may characterize statistically, and thus compare, various turbulent
data. In other words, we show how this model may be used as a metric to compare observational or simulated
data sets. In addition, because this model is numerically particularly fast (nearly 500 times faster
than the numerical simulation we use to generate our reference data) it may be used as a surrogate
model. Finally, by this process we also initiate the first systematic exploration of the parameter
space of this model. Doing so, we show how the parameters impact the visual and the statistical properties
of centroid velocity maps, and exhibit the correlations between the various parameters, providing
new insight into the model.

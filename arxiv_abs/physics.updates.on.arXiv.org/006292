Complex networks represent the natural backbone to study epidemic processes in populations of
interacting individuals. Such a modeling framework, however, is naturally limited to pairwise
interactions, making it less suitable to properly describe social contagion, where individuals
acquire new norms or ideas after simultaneous exposure to multiple sources of infections. Simplicial
contagion has been proposed as an alternative framework where simplices are used to encode group
interactions of any order. The presence of higher-order interactions leads to explosive epidemic
transitions and bistability which cannot be obtained when only dyadic ties are considered. In particular,
critical mass effects can emerge even for infectivity values below the standard pairwise epidemic
threshold, where the size of the initial seed of infectious nodes determines whether the system
would eventually fall in the endemic or the healthy state. Here we extend simplicial contagion to
time-varying networks, where pairwise and higher-order simplices can be created or destroyed
over time. By following a microscopic Markov chain approach, we find that the same seed of infectious
nodes might or might not lead to an endemic stationary state, depending on the temporal properties
of the underlying network structure, and show that persistent temporal interactions anticipate
the onset of the endemic state in finite-size systems. We characterize this behavior on higher-order
networks with a prescribed temporal correlation between consecutive interactions and on heterogeneous
simplicial complexes, showing that temporality again limits the effect of higher-order spreading,
but in a less pronounced way than for homogeneous structures. Our work suggests the importance of
incorporating temporality, a realistic feature of many real-world systems, into the investigation
of dynamical processes beyond pairwise interactions.

Energy-frontier accelerators provide powerful tools performing high precision measurements
confirming the fundamental of the physics and broadening new research horizons. Such machines
are either driven by circular or linear accelerators. The circular machines, having the center-mass
(CM) energy values reaching 200 GeV (for leptons) and above, experience beam energy loss and quality
dilution, for example, due to synchrotron radiation, limiting the overall CM energy achievable
and requiring a constant energy top-up to compensate the loss and the beam quality dilution. Linear
colliders overcome these limitations, while the finite capabilities of generating high average
current beams limits the luminosity. This is partially compensated by the quality of the colliding
beams. In this work, we suggest a novel design of circular-linear accelerator based on the merging
of the "non-emitting", low-energy storage rings and energy recovery linear accelerators. We suggest
using the recently considered dual-axis asymmetric cavities to enable the operation of such a system,
and in particular the energy recovery from spent, high-intensity beams. The machine considered,
under the scope of the SNOWMASS-2021 initiative, can be potentially used to reach ultimate energy
frontiers in high-energy physics as well as to drive next generation light sources. The merging
of circular and linear systems, and applications of dual axes cavities, should allow the maintaining
of high beam quality, high luminosity, and high energy efficiency - "The Best of Both Words". It also
offers a flexible energy management, opening clear opportunity for reducing the running cost.
We note that the numbers shown in the paper are for illustration purpose and can be improved further.

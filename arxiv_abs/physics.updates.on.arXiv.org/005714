We study the effect of reaction time on the kinetics of relaxation to stationary state and on the congestion
transition in heterogeneous traffic using simulations of Newell's model on a ring. The heterogeneity
is modeled as quenched disorders in the parameters of the Newell's model and in the reaction time
of the drivers. The support of the reaction time distribution is chosen in such a way that there is
flow instability in the system. We observed that at low densities, the relaxation to stationary
state from a homogeneous initial state is governed by the same power-laws as derived by Ben-Naim
et al. The stationary state, at low densities, is a single giant platoon of vehicles with the slowest
vehicle being the leader of the platoon. We observed formation of spontaneous jams inside the giant
platoon which move upstream as stop-go waves and get dissipated at its tail. The transition happens
when the head of the giant platoon starts interacting with its tail and stable stop-go waves are formed
which circulate all over the ring without dissipation. We observed that the system behaves differently
when the transition point is approached from above and below. When the transition density is approached
from below, the gap distribution behind the leader has a double-peak and is fat-tailed but has a bounded
support and thus the maximum gap in the system and the variance of the gap distribution tend to size-independent
values. When the transition density is approached from above, the tail of the gap distribution becomes
a power-law, and consequently the maximum gap in the system and variance of the gap distribution
diverge as a power-law thereby creating a discontinuity in them at the transition. Thus we observe
a phase-transition of unusual kind in which both a discontinuity and a power-law are observed at
the transition density.

Infectious diseases and human behavior are intertwined. On one side, our movements and interactions
are the engines of transmission. On the other, the unfolding of viruses might induce changes to our
daily activities. While intuitive, our understanding of such feedback loop is still limited. Before
COVID-19 the literature on the subject was mainly theoretical and largely missed validation. The
main issue was the lack of empirical data capturing behavioral change induced by diseases. Things
have dramatically changed in 2020. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been the key
weapon against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and affected virtually any societal process. Travels bans,
events cancellation, social distancing, curfews, and lockdowns have become unfortunately very
familiar. The scale of the emergency, the ease of survey as well as crowdsourcing deployment guaranteed
by the latest technology, several Data for Good programs developed by tech giants, major mobile
phone providers, and other companies have allowed unprecedented access to data describing behavioral
changes induced by the pandemic. Here, I aim to review some of the vast literature written on the subject
of NPIs during the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, I analyze 347 articles written by more than 2518
of authors in the last $12$ months. While the large majority of the sample was obtained by querying
PubMed, it includes also a hand-curated list. Considering the focus, and methodology I have classified
the sample into seven main categories: epidemic models, surveys, comments/perspectives, papers
aiming to quantify the effects of NPIs, reviews, articles using data proxies to measure NPIs, and
publicly available datasets describing NPIs. I summarize the methodology, data used, findings
of the articles in each category and provide an outlook highlighting future challenges as well as
opportunities

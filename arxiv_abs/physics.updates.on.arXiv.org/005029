Nonadiabatic effects that arise from the concerted motion of electrons and nuclei at comparable
energy and time scales are omnipresent in metals and have been shown to affect measurable observables
in thermal and light-driven chemistry at surfaces. Vibrational state-to-state scattering of
NO on Au(111) has been one of the most studied examples in this regard, providing a testing ground
for developing various nonadiabatic theories, including electronic friction theory. This system
is often cited as the prime example for the breakdown of electronic friction theory, a very efficient
model accounting for dissipative forces on metal-adsorbed molecules due to the creation of electron-hole-pair
excitations in the metal. However, the exact failings compared to experiment and their origin from
theory are less clear. Here we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the performance
of molecular dynamics with electronic friction (MDEF) in describing vibrational state-to-state
scattering of NO on Au(111) and connect directly to fundamental approximations. While MDEF accurately
predicts elastic and single-quantum energy loss, we identify an underestimation of multi-quantum
energy loss and an overestimation of molecular trapping at high vibrational excitation as the main
limitations. We discuss the underestimation of multi-quantum energy loss and its potential remedy
in connection to the Markov approximation within MDEF. An analysis of the overestimation of trapping
leads to the conclusion that this failure constitutes a true breakdown of electronic friction theory,
the correct account of which requires theories that go beyond MDEF. Our analysis provides a firm
base line for the future development of nonadiabatic dynamics methods to tackle problems in surface
chemistry and photocatalysis.

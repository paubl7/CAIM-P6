We investigate the dynamics of cohesive particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence, based
on one-way coupled simulations that include Stokes drag, lubrication, cohesive and direct contact
forces. We observe a transient flocculation phase characterized by a growing average floc size,
followed by a statistically steady equilibrium phase. We analyze the temporal evolution of floc
size and shape due to aggregation, breakage, and deformation. Larger turbulent shear and weaker
cohesive forces yield elongated flocs that are smaller in size. Flocculation proceeds most rapidly
when the fluid and particle time scales are balanced and a suitably defined Stokes number is \textit{O}(1).
During the transient stage, cohesive forces of intermediate strength produce flocs of the largest
size, as they are strong enough to cause aggregation, but not so strong as to pull the floc into a compact
shape. Small Stokes numbers and weak turbulence delay the onset of the equilibrium stage. During
equilibrium, stronger cohesive forces yield flocs of larger size. The equilibrium floc size distribution
exhibits a preferred size that depends on the cohesive number. We observe that flocs are generally
elongated by turbulent stresses before breakage. Flocs of size close to the Kolmogorov length scale
preferentially align themselves with the intermediate strain direction and the vorticity vector.
Flocs of smaller size tend to align themselves with the extensional strain direction. More generally,
flocs are aligned with the strongest Lagrangian stretching direction. The Kolmogorov scale is
seen to limit floc growth. We propose a new flocculation model with a variable fractal dimension
that predicts the temporal evolution of the floc size and shape.

Various measures have been taken in different countries to mitigate the Covid-19 epidemic. But,
throughout the world, many citizens don't understand well how these measures are taken and even
question the decisions taken by their government. Should the measures be more (or less) restrictive?
Are they taken for a too long (or too short) period of time? To provide some quantitative elements
of response to these questions, we consider the well-known SEIR model for the Covid-19 epidemic
propagation and propose a pragmatic model of the government decision-making operation. Although
simple and obviously improvable, the proposed model allows us to study the tradeoff between health
and economic aspects in a pragmatic and insightful way. Assuming a given number of phases for the
epidemic and a desired tradeoff between health and economic aspects, it is then possible to determine
the optimal duration of each phase and the optimal severity level for each of them. The numerical
analysis is performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be applied to any country.
One of the takeaway messages of this analysis is that being able to implement the optimal 4-phase
epidemic management strategy in France would have led to 1.05 million infected people and a GDP loss
of 231 billion euro instead of 6.88 million of infected and a loss of 241 billion euro. This indicates
that, seen from the proposed model perspective, the effectively implemented epidemic management
strategy is good economically, whereas substantial improvements might have been obtained in terms
of health impact. Our analysis indicates that the lockdown/severe phase should have been more severe
but shorter, and the adjustment phase occurred earlier. Due to the natural tendency of people to
deviate from the official rules, updating measures every month over the whole epidemic episode
seems to be more appropriate.

Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) and wave propagation in engineering structures can cause severe
damage to piping systems or fluid machines, inducing serious accidents. In these phenomena, the
mechanism of structural damage depends on the wave propagation across the fluid-solid interface.
Previous studies reported that disagreements between the induced pressure value on the solid-fluid
movable interface and the value predicted by the classical one-dimensional theory arose from the
effects of two-dimensional wave propagation. To address this problem, in this study, a two-dimensional
axisymmetric simulation of wave propagation across the solid-fluid interface with FSI was conducted.
The simulation was performed using ANSYS Autodyn with a Lagrangian solver for solids and Eulerian
solver for water. The results showed that radial wave propagation caused by the dynamic effect of
the tube and water's inertia affected the peak pressure on the solid-fluid interface. The peak pressure
was attenuated near the tube wall because of the inertial effect of the tube and fluid expansion.
By calculating the mean pressure and axial stress to compare the simulated peak pressure with that
from one-dimensional acoustic theory, it was indicated that the transition region for transmitted
pressure was located immediately after the solid-fluid interface. In this region, the transmitted
peak pressure may exceed the value predicted by one-dimensional acoustic theory. The transition
region was oriented in the axial direction from the interface. In addition, prediction of the transmitted
peak pressure with one-dimensional acoustic theory was suggested via normal wave speed in the unconfined
fluid from a safety engineering perspective, although the circumferential stress generated in
the tube enclosing fluid can be sufficiently accurately predicted using the same theory with the
Korteweg speed.

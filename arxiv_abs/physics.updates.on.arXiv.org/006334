Three points should be central to fusion-program planning: (1) Obstacles stand in the way of a tokamak
power plant. It is unclear that these obstacles can be overcome by a smaller change in the configuration
than represented by stellarators. (2) The reliability of computational design of stellarators
should fundamentally change the strategy of fusion development. (3) A minimal time and risk construction
of a fusion power plant is mandated by the doubling of carbon dioxide emissions every thirty years.
Options must be developed for energy production that do not drive carbon-dioxide emissions and
can be fully deployed within a few doubling times. Unit size and cost of electricity are only relevant
in comparison to alternative worldwide energy solutions. Intermittency, site specificity, waste
management, and nuclear proliferation make fusion attractive as the basis for a carbon-free energy
system compared to the alternatives. Nonetheless, fusion is not an option for deployment until
a power plant has successfully operated. A critical element in a minimal time and risk program is
the use of computational design as opposed to just extrapolation. Only the stellarator has an empirical
demonstration of the reliable computational design through large changes in configuration properties
and scale. Is it responsible to delay the computational design of stellarators on the hope that a
tokamak power plant might be possible? The cost of computational design is extremely small, but
adequate time is required for the development of ideas that increase attractiveness and reduce
risks. Rapid power-plant construction without many intermediate steps may seem risky, but the
price is small compared to the cost of trillions of dollars for each year's delay in addressing carbon-dioxide
emissions.

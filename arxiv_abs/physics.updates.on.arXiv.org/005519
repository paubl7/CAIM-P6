In recent years simulations of chemistry and condensed materials has emerged as one of the preeminent
applications of quantum computing offering an exponential speedup for the solution of the electronic
structure for certain strongly correlated electronic systems. To date, most treatments have ignored
the question of whether relativistic effects, which are described most generally by quantum electrodynamics
(QED), can also be simulated on a quantum computer in polynomial time. Here we show that effective
QED, which is equivalent to QED to second order in perturbation theory, can be simulated in polynomial
time under reasonable assumptions while properly treating all four components of the wavefunction
of the fermionic field. In particular, we provide a detailed analysis of such simulations in position
and momentum basis using Trotter-Suzuki formulas. We find that the number of $T$-gates needed to
perform such simulations on a 3D lattice of $n_s$ sites scales at worst as $O(n_s^3/\epsilon)^{1+o(1)}$
in the thermodynamic limit for position basis simulations and $O(n_s^{4+2/3}/\epsilon)^{1+o(1)}$
in momentum basis. We also find that qubitization scales slightly better with a worst case scaling
of $\widetilde{O}(n_s^{2+2/3}/\epsilon)$ for lattice eQED and complications in the prepare
circuit leads to a slightly worse scaling in momentum basis of $\widetilde{O}(n_s^{5+2/3}/\epsilon)$.
We further provide concrete gate counts for simulating a relativistic version of the uniform electron
gas that show challenging problems can be simulated using fewer than $10^{13}$ non-Clifford operations
and also provide a detailed discussion of how to prepare MRCISD states in effective QED which provide
a reasonable initial guess for the groundstate. Finally, we estimate the planewave cutoffs needed
to accurately simulate heavy elements such as gold.

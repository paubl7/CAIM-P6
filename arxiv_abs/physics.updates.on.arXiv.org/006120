Semiconductor nanowires are promising material systems for coming of age nanotechnology. The
usage of the vapor solid solid (VSS) route, where the catalyst used for promoting axial growth of
nanowire is a solid, offers certain advantages compared to the common vapor liquid solid (VLS) route
(using liquid catalyst). The VSS growth of group-IV elemental nanowires have been investigated
by other groups in situ during growth in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Though it is known
that compound nanowire growth has different dynamics compared to monoatomic semiconductors,
the dynamics of VSS growth of compound nanowires has not been understood. Here we investigate VSS
growth of compound nanowires by in situ microscopy, using Au-seeded GaAs as a model system. The growth
kinetics and dynamics at the wire-catalyst interface by ledge-flow is studied and compared for
liquid and solid catalysts at similar growth conditions. Here the temperature and thermal history
of the system is manipulated to control the catalyst phase. In the first experiment discussed here
we reduce the growth temperature in steps to solidify the initially liquid catalyst, and compare
the dynamics between VLS and VSS growth observed at slightly different temperatures. In the second
experiment we exploit thermal hysteresis of the system to obtain both VLS and VSS at the same temperature.
The VSS growth rate is comparable or slightly slower than VLS growth. Unlike in the VLS case, during
VSS growth we see several occasions where a new layer starts before the previous layer is completely
grown, i.e. multilayer growth. Understanding the VSS growth mode enables better control of nanowire
properties by widening the range of usable nanowire growth parameters.

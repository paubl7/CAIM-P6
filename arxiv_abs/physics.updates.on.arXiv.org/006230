Within the framework of Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT), the ability to provide good
predictions of water properties by employing a strongly constrained and appropriately normed
(SCAN) functional has been extensively demonstrated in recent years. Here, we further advance
the modeling of water by building a more accurate model on the fourth rung of Jacob's ladder with the
hybrid functional, SCAN0. In particular, we carry out both classical and Feynman path-integral
molecular dynamics calculations of water with the SCAN0 functional and the isobaric-isothermal
ensemble. In order to generate the equilibrated structure of water, a deep neural network potential
is trained from the atomic potential energy surface based on ab initio data obtained from SCAN0 DFT
calculations. For the electronic properties of water, a separate deep neural network potential
is trained using the Deep Wannier method based on the maximally localized Wannier functions of the
equilibrated trajectory at the SCAN0 level. The structural, dynamic, and electric properties
of water were analyzed. The hydrogen-bond structures, density, infrared spectra, diffusion coefficients,
and dielectric constants of water, in the electronic ground state, are computed using a large simulation
box and long simulation time. For the properties involving electronic excitations, we apply the
GW approximation within many-body perturbation theory to calculate the quasiparticle density
of states and bandgap of water. Compared to the SCAN functional, mixing exact exchange mitigates
the self-interaction error in the meta-generalized-gradient approximation and further softens
liquid water towards the experimental direction. For most of the water properties, the SCAN0 functional
shows a systematic improvement over the SCAN functional.

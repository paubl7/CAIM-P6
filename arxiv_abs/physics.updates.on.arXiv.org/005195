Solar prominences are formed by partially ionized plasma with inter-particle collision frequencies
generally warranting magnetohydrodynamic treatment. In this work, we explore the dynamical impacts
and observable signatures of two-fluid effects in the parameter regimes when ion-neutral collisions
do not fully couple the neutral and charged fluids. We perform 2.5D two-fluid (charges - neutrals)
simulations of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) at a smoothly changing interface between
a solar prominence thread and the corona. The purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding
of the RTI and the effects of the partial ionization on the development of RTI using non-linear two-fluid
numerical simulations. Our two-fluid model takes into account viscosity, thermal conductivity,
and collisional interaction between neutrals and charges: ionization/recombination, energy
and momentum transfer, and frictional heating. In this paper I, the sensitivity of the RTI dynamics
to the prominence equilibrium configuration, including the impact of the magnetic field strength
and shear supporting the prominence thread, and the amount of prominence mass-loading is explored.
We show that, at small scales, a realistically smooth prominence-corona interface leads to qualitatively
different linear RTI evolution than that expected for a discontinuous interface, while magnetic
field shear has the stabilizing effect of reducing the growth rate or eliminating the instability.
In the non-linear phase, we observe that in the presence of field shear the development of the instability
leads to formation of coherent and interacting 2.5D magnetic structures, which, in turn, can lead
to substantial plasma flow across magnetic field lines and associated decoupling of the fluid velocities
of charges and neutrals.

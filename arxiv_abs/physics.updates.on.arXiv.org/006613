During its two-year mission at comet 67P, Rosetta nearly continuously monitored the inner coma
plasma environment for gas production rates varying over three orders of magnitude, at distances
to the nucleus from a few to a few hundred km. To achieve the best possible measurements, cross-calibration
of the plasma instruments is needed. We construct with two different physical models to cross-calibrate
the electron density as measured by the Mutual Impedance Probe (MIP) to the ion current and spacecraft
potential as measured by the Rosetta Langmuir Probe (LAP), the latter validated with the Ion Composition
Analyser (ICA). We retrieve a continuous plasma density dataset for the entire cometary mission
with a much improved dynamical range compared to any plasma instrument alone and, at times, improve
the temporal resolution from 0.24-0.74~Hz to 57.8~Hz. The new density dataset is consistent with
the existing MIP density dataset and covers long time periods where densities were too low to be measured
by MIP. The physical model also yields, at 3~hour time resolution, ion flow speeds as well as a proxy
for the solar EUV flux from the photoemission from the Langmuir Probes. We report on two independent
mission-wide estimates of the ion flow speed which are consistent with the bulk H$_2$O$^+$ ion velocities
as measured by ICA. We find the ion flow to consistently be much faster than the neutral gas over the
entire mission, lending further evidence that the ions are collisionally decoupled from the neutrals
in the coma. RPC measurements of ion speeds are therefore not consistent with the assumptions made
in previously published plasma density models of the comet ionosphere at the start and end of the
mission. Also, the measured EUV flux is perfectly consistent with independently derived values
previously published from Johansson et al. (2017) and lends support for the conclusions drawn therein.

The quantitative measurement of viscoelasticity of nano-scaleentities is an important goal of
nanotechnology research and there is considerable progress with advent of dynamic Atomic Force
Microscopy. The hydrodynamics of cantilever, the force sensor in AFM measurements, plays a pivotal
role in quantitative estimates of nano-scale viscoelasticity. The point-mass model,wherein
the AFM cantilever is approximated as a point mass with mass-less spring is widely used in dynamic
AFM analysis and its validity, particularly in liquid environments, is debated. It is suggested
that the cantilever must be treated as a continuous rectangular beam to obtain accurate estimates
of nano-scale viscoelasticity of materials it is probing. Here, we derived equations, which relate
stiffness and damping coefficient of the material under investigation to measured parameters,
by approximating cantilever as a point mass and also considering the full geometric details. These
equations are derived for both tip-excited as well as base excited cantilevers. We have performed
off-resonance dynamic atomic force spectroscopy on a single protein molecule to investigate the
validity of widely used point-mass model. We performed measurements with AFMs equipped with different
cantilever excitation methods as well as detection schemes to measure cantilever response. The
data was analyzed using both, continuous-beam model and the point-mass model. We found that both
models yield same results when the experiments are performed in truly off-resonance regime with
small amplitudes and the cantilever stiffness is much higher than the interaction stiffness. Our
findings suggest that a simple point-mass approximation based model is adequate to describe the
dynamics, provided care is taken while performing experiments so that the approximations used
in these models are valid.

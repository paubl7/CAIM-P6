The present article investigates the interactions between the pilot and main flames in a novel stratified
swirl burner using both experimental and numerical methods. Experiments are conducted in a test
rig operating at atmospheric conditions. The system is equipped with the BASIS (Beihang Axial Swirler
Independently-Stratified) burner fuelled with premixed methane-air mixtures. To illustrate
the interactions between the pilot and main flames, three operating modes are studied, where the
burner works with: (i) only the pilot flame, (ii) only the main flame, and (iii) the stratified flame
(with both the pilot and main flames). We found that: (1) In the pilot flame mode, the flame changes
from V-shape to M-shape when the main stage is switched from closed to supplying a pure air stream.
Strong oscillations in the M-shape flame are found due to the dilution of the main air to the pilot
methane flame. (2) In the main flame mode, the main flame is lifted off from the burner if the pilot
stage is supplied with air. The temperature of the primary recirculation zone drops substantially
and the unsteady heat release is intensified. (3) In the stratified flame mode, unique beating oscillations
exhibiting dual closely-spaced frequencies in the pressure spectrum. is found. This is observed
within over narrow window of equivalence ratio combinations between the pilot and main stages.
Detailed analysis of the experimental data shows that flame dynamics and thermoacoustic couplings
at these two frequencies are similar to those of the unstable pilot flame and the attached main flame
cases, respectively. Large Eddy Simulations (LESs) are carried out with OpenFOAM to understand
the mechanisms of the time averaged flame shapes in different operating modes. Finally, a simple
acoustic analysis is proposed to understand the acoustic mode nature of the beating oscillations.

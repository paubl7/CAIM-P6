Although spectral surveys and spacecraft missions provide information on small bodies, many important
analyses can only be performed in terrestrial laboratories. For now, the total number of parent
bodies represented in our meteorites collection is estimated to about 150 parent bodies, of which
50 parent bodies represented by the poorly studied ungrouped chondrites. Linking ungrouped meteorites
to their parent bodies is thus crucial to significantly increase our knowledge of asteroids. To
this end, the petrography of 25 ungrouped chondrites and rare meteorite groups was studied, allowing
grouping into 6 petrographic groups based on texture, mineralogy, and aqueous and thermal parent
body processing. Then, we acquired visible-near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy data, in
order to compare them to ground-based telescopic observations of asteroids. The reflectance spectra
of meteorites were obtained on powdered samples, raw samples and polished sections. Our results
showed that sample preparation influences the shape of the spectra, and thus asteroid spectral
matching, especially for carbonaceous chondrites. Overall, the petrographic groups defined
initially coincide with reflectance spectral groups. We define links between some of the studied
ungrouped chondrites and asteroid types that had no meteorite connection proposed before, such
as some very primitive type 3.00 ungrouped chondrites to B-type or Cg-type asteroids. We also matched
metamorphosed ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites to S-complex asteroids, suggesting that this
complex is not only composed of ordinary chondrites or primitive achondrites, as previously established,
but may also host carbonaceous chondrites. Conversely, some ungrouped chondrites could not be
matched to any known asteroid type, showing that those are potential samples from yet unidentified
asteroid types.

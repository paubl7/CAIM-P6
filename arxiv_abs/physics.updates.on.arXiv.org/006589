In this paper we discuss the possibility to generate and accelerate proton nanobeams in fully dielectric
laser-driven accelerators (p-DLAs). High gradient on-chip optical-power dielectric laser accelerators
(DLAs) could represent one of the most promising way towards future miniaturized particle accelerator.
A primary challenge for DLAs are small beam apertures having a size of the order of the driving laser
wavelength where low charge high-repetition (or also CW) ultralow emittance nanobeams have to
be transported. For electrons beams generation and acceleration, intense research activities
are ongoing, and several demonstrations have been already obtained by using electrons nanotip
(or flat photocathode) sources feeding dielectric microstructures. In this article we aim at the
possibility to integrate a nanosource for the generation of a light ion or proton nano-beams suitable
for the subsequent acceleration into sub-relativistic (low-beta) p-DLA stages. Such integration
includes the idea to use a proton dielectric radiofrequency quadrupole (p-DRFQ) for bridging the
gap between the accelerator front-end and the drift-tube and high-beta sections. The paper has
been prepared as a white book including state-of-art technologies and new solutions that now put
the ambitious frontier of a fully nanostructured proton accelerator into reach. Conceptual studies
of p-DLAs here presented could enable table-top proton nano-beams for several applications: proton
beam writing, nuclear reaction analysis at sub-micrometer scales, the construction of miniaturized
Proton-Boron Nuclear Fusion based Reactors, biological analysis at the micrometer scale, ion
beam analysis at the sub-cellular level, mini-beams ion therapy to spare the shallow tissues, proton
irradiation of transistors, compact proton linac for neutron generation.

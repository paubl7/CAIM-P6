Background: Skin marker-based analysis of functional spinal movement is a promising method for
quantifying longitudinal effects of treatment interventions in patients with spinal pathologies.
However, observed day-to-day changes might not necessarily be due to a treatment intervention,
but can result from errors related to soft tissue artifacts, marker placement inaccuracies or biological
day-to-day variability. Research question: How reliable are skin marker-derived three-dimensional
spinal kinematics during functional activities between two separate measurement sessions? Methods:
Twenty healthy adults (11f/9m) were invited to a movement analysis laboratory for two visits separated
by 7-10 days. At each visit, they performed various functional activities (i.e. sitting, standing,
walking, running, chair rising, box lifting and vertical jumping), while marker trajectories
were recorded using a skin marker-based 10-camera optical motion capture system and used to calculate
sagittal and frontal plane spinal curvature angles as well as transverse plane segmental rotational
angles in the lumbar and thoracic regions. Between-session reliability for continuous data and
discrete parameters was determined by analyzing systematic errors using one sample T-tests as
well as by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and minimal detectable changes
(MDCs). Results and Significance: The analysis indicated high relative consistency for sagittal
plane curvature angles during all activities, but not for frontal and transverse plane angles during
walking and running. MDCs were mostly below 15{\deg}, with relative values ranging between 10%
and 750%. This study provides important information that can serve as a basis for researchers and
clinicians aiming at investigating longitudinal effects of treatment interventions on spinal
motion behavior in patients with spinal pathologies.

Surface roughness elements are commonly used in wind tunnel testing to hasten the laminar-turbulent
transition of the boundary layer in model tests to mimic the aerodynamic effects present in the full-scale
application. These devices can alter the characteristics of the turbulent boundary layer, such
as the spanwise correlation length, the boundary layer thickness, etc. This not only affects the
aerodynamic performance but also the aeroacoustic characteristics of the tested model. Few studies
have investigated the effects of surface roughness elements on the trailing edge near- and far-field
noise. So far, the influence of roughness on the wall pressure fluctuations and spanwise coherence
at the trailing edge has been left unexplored. Thus, this research addresses the effects of surface
roughness geometries of different heights on the trailing edge wall pressure fluctuations, the
spanwise coherence, and the far-field noise. Wind tunnel experiments were performed adopting
zigzag strips and novel sharkskin-like surface roughness installed in a NACA 0012 at zero angle
of attack. The tested surface roughness heights ranged from 29% to 233% of the undisturbed boundary
layer thickness. The wall pressure fluctuations and the far-field noise were measured for Reynolds
numbers from 1.3x10^5 to 3.3x10^5. It was observed that the surface roughness affects the low- and
high-frequency range of the wall pressure spectrum, with trip heights in the range from 50% to 110%
of the undisturbed boundary layer thickness having a slight level increase for low frequencies
and no difference for high frequencies. The far-field noise increased for low and high frequencies
as the trip height increased. The low-frequency increase is a consequence of the trip effects on
the trailing edge wall pressure fluctuations, whereas for high frequencies the increase is due
to the noise generated by the trip itself.

With the aim of efficiently simulating three-dimensional multiphase turbulent flows with a phase-field
method, we propose a new discretization scheme for the biharmonic term (the 4th-order derivative
term) of the Cahn-Hilliard equation. This novel scheme can significantly reduce the computational
cost while retaining the same accuracy as the original procedure. Our phase-field method is built
on top of a direct numerical simulation solver, named AFiD (www.afid.eu) and open-sourced by our
research group. It relies on a pencil distributed parallel strategy and a FFT-based Poisson solver.
To deal with large density ratios between the two phases, a pressure split method [1] has been applied
to the Poisson solver. To further reduce computational costs, we implement a multiple-resolution
algorithm which decouples the discretizations for the Navier-Stokes equations and the scalar
equation: while a stretched wall-resolving grid is used for the Navier-Stokes equations, for the
Cahn-Hilliard equation we use a fine uniform mesh. The present method shows excellent computational
performance for large-scale computation: on meshes up to 8 billion nodes and 3072 CPU cores, a multiphase
flow needs only slightly less than 1.5 times the CPU time of the single-phase flow solver on the same
grid. The present method is validated by comparing the results to previous studies for the cases
of drop deformation in shear flow, including the convergence test with mesh refinement, and breakup
of a rising buoyant bubble with density ratio up to 1000. Finally, we simulate the breakup of a big
drop and the coalescence of O(10^3) drops in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection at a Rayleigh
number of $10^8$, observing good agreement with theoretical results.

Purpose: There is growing interest in the use of modern 3D printing technology to implement intensity-modulated
radiation therapy (IMRT) on the preclinical scale which is analogous to clinical IMRT. However,
current 3D-printed IMRT methods suffer from complex modulation patterns leading to long delivery
times, excess filament usage, and inaccurate compensator fabrication. In this work, we have developed
a total variation regularization (TVR) approach to address these issues. Methods: TVR-IMRT, a
technique designed to minimize the intensity difference between neighboring beamlets, was used
to optimize the beamlet intensity map, which was then converted to corresponding compensator thicknesses
in copper-doped PLA filament. IMRT and TVR-IMRT plans using five beams were generated to treat a
mouse heart while sparing lung tissue. The individual field doses and composite dose were delivered
to film and compared to the corresponding planned doses using gamma analysis. Results: TVR-IMRT
reduced the total variation of both the beamlet intensities and compensator thicknesses by around
50% when compared to standard 3D printed compensator IMRT. The total mass of compensator material
consumed and radiation beam-on time were reduced by 20-30%, while DVHs remained comparable. Gamma
analysis passing rate with 3%/0.3mm criterion was 89.07% for IMRT and 95.37% for TVR-IMRT. Conclusion:
TVR can be applied to small animal IMRT beamlet intensities in order to produce fluence maps and subsequent
3D-printed compensator patterns with less total variation, simplifying 3D printing and reducing
the amount of filament required. The TVR-IMRT plan required less beam-on time while maintaining
the dose conformity when compared to a traditional IMRT plan.

Label-free observation of nanoparticles by far-field optical microscopy is challenging because
their ability to scatter or absorb light dramatically diminishes with decreasing size. Surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) imaging have shown promises
and respective limitations. For instance, it is challenging to achieve diffraction-limited resolution
in SPR imaging; its refractive index sensitivity is not as localized as desired. LSPR imaging is
typically employed with dark-field microscopy on sparse noble metal nanostructures, leading
to low light throughput and incomplete imaging. Here we demonstrate ultra near-field index modulated
PlAsmonic NanO-apeRture lAbel-free iMAging (PANORAMA) that addresses existing issues for both
SPR and LSPR imaging. PANORAMA produces diffraction-limited lateral resolution with higher surface
sensitivity compared to SPR. Its system configuration is identical to a standard bright-field
microscope using a trans-illumination tungsten-halogen lamp instead of a laser or other high-intensity
light sources. Additionally, PANORAMA addresses the sparse sampling issue in LSPR imaging by achieving
dense sampling with a large imaging fill factor. The bright-field approach provides much higher
light throughput compared to dark-field microscopy. Overall, our technique can provide a panoramic
view both laterally and longitudinally - overcoming the lack of imaging depth for both SPR and LSPR
imaging and the insufficient lateral sampling for LSPR imaging. We have demonstrated that PANORAMA
can size single nanoparticle down to 25 nm, count individual nanoparticles in a cluster, and dynamically
monitor single nanoparticle approaching the plasmonic surface down to the millisecond timescale.
PANORAMA is potentially useful in single biological nanoparticle analysis of exosomes and viruses.

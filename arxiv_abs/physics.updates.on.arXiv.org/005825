Narrow linewidth visible light lasers are critical for atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) applications
including atomic clocks, quantum computing, atomic and molecular spectroscopy, and sensing.
Historically, such lasers are implemented at the tabletop scale, using semiconductor lasers stabilized
to large optical reference cavities. Photonic integration of high spectral-purity visible light
sources will enable experiments to increase in complexity and scale. Stimulated Brillouin scattering
(SBS) is a promising approach to realize highly coherent on-chip visible light laser emission.
While progress has been made on integrated SBS lasers at telecommunications wavelengths, barriers
have existed to translate this performance to the visible, namely the realization of Brillouin-active
waveguides in ultra-low optical loss photonics. We have overcome this barrier, demonstrating
the first visible light photonic integrated SBS laser, which operates at 674 nm to address the 88Sr+
optical clock transition. To guide the laser design, we use a combination of multi-physics simulation
and Brillouin spectroscopy in a 2 meter spiral waveguide to identify the 25.110 GHz first order Stokes
frequency shift and 290 MHz gain bandwidth. The laser is implemented in an 8.9 mm radius silicon nitride
all-waveguide resonator with 1.09 dB per meter loss and Q of 55.4 Million. Lasing is demonstrated,
with an on-chip 14.7 mW threshold, a 45% slope efficiency, and linewidth narrowing as the pump is
increased from below threshold to 269 Hz. To illustrate the wavelength flexibility of this design,
we also demonstrate lasing at 698 nm, the wavelength for the optical clock transition in neutral
strontium. This demonstration of a waveguide-based, photonic integrated SBS laser that operates
in the visible, and the reduced size and sensitivity to environmental disturbances, shows promise
for diverse AMO applications.

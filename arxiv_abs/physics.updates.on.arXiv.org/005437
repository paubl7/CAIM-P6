A numerical modeling study based on 3D finite element method (FEM) simulation and 1D analytical
solutions has been carried out to evaluate the capabilities of two ac methods for measuring in-plane
thermal conductivity of thin film deposited on the back of a suspended SiNx membrane setup. Two parallel
metal strips are present on the top of the dielectric membrane. One strip (S1) serves as both heater
and thermometer, while another one (S2) acts as thermometer only. For a modified phase shift (MPS)
method, it is crucial to extract the in-plane thermal diffusivity from the phase shift of the temperature
oscillation on S2. It was found that the frequency window for carrying out the data fitting became
narrower as the in-plane thermal diffusivity of the composite membrane (${\alpha_{\parallel
,C}}$) increased, primarily due to the failure of the semi-infinite width assumption in the low
frequency region. To ensure the validity of the method, the upper limit of ${\alpha_{\parallel
,C}}$ should not exceed ~1.8$ \times $10-5 m2 s-1 for the specific membrane dimension under consideration
(1$\times $1 mm2). On the other hand, inspired by a modified Angstrom method proposed by Zhu recently,
we suggest a new data reduction methodology which takes advantage of the phase shift on both S1 and
S2 as well as the amplitude on S1. Based on the simulation results, it is expected that the non-ideality
associated with the three observables may be at least partially cancelled out.Therefore, the frequency
window selection for carrying out the data fitting is not sensitive to the magnitude of ${\alpha_{\parallel
,C}}$. For typical specimen films whose in-plane thermal conductivity ranges from 0.84 W m-1 K-1
to 50 W m-1 K-1, the method proposed here yields a theoretical measurement uncertainty of less than
5%.

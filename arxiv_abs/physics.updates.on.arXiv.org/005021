The aim of the present study is to perform a theoretical analysis of different strategies to stabilize
energetic-ion-driven resistive interchange mode (EIC) in LHD plasma. We use a reduced MHD for the
thermal plasma coupled with a gyrofluid model for the energetic particles (EP) species. The hellically
trapped EP component is introduced through a modification of the drift frequency to include their
precessional drift. The stabilization trends of the 1/1 EIC observed experimentally with respect
to the thermal plasma density and temperature are reproduced by the simulations, showing a reasonable
agreement with the data. The LHD operation scenarios with stable 1/1 EIC are identified, leading
to the stabilization of the 1/1 EIC if the thermal plasma density and temperature are above a given
threshold. The 1/1 EIC are also stabilized if the rotational transform is modified in a way that the
1/1 rational surface is located further away than 0.9 times the normalized radius, or the magnetic
shear in the plasma periphery is enhanced. Also, LHD discharges with large magnetic fields show
a higher EIC destabilization threshold with respect to the thermal plasma density. If the perpendicular
NBI deposition region is moved further inward than 0.875 times the normalized radius the 1/1 EIC
are also stabilized. In addition, increasing the perpendicular NBI voltage such that the EP energy
is higher than 30 keV stabilizes the 1/1 EIC. Moreover, Deuterium plasmas show a higher stability
threshold for the 1/1 EIC than Hydrogen plasmas. The experimental data shows a larger time interval
between EIC events as the power of the tangential NBI is increased providing that the perpendicular
NBI power is at least 13 MW. This implies a stabilizing effect of the tangential NBI.

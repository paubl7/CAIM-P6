Three-dimensional (3D) instabilities on a (potentially turbulent) two-dimensional (2D) flow
are still incompletely understood, despite recent progress. Here, based on known physical properties
of such 3-D instabilities, we propose a simple, energy-conserving model describing this situation.
It consists of a 2D point-vortex flow coupled to localized 3D perturbations (ergophages), such
that ergophages can gain energy by altering vortex-vortex distances through an induced divergent
velocity field, thus decreasing point-vortex energy. We investigate the model in three distinct
stages of evolution: (i) The linear regime, where the ergophage amplitude grows or decays exponentially
on average, with a randomly fluctuating instantaneous growth rate. The growth rate has a small auto-correlation
time, and follows a probability distribution featuring a power-law tail with exponent between
-2 and -5/3 (up to a cut-off), depending on the point-vortex base flow. Consequently, the logarithmic
ergophage amplitude performs a free L\'evy flight. (ii) The passive-nonlinear regime of the model,
where the 2D flow evolves independently of the ergophage amplitudes, which saturate by non-linear
self-interactions without affecting the 2D flow. In this regime the system exhibits a new type of
on-off intermittency that we name L\'evy on-off intermittency, and which we study in a companion
paper. We compute the bifurcation diagram for the mean and variance of the perturbation amplitude,
as well as the probability density of the perturbation amplitude. (iii) Finally, we characterize
the the fully nonlinear regime, where ergophages feed back on the 2D flow, and study how the vortex
temperature is altered by the interaction with ergophages. It is shown that when the amplitude of
the ergophages is sufficiently large, the 2D flow saturates to a zero-temperature state. Given
the limitations of existing theories ...

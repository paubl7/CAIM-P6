A new mathematical analysis of exhaled respiratory droplet dynamics and settling distances in
the vicinity of vortical environments is presented. Recent experimental and theoretical studies
suggest that vortical flow structures may enhance the settling distances of exhaled respiratory
droplets beyond the two-meter distancing rule recommended by health authorities lately. We propose
a mathematical framework to study the underlying physical mechanism responsible for the entrapment
and subsequently delayed settling times of evaporating droplets and solid particles. A dipolar
vortex is considered self-propelling through a cloud of micron-sized evaporating droplets. This
configuration may represent a number of indoor and outdoor environments in which similar unsteady
vortical flow structures may interact with exhaled respiratory droplets. % We demonstrate the
vortex dipole effect on droplet and solid particles settling distances, depending on the evaporation
rate, the vorticity of the dipole, and the droplet's initial diameter and location relative to the
vortex core. % Our theoretical analysis reveals non-intuitive interactions between the vortex
dipole, droplet relaxation time, gravity, and mass transfer. The existence of optimal conditions
for maximum displacement is suggested, where the droplet entrainment reaches up to an order of magnitude
larger than the vortex core length scale. % We present a basic model that may be applied for evaluating
the spread of exhaled respiratory droplets in vortical environments. Our theoretical study suggests
that exhaled respiratory droplets initially at rest can translate to significant distances, hence
implying that vortical flow might enhance the transmission of airborne pathogens.

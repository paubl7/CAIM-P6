This paper proposes a very simple deterministic mathematical model, which, by using a power-law,
is a \emph{non-integer power model} (or \emph{fractional power model (FPM)}). Such a model, in
non-integer power of time, namely $t^m$ up to constants, enables representing at each day, with
a good precision, the totality of the contaminated individuals. Despite being enriched with knowledge
through an internal structure based on a geometric sequence "with variable ratio", the model (in
its non-integer representation) has only three parameters, among which the non-integer power,
$m$, that determines on its own, according to its value, an aggravation or an improvement of the viral
spreading. Its simplicity comes from the power-law, $t^m$, which simply expresses the singular
dynamics of the operator of non-integer differentiation or integration, of high parametric compactness,
that governs diffusion phenomena and, as shown in this paper, the spreading phenomena by contamination.
The proposed model is indeed validated with the official data of Ministry of Health on the COVID-19
spreading. Used in prediction, it well enables justifying the choice of a lockdown, without which
the spreading would have highly worsened. The comparison of this model in $t^m$ with two known models
having the same number of parameters, well shows that its representativity of the real data is better
or more general. Finally, in a more fundamental context and particularly in terms of complexity
and simplicity, a self-filtering action enables showing the compatibility between the \emph{internal
complexity} that the internal structure and its stochastic behavior present, and the \emph{global
simplicity} that the model in $t^m$ offers in a deterministic manner: it is true that the non-integer
power of a power-law is well a marker of complexity.

From the nano-scale to the macro-scale, biological tissue is spatially heterogeneous. Even when
tissue behavior is well understood, the exact subject specific spatial distribution of material
properties is often unknown. And, when developing computational models of biological tissue,
it is usually prohibitively computationally expensive to simulate every plausible spatial distribution
of material properties for each problem of interest. Therefore, one of the major challenges in developing
accurate computational models of biological tissue is capturing the potential effects of this
spatial heterogeneity. Recently, machine learning based metamodels have gained popularity as
a computationally tractable way to overcome this problem because they can make predictions based
on a limited number of direct simulation runs. These metamodels are promising, but they often still
require a high number of direct simulations to achieve an acceptable performance. Here we show that
transfer learning, a strategy where knowledge gained while solving one problem is transferred
to solving a different but related problem, can help overcome this limitation. Critically, transfer
learning can be used to leverage both low-fidelity simulation data and simulation data that is the
outcome of solving a different but related mechanical problem. In this paper, we extend Mechanical
MNIST, our open source benchmark dataset of heterogeneous material undergoing large deformation,
to include a selection of low-fidelity simulation results that require 2-4 orders of magnitude
less CPU time to run. Then, we show that transferring the knowledge stored in metamodels trained
on these low-fidelity simulation results can vastly improve the performance of metamodels used
to predict the results of high-fidelity simulations.

The mechanistic underpinnings of asymmetric catalysis at atomic levels provide shortcuts for
developing the potential value of chiral catalysts beyond the current state-of-the-art. In the
enantioselective redox transformations, the present intuition-driven studies require a systematic
approach to support their intuitive idea. Arguably, the most systematic approach would be based
on the reliable quantitative structure-selectivity relationship of diverse and dissimilar chiral
scaffolds in an optimal feature space that is universally applied to reactions. Here, we introduce
a predictive workflow for the extension of the reaction scope of chiral catalysts across name reactions.
For this purpose, whole geometry descriptors were encoded from DFT optimized 3D structures of multiple
catalyst scaffolds, 113 catalysts in 9 clusters. The molecular descriptors were verified by the
statistical comparison of the enantioselective predictive classification models built from
each descriptors of chiral iodoarenes. More notably, capturing the whole molecular geometry through
one hot encoding of split three-dimensional molecular fingerprints presented reliable enantioselective
predictive regression models for three different name reactions by recycling the data and metadata
obtained across reactions. The potential use value of this workflow and the advantages of recyclability,
compatibility, and generality proved that the workflow can be applied for name reactions other
than the aforementioned name reactions (out of samples). Furthermore, for the consensus prediction
of ensemble models, this global descriptor can be compared with sterimol parameters and noncovalent
interaction vectors. This study is one case showing how to overcome the sparsity of experimental
data in organic reactions, especially asymmetric catalysis.

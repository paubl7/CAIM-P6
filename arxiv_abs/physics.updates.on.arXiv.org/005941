Quantum geometry has been identified as an important ingredient for the physics of quantum materials
and especially of flat-band systems, such as moir\'e materials. On the other hand, the coupling
between light and matter is of key importance across disciplines and especially for Floquet and
cavity engineering of solids. Here we present fundamental relations between light-matter coupling
and quantum geometry of Bloch wave functions, with a particular focus on flat-band and moir\'e materials,
in which the quenching of the electronic kinetic energy could allow one to reach the limit of strong
light-matter coupling more easily than in highly dispersive systems. We show that, despite the
fact that flat bands have vanishing band velocities and curvatures, light couples to them via geometric
contributions. Specifically, the intra-band quantum metric allows diamagnetic coupling inside
a flat band; the inter-band Berry connection governs dipole matrix elements between flat and dispersive
bands. We illustrate these effects in two representative model systems: (i) a sawtooth quantum
chain with a single flat band, and (ii) a tight-binding model for twisted bilayer graphene. For (i)
we highlight the importance of quantum geometry by demonstrating a nonvanishing diamagnetic light-matter
coupling inside the flat band. For (ii) we explore the twist-angle dependence of various light-matter
coupling matrix elements. Furthermore, at the magic angle corresponding to almost flat bands,
we show a Floquet-topological gap opening under irradiation with circularly polarized light despite
the nearly vanishing Fermi velocity. We discuss how these findings provide fundamental design
principles and tools for light-matter-coupling-based control of emergent electronic properties
in flat-band and moir\'e materials.

The behavior of electromagnetic waves in chirally twisted structures is a topic of enduring interest,
dating back at least to the invention in the 1940s of the microwave travelling wave tube amplifier
and culminating in contemporary studies of chiral metamaterials, metasurfaces, and photonic
crystal fibers (PCFs). Optical fibers with chiral microstructures, drawn from a spinning preform,
have many useful properties, exhibiting for example circular birefringence and circular dichroism.
It has recently been shown that chiral fibers with N fold rotationally symmetric (symmetry group
CN) transverse microstructures support families of helical Bloch modes (HBMs), each of which consists
of a superposition of azimuthal Bloch harmonics (or optical vortices). An example is a fiber with
N coupled cores arranged in a ring around its central axis (N core single ring fiber). Although this
type of fiber can be readily modelled using scalar coupled mode theory, a full description of its
optical properties requires a vectorial analysis that takes account of the polarization state
of the light particularly important in studies of circular and vortical birefringence. In this
paper we develop, using an orthogonal two dimensional helicoidal coordinate system embedded in
a cylindrical surface at constant radius, a rigorous vector coupled mode description of the fields
using local Frenet Serret frames that rotate and twist with each of the N cores. The analysis places
on a firm theoretical footing a previous HBM theory in which a heuristic approach was taken, based
on physical intuition of the properties of Bloch waves. We believe this study provides clarity in
what can sometimes be a rather difficult field, and will facilitate further exploration of real-world
applications of these fascinating waveguiding systems.

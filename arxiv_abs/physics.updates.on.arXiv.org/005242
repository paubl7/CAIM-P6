Slow magnetoacoustic waves are routinely observed in astrophysical plasma systems such as the
solar corona. As a slow wave propagates through a plasma, it modifies the equilibrium quantities
of density, temperature, and magnetic field. In the corona and other plasma systems, the thermal
equilibrium is comprised of a balance between continuous heating and cooling processes, the magnitudes
of which vary with density, temperature and magnetic field. Thus the wave may induce a misbalance
between these competing processes. Its back reaction on the wave has been shown to lead to dispersion,
and amplification or damping, of the wave. In this work the importance of the effect of magnetic field
in the rapid damping of slow waves in the solar corona by heating/cooling misbalance is evaluated
and compared to the effects of thermal conduction. The two timescales characterising the effect
of misbalance are derived and calculated for plasma systems with a range of typical coronal conditions.
The predicted damping times of slow waves from thermal misbalance in the solar corona are found to
be of the order of 10-100 minutes, coinciding with the wave periods and damping times observed. Moreover
the slow wave damping by thermal misbalance is found to be comparable to the damping by field-aligned
thermal conduction. We show that in the infinite field limit, the wave dynamics is insensitive to
the dependence of the heating function on the magnetic field, and this approximation is found to
be valid in the corona so long as the magnetic field strength is greater than 10G for quiescent loops
and plumes and 100G for hot and dense loops. In summary thermal misbalance may damp slow magnetoacoustic
waves rapidly in much of the corona, and its inclusion in our understanding of slow mode damping may
resolve discrepancies between observations and theory relying on compressive viscosity and thermal
conduction alone.

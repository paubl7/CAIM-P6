Positrons bind to molecules leading to vibrational excitation and spectacularly enhanced annihilation.
Whilst positron binding energies have been measured via resonant annihilation spectra for $\sim$90
molecules in the past two decades, an accurate \emph{ab initio} theoretical description has remained
elusive. Of the molecules studied experimentally, calculations exist for only 6, and for these,
standard quantum chemistry approaches have proved severely deficient, agreeing with experiment
to at best 25% accuracy for polar molecules, and failing to predict binding in nonpolar molecules.
The mechanisms of binding are not understood. Here, we develop a many-body theory of positron-molecule
interactions and uncover the role of strong many-body correlations including polarization of
the electron cloud, screening of the positron-electron Coulomb interaction by molecular electrons,
and crucially, the unique non-perturbative process of virtual-positronium formation (where
a molecular electron temporarily tunnels to the positron): they dramatically enhance binding
in polar molecules and enable binding in nonpolars. We also elucidate the role of individual molecular
orbitals, highlighting the importance of electronic $\pi$ bonds. Overall, we calculate binding
energies in agreement with experiment (to within 1% in cases), and we predict binding in formamide
and nucleobases. As well as supporting resonant annihilation experiments and positron-based
molecular spectroscopy, the approach can be extended to positron scattering and annihilation
$\gamma$ spectra in molecules and condensed matter, to provide fundamental insight and predictive
capability required to properly interpret materials science diagnostics, develop antimatter-based
technologies (including positron traps, beams and positron emission tomography), and understand
positrons in the galaxy.

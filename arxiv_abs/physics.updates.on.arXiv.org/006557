A photonic-assisted multi-functional radar system for simultaneous distance and velocity measurement
and high-resolution microwave imaging is proposed and experimentally demonstrated by using a
composite transmitted microwave signal of a single-chirped linearly frequency-modulated (LFM)
signal and a single-tone microwave signal. In the system, the transmitted signal is generated via
photonic frequency up-conversion based on a single integrated dual-polarization dual-parallel
Mach-Zehnder modulator (DPol-DPMZM), whereas the echo signals scattered from the target are de-chirped
to two low-frequency signals using a microwave photonic frequency mixer. By using the two low-frequency
de-chirped signals, the real-time distance and radial velocity of the moving target can be measured
accurately according to the round-trip time of the echo signal and its Doppler frequency shift.
Compared with the previous reported distance and velocity measurement methods, where two LFM signals
with opposite chirps are used, these parameters can be obtained using only a single-chirped LFM
signal and a single-tone microwave signal. Meanwhile, high-resolution inverse synthetic aperture
radar (ISAR) imaging can also be realized using ISAR imaging algorithms. An experiment is performed
to verify the proposed multi-functional microwave photonic radar system. An up-chirped LFM signal
from 8.5 to 12.5 GHz and an 8.0 GHz single-tone microwave signal are used as the transmitted signal.
The results show that the absolute measurement errors of distance and radial velocity are less than
5.9 cm and 2.8 cm/s, respectively. ISAR imaging results are also demonstrated, which proves the
high-resolution and real-time ISAR imaging ability of the proposed system.

Seismic observations of a slowdown in P wave velocity at the base of Earth's outer core suggest the
presence of a stably-stratified region known as the F-layer. This raises an important question:
how can light elements that drive the geodynamo pass through the stably-stratified layer without
disturbing it? We consider the F-layer as a slurry containing solid particles dispersed within
the liquid iron alloy that snow under gravity towards the inner core. We present a regime diagram
showing how the dynamics of the slurry F-layer change upon varying the key parameters: P\'eclet
number ($Pe$), the ratio between advection and chemical diffusion; Stefan number ($St$), the ratio
between sensible and latent heat; and Lewis number ($Le$), the ratio between thermal and chemical
diffusivity. We obtain four regimes corresponding to stable, partially stable, unstable and no
slurries. No slurry is found when the heat flow at the base of the layer exceeds the heat flow at the
top, while a stably-stratified slurry arises when advection overcomes thermal diffusion ($Pe
\gtrsim Le$) that exists over a wide range of parameters relevant to the Earth's core. Our results
estimate that a stably-stratified F-layer gives a maximum inner-core boundary (ICB) body wave
density jump of $\Delta \rho_\textrm{bod} \leq 534 \ \mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{-3}$ which is compatible
with the lower end of the seismic observations where $280 \leq \Delta \rho_\textrm{bod} \leq 1,100
\ \mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{-3}$ is reported in the literature. With high thermal conductivity
the model predicts an inner core age between $0.6$ and $1.2 \ \mathrm{Ga}$, which is consistent with
other core evolution models. Our results suggest that a slurry model with high core conductivity
predicts geophysical properties of the F-layer and core that are consistent with independent seismic
and geodynamic calculations.

Erroneous GNSS positioning, failures in spacecraft operations and power outages due to geomagnetically
induced currents are severe threats originating from space weather. Having knowledge of potential
impacts on modern society in advance is key for many end-user applications. This covers not only
the timing of severe geomagnetic storms but also predictions of substorm onsets at polar latitudes.
In this study we aim at contributing to the timing problem of space weather impacts and propose a new
method to predict the solar wind propagation delay between Lagrangian point L1 and the Earth based
on machine learning, specifically decision tree models. The propagation delay is measured from
the identification of interplanetary discontinuities detected by the Advanced Composition Explorer
(ACE) and their subsequent sudden commencements in the magnetosphere recorded by ground-based
magnetometers. A database of the propagation delay has been constructed on this principle including
380 interplanetary shocks. The feature set consists of six features, the three components of each
the solar wind speed and position of ACE around L1. The machine learning results are compared to the
flat propagation delay and the method based on the normal vector of solar wind discontinuities (vector
delay). The ML model achieves an RMSE of 4.5 min with respect to the measured solar wind propagation
delay and also outperforms the physical flat and vector delay models by 50 \% and 15 \% respectively.
To increase the confidence in the predictions of the trained GB model, we perform a performance validation,
provide feature importance and analyse the feature impact on the model output with Shapley values.
The major advantage of the machine learning approach is its simplicity when it comes to its application.
After training, input from only one ACE datapoint have to be fed into the algorithm for a prediction.

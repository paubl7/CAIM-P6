In a cross-field (ExB) setup, the electron ExB flow relative to the unmagnetized ions can cause the
Electron Cyclotron Drift Instability (ECDI) due to resonances of the ion-acoustic mode and the
electron cyclotron harmonics. This occurs in collisionless shocks in magnetospheres and in ExB
discharge devices such as Hall thrusters. ECDI induces an electron flow parallel to the background
E field at a speed greatly exceeding predictions by classical collision theory. Such anomalous
transport might cause unfavorable plasma flows towards the walls of ExB devices. Prediction of
ECDI and anomalous transport is often thought to require a fully kinetic treatment. In this work,
however, we demonstrate that a reduced variant of this instability, and more importantly, the anomalous
transport, can be treated self-consistently in a collisionless two-fluid framework without any
adjustable collision parameter, by treating both electron and ion species on an equal footing.
We will first present linear analyses of the instability in the two-fluid 5- and 10-moment models,
and compare them against the fully kinetic theory. At low temperatures, the two-fluid models predict
the fastest-growing mode comparable to the kinetic results. Also, by including more moments, secondary
(and possibly higher) unstable branches can be recovered. The dependence of the instability on
ion-to-electron mass ratio, plasma temperature, and the background field strength is also thoroughly
explored. We then carry out 5-moment simulations of the cross-field setup. The development of the
instability and the anomalous transport are confirmed and in excellent agreement with theoretical
predictions. The force balance properties are also studied. This work casts new insights into the
nature of ECDI and the induced anomalous transport and demonstrates the potential of the two-fluid
moment model in the efficient modeling of ExB plasmas.

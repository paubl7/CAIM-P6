In this work we suggest (in a formal analogy with Linde chaotic inflation scenario) simple dynamical
model of the dark energy or cosmological constant. Concretely, we suggest a Lagrangian dependent
of Universe scale factor and scalar field (with constant and positive total energy density as cosmological
constant). Then, Euler-Lagrange equation for Universe scale factor is equivalent to the second
Friedman equation for the flat empty space with cosmological constant (in this sense our model is
full agreement with recent astronomical observations). Also there is Euler-Lagrange equation
for scalar field that includes additional "friction" term and negative first partial derivative
of unknown potential energy density (this equation is, in some way, similar to Klein-Gordon equation
modified for cosmic expansion in Linde chaotic inflation scenario). Finally, total time derivative
of the (constant) scalar field total energy density must be zero. It implies third dynamical equation
which is equivalent to usual Euler-Lagrange equation with positive partial derivative of unknown
potential energy density (this equation is formally exactly equivalent to corresponding equation
in static Universe). Last two equations admit simple exact determination of scalar field and potential
energy density, while cosmological constant stands a "free parameter". Potential energy density
represents a square function of scalar field with unique maximum (dynamically non-stable point).
Any initial scalar field tends (co-exponentially) during time toward the same final scalar field,
argument of the maximum of the potential energy density. It admits a possibility that final dynamically
non-stable scalar field value turns out spontaneously in any other scalar field value when all begins
again (like Sisyphus boulder motion).

Revealing spatiotemporal evolution regularity in the spatial diffusion of epidemics is helpful
for preventing and controlling the spread of epidemics. Based on the real-time COVID-19 datasets
by prefecture-level cities and date, this paper is aimed at exploring the multifractal scaling
in spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19 pandemic and its evolution characteristics in Chinese
mainland. The ArcGIS technology and box-counting method are employed to extract spatial data and
the least square calculation is used to calculate fractal parameters. The results show multifractal
distribution of COVID-19 pandemic in China. The generalized correlation dimension spectrums
are inverse S-shaped curves, but the fractal dimension values significantly exceeds the Euclidean
dimension of embedding space when moment order q<<0. The local singularity spectrums are asymmetric
unimodal curves, which slant to right. The fractal dimension growth curves are shown as quasi S-shaped
curves. From these spectrums and growth curves, the main conclusions can be drawn as follows. First,
self-similar patterns developed in the process of Covid-19 pandemic, which seem be dominated by
multi-scaling law. Second, the spatial pattern of COVID-19 across China can be characterized by
global clustering with local disordered diffusion. Third, the spatial diffusion process of COVID-19
in China experienced four stages, i.e., initial stage, the rapid diffusion stage, the hierarchical
diffusion stage, and finally the contraction stage. This study suggests that multifractal theory
can be utilized to characterize spatio-temporal diffusion of COVID-19 pandemic, and the case analyses
may be instructive for further exploring natural laws of spatial diffusion.

Second-order nonlinear optical processes are used to convert light from one wavelength to another
and to generate quantum entanglement. Creating chip-scale devices to more efficiently realize
and control these interactions greatly increases the reach of photonics. Optical crystals and
guided wave devices made from lithium niobate and potassium titanyl phosphate are typically used
to realize second-order processes but face significant drawbacks in scalability, power, and tailorability
when compared to emerging integrated photonic systems. Silicon or silicon nitride integrated
photonic circuits enhance and control the third-order optical nonlinearity by confining light
in dispersion-engineered waveguides and resonators. An analogous platform for second-order
nonlinear optics remains an outstanding challenge in photonics. It would enable stronger interactions
at lower power and reduce the number of competing nonlinear processes that emerge. Here we demonstrate
efficient frequency doubling and parametric oscillation in a thin-film lithium niobate photonic
circuit. Our device combines recent progress on periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate
waveguidesand low-loss microresonators. Here we realize efficient >10% second-harmonic generation
and parametric oscillation with microwatts of optical power using a periodically-poled thin-film
lithium niobate microresonator. The operating regimes of this system are controlled using the
relative detuning of the intracavity resonances. During nondegenerate oscillation, the emission
wavelength is tuned over terahertz by varying the pump frequency by 100's of megahertz. We observe
highly-enhanced effective third-order nonlinearities caused by cascaded second-order processes
resulting in parametric oscillation. These resonant second-order nonlinear circuits will form
a crucial part of the emerging nonlinear and quantum photonics platforms.

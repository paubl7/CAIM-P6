The present contribution proposes a universal framework to formulate generalized section-section
interaction potentials (SSIP) in the geometrically exact beam theory and to derive the resulting
section-section interaction force and moment laws in a variationally consistent manner. By exploiting
the fundamental kinematic assumption of undeformable cross-sections, a description of section-section
relative configurations via a minimal set of six (translational and rotational) relative coordinates
is proposed. Based on work-pairing and the definition of section-section interaction forces and
moments, a pair of objective (translational and rotational) deformation measures, either in spatial
or in material form, is identified, which in turn allows for the definition of objective (i.e., frame-invariant)
SSIP laws and an associated variational principle. As main application area for this theory, the
modeling of inter-molecular interactions (e.g., due to electrostatic, van der Waals or repulsive
steric forces) between slender fibers based on the geometrically exact beam theory is considered.
Interestingly, it is shown that the force and moment stress resultants as well as the work-conjugated
deformation measures of the well-known Simo-Reissner beam theory can be identified as a special
case of this general framework, where the interaction potential represents an internal stored-energy
function and the interacting cross-sections are located at neighboring arc-length positions
on one and the same beam. While originally derived for inter-molecular interactions, the proposed
variational problem formulation is demonstrated to be of a very general nature, thus also allowing
for the formulation of translational and rotational constraints between arbitrarily oriented
cross-sections based on a penalty potential.

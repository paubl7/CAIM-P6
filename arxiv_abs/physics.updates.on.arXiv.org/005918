Dynamical scenarios of terrestrial planets formation involve strong perturbations of the inner
part of the solar system by the giant-planets, leading to enhanced impact velocities and subsequent
collisional erosion. We quantitatively estimate the effect of collisional erosion on the resulting
composition of Earth, and estimate how it may provide information on the dynamical context of its
formation. We simulate and quantify the erosion of Earth's crust in the context of Solar System formation
scenarios, including the classical model and Grand Tack scenario that invokes orbital migration
of Jupiter during the gaseous disk phase (Walsh et al., 2011; Raymond et al., 2018). We find that collisional
erosion of the early crust is unlikely to produce an excess of about 6% of the Sm/Nd ratio in terrestrial
rock samples compared to chondrites for most simulations. Only Grand Tack simulations in which
the last giant impact on Earth occurred later than 50 million years after the start of Solar System
formation can account for such an offset. However, this time frame is consistent with current cosmochemical
and dynamical estimates of the Moon forming impact (Chyba, 1991; Walker, 2009; Touboul et al.,2007,
2009, 2015; Pepin and Porcelli, 2006; Norman et al., 2003; Nyquist et al., 2006; Boyet et al.,2015).
Such a late fractionation in the Sm/Nd ratio is unlikely to be responsible for a 20-ppm $^{142}$Nd
excess in terrestrial rocks due to the half life of the radiogenic system. Additionally, such a large
and late fractionation in the Sm/Nd ratio would accordingly induce non-observed anomalies in the
$^{143}$Nd/$^{144}$Nd ratio. Considering our results, the Grand Tack model with a late Moon-forming
impact cannot be easily reconciled with the Nd isotopic Earth contents.

Histological visualizations are critical to clinical disease management and are fundamental
to biological understanding. However, current approaches that rely on bright-field microscopy
require extensive tissue preparation prior to imaging. These processes are labor intensive and
contribute to delays in clinical feedback that can extend to two to three weeks for standard paraffin-embedded
tissue preparation and interpretation. Here, we present a label-free reflection-mode imaging
modality that reveals cellular-scale morphology by detecting intrinsic endogenous contrast.
We accomplish this with the novel photoacoustic remote sensing (PARS) detection system that permits
non-contact optical absorption contrast to be extracted from thick and opaque biological targets
with optical resolution. PARS was examined both as a rapid assessment tool that is capable of managing
large samples (>1 cm2) in under 10 minutes, and as a high contrast imaging modality capable of extracting
specific biological contrast to simulate conventional histological stains such as hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E). The capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated in a variety of human tissue
preparations including formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks and unstained slides
sectioned from these blocks, including normal and neoplastic human brain, and breast epithelium
involved with breast cancer. Similarly, PARS images of human skin prepared by frozen section clearly
demonstrated basal cell carcinoma and normal human skin tissue. Finally, we imaged unprocessed
murine kidney and achieved histologically relevant subcellular morphology in fresh tissue. This
represents a vital step towards an effective real-time clinical microscope that overcomes the
limitations of standard histopathologic tissue preparations and enables real-time pathology
assessment.

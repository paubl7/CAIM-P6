The thermal conductivity of double-stranded (ds) B-DNA was systematically investigated using
classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The effect of changing base-pairs on the thermal
conductivity of dsDNA, needed investigation at a molecular level. Hence, four sequences, viz.
poly(A), poly(G), poly(CG) and poly(AT) were initially analysed in this work. Firstly, length
of these sequences was varied from 4-40 base-pairs (bp) at 300 K and the respective thermal conductivity
($\mathrm{\kappa}$) was computed. Secondly, the temperature dependent thermal conductivities
between 100 K and 400 K were obtained in 50 K steps at 28 bp length. The M\"{u}ller-Plathe reverse non-equilibrium
molecular dynamics (RNEMD) was employed to set a thermal gradient and obtain all thermal conductivities
in this work. Moreover, mixed sequences using AT and CG sequencces, namely $\mathrm{A(CG)_{n}T}$
(n=3-7), $\mathrm{ACGC(AT)_{m}GCGT}$ (m=0-5) and $\mathrm{ACGC(AT)_{n}AGCGT}$ (n=1-4) were
investigated based on the hypothesis that these sequences could be better thermoelectrics. 1-dimensional
lattices are said to have diverging thermal conductivities at longer lengths, which violate Fourier
law. These follow power law, where $\mathrm{\kappa \propto\ L^{\beta}}$. At longer lengths, the
exponent $\mathrm{\beta}$ need to satisfy the condition $\mathrm{\beta}>1/3$ for divergent
thermal conductivity. We find no such significant Fourier law violation through divergence of
thermal conductivities at 80 bp lengths or 40 bp lengths. Also, in the case of second study, the presence
of short (m$\le$2) encapsulated AT sequences within CG sequences show an increasing trend. These
significant results are important for engineering DNA based thermal devices.

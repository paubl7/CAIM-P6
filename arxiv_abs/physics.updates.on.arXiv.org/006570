Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are highly-sensitive photodetectors emerging as the technology
of choice for many applications, including large high-energy physics experiments where they often
are exposed to high radiation fluences. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in
assessing the performance deterioration of such detectors after the irradiation with proton or
neutron, with different fluence levels. In this work, samples of different FBK SiPM technologies,
made with different manufacturing technologies, were irradiated at the INFN-LNS facility (Italy)
with protons reaching fluences up to $10^{12}n_{eq}/mm^2$ (1 MeV neutron equivalent) which correspond
$10^{14}n_{eq}/cm^2$ to and their performances were characterized in detail after an approximately
30 days room temperature annealing. The results show a significant worsening of the primary noise
(dark count rate) of the detectors, which increases with the irradiation dose, whereas the other
performance parameters like the micro-cell gain, the correlated noise probability and the photon
detection efficiency do not show significant variations over the investigated dose range. The
breakdown voltage estimation after irradiation is another important aspect for a SiPM. In this
contribution, we show several methods for its estimation and compare the results. We also introduced
new methodologies to characterize the performance of the SiPMs when they present a very high level
of noise. Lastly, we also analyzed the spatial localization of the proton-induced defects inside
the device, i.e. the defects that mostly contribute to the increase of the DCR of the device, through
the emission microscopy (EMMI) technique. In particular, we analyzed the SiPMs at the single cell
level, trying to identify and spatially localize the defects.

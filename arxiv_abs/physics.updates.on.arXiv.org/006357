Supersonic gas jets produced by converging-diverging (C-D) nozzles are commonly used as targets
for laser-plasma acceleration (LPA) experiments. A major point of interest for these targets is
the gas density at the region of interaction where the laser ionizes the gas plume to create a plasma,
providing the acceleration structure. Tuning the density profiles at this interaction region
is crucial to LPA optimization. A "flat-top" density profile is desired at this line of interaction
to control laser propagation and high energy electron acceleration, while a short high-density
profile is often preferred for acceleration of lower-energy tightly-focused laser-plasma interactions.
A particular design parameter of interest is the curvature of the nozzle's diverging section. We
examine three nozzle designs with different curvatures: the concave "bell", straight conical
and convex "trumpet" nozzles. We demonstrate that, at mm-scale distances from the nozzle exit,
the trumpet and straight nozzles, if optimized, produce "flat-top" density profiles whereas the
bell nozzle creates focused regions of gas with higher densities. An optimization procedure for
the trumpet nozzle is derived and compared to the straight nozzle optimization process. We find
that the trumpet nozzle, by providing an extra parameter of control through its curvature, is more
versatile for creating flat-top profiles and its optimization procedure is more refined compared
to the straight nozzle and the straight nozzle optimization process. We present results for different
nozzle designs from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations performed with the program
ANSYS Fluent and verify them experimentally using neutral density interferometry.

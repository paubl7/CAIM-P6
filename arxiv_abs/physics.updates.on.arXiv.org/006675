Colloidal crystals formed by size-asymmetric binary particles co-assemble into a wide variety
of colloidal compounds with lattices akin to ionic crystals. Recently, a transition from a compound
phase with a sublattice of small particles to a metal-like phase in which the small particles are
delocalized has been predicted computationally and observed experimentally. In this colloidal
metallic phase, the small particles roam the crystal maintaining the integrity of the lattice of
large particles, as electrons do in metals. A similar transition also occurs in superionic crystals,
termed sublattice melting. Here, we use energetic principles and a generalized molecular dynamics
model of a binary system of functionalized nanoparticles to analyze the transition to sublattice
delocalization in different co-assembled crystal phases as a function of T, number of grafted chains
on the small particles, and number ratio between the small and large particles $n_s$:$n_l$. We find
that $n_s$:$n_l$ is the primary determinant of crystal type due to energetic interactions and interstitial
site filling, while the number of grafted chains per small particle determines the stability of
these crystals. We observe first-order sublattice delocalization transitions as T increases,
in which the host lattice transforms from low- to high-symmetry crystal structures, including
A20 to BCT to BCC, Ad to BCT to BCC, and BCC to BCC/FCC to FCC transitions and lattices. Analogous sublattice
transitions driven primarily by lattice vibrations have been seen in some atomic materials exhibiting
an insulator-metal transition also referred to as metallization. We also find minima in the lattice
vibrations and diffusion coefficient of small particles as a function of $n_s$:$n_l$, indicating
enhanced stability of certain crystal structures for $n_s$:$n_l$ values that form compounds.

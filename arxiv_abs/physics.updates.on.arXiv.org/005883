The interaction of localised solitary waves with large-scale, time-varying dispersive mean flows
subject to nonconvex flux is studied in the framework of the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation,
a canonical model for nonlinear internal gravity wave propagation in stratified fluids. The principal
feature of the studied interaction is that both the solitary wave and the large-scale mean flow --
a rarefaction wave or a dispersive shock wave (undular bore) -- are described by the same dispersive
hydrodynamic equation. A recent theoretical and experimental study of this new type of dynamic
soliton-mean flow interaction has revealed two main scenarios when the solitary wave either tunnels
through the varying mean flow that connects two constant asymptotic states, or remains trapped
inside it. While the previous work considered convex systems, in this paper it is demonstrated that
the presence of a nonconvex hydrodynamic flux introduces significant modifications to the scenarios
for transmission and trapping. A reduced set of Whitham modulation equations, termed the solitonic
modulation system, is used to formulate a general, approximate mathematical framework for solitary
wave-mean flow interaction with nonconvex flux. Solitary wave trapping is conveniently stated
in terms of crossing characteristics for the solitonic system. Numerical simulations of the mKdV
equation agree with the predictions of modulation theory. The developed theory draws upon general
properties of dispersive hydrodynamic partial differential equations, not on the complete integrability
of the mKdV equation. As such, the mathematical framework developed here enables application to
other fluid dynamic contexts subject to nonconvex flux.

In the last ten years, full-waveform inversion has emerged as a robust and efficient high-resolution
velocity model-building tool for seismic imaging, with the unique ability to recover complex subsurface
structures. Originally based on a data fitting process using a least-squares cost function, it
suffered from high sensitivity to cycle-skipping and was therefore of poor efficiency in handling
large time shifts between observed and modelled seismic events. To tackle this problem, a common
practice is to start the inversion using the low temporal frequencies of the data and selecting diving
wave events. Complementary to this, the use of other cost functions has been investigated. Among
these, cost functions based on optimal transport appeared appealing to possibly handle large time
shifts between seismic events. Several strategies inspired by optimal transport have been proposed,
taking into account the specificities of seismic data. Among them, the approach based on the Kantorovich-Rubinstein
norm offers the possibility of the direct use of seismic data and an efficient numerical implementation
allowing for a multidimensional (data coordinate space) application. We present here an analysis
of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, discussing its theoretical and practical aspects. A key component
of our analysis is the back-propagated adjoint-source. We highlight its piecewise linearity,
analyze its frequency content and amplitude balancing. We also emphasize the benefit of having
a multidimensional implementation. Furthermore, we give practical rules for setting the tuning
parameters of the numerical implementation. Our set of synthetic and field data examples demonstrate
the improvements brought by the use of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm over least-squares full-waveform
inversion, and highlight the improvements brought by the multidimensional approach over the one-dimensional
one.

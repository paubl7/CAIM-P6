FastCAT, a fast cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) simulator is demonstrated. The fastCAT application
uses pre-calculated Monte Carlo (MC) CBCT scatter and detector response functions to reduce simulation
time for kV and MV CBCT. Pre-calculated x-ray beam energy spectra, detector optical spread functions
and energy deposition, and phantom scatter kernels are combined with beam filtration and GPU raytracing
to produce CBCT volumes. Source spectra are either simulated in EGSnrc using 2.5 and 6 MeV electron
beams incident on a variety of target materials or analytical spectra from a tungsten x-ray tube.
Detectors were modelled in Geant4 extended by Topas including optical transport in the scintillators.
Two MV detectors were modelled, a standard Varian AS1200 GOS detector and a novel CWO high quantum
efficiency detector. Energy dependent scatter kernels were created in Topas for a two 16-cm diameter
water phantoms: a Catphan 515 contrast phantom and a spatial resolution phantom. The Catphan phantom
contained inserts of 1-5 mm in diameter of six different tissue types. These pre-calculated MC datasets
allow the user to create CT volumes with custom phantom inserts, imaging beam, focal spots and detector
combinations. FastCAT simulations retain high fidelity to measurements and MC simulations: MTF
curves were within 1.1% and 4.8% of measured values for the CWO and GOS detectors, respectively.
Contrast in a fastCAT Catphan 515 simulation was seen to be within 1% of an equivalent MC simulation
for all of the tissues. A fastCAT simulation of the Catphan 515 module at a resolution of 1024x1024x10
took 61 seconds on a GPU while the equivalent Topas MC was estimated to take approximately 5.6 CPU
years. We present an open source fast CBCT simulation with high fidelity to MC simulations. The fastCAT

Neural networks are increasingly used in environmental science applications. Furthermore, neural
network models are trained by minimizing a loss function, and it is crucial to choose the loss function
very carefully for environmental science applications, as it determines what exactly is being
optimized. Standard loss functions do not cover all the needs of the environmental sciences, which
makes it important for scientists to be able to develop their own custom loss functions so that they
can implement many of the classic performance measures already developed in environmental science,
including measures developed for spatial model verification. However, there are very few resources
available that cover the basics of custom loss function development comprehensively, and to the
best of our knowledge none that focus on the needs of environmental scientists. This document seeks
to fill this gap by providing a guide on how to write custom loss functions targeted toward environmental
science applications. Topics include the basics of writing custom loss functions, common pitfalls,
functions to use in loss functions, examples such as fractions skill score as loss function, how
to incorporate physical constraints, discrete and soft discretization, and concepts such as focal,
robust, and adaptive loss. While examples are currently provided in this guide for Python with Keras
and the TensorFlow backend, the basic concepts also apply to other environments, such as Python
with PyTorch. Similarly, while the sample loss functions provided here are from meteorology, these
are just examples of how to create custom loss functions. Other fields in the environmental sciences
have very similar needs for custom loss functions, e.g., for evaluating spatial forecasts effectively,
and the concepts discussed here can be applied there as well. All code samples are provided in a GitHub
repository.

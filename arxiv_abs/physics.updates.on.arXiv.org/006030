Power curve is widely used in the wind industry to estimate power output for planning and operational
purposes. Existing methods for power curve estimation have three main limitations: (i) they mostly
rely on wind speed as the sole input, thus ignoring the secondary, yet possibly significant effects
of other environmental factors, (ii) they largely overlook the complex marine environment in which
offshore turbines operate, potentially compromising their value in offshore wind energy applications,
and (ii) they solely focus on the first-order properties of wind power, with little (or null) information
about the variation around the mean behavior, which is important for ensuring reliable grid integration,
asset health monitoring, and energy storage, among others. This study investigates the impact
of several wind- and wave-related factors on offshore wind power variability, with the ultimate
goal of accurately predicting its first two moments. Our approach couples OpenFAST with Gaussian
Process (GP) regression to reveal the underlying relationships governing offshore weather-to-power
conversion. We first find that a multi-input power curve which captures the combined impact of wind
speed, direction, and air density, can provide double-digit improvements relative to univariate
methods which rely on wind speed as the sole explanatory variable (e.g. the standard method of bins).
Wave-related variables are found not important for predicting the average power output, but interestingly,
appear to be extremely relevant in describing the fluctuation of the offshore power around its mean.
Tested on real-world data collected at the New York/New Jersey bight, our proposed multi-input
models demonstrate a high explanatory power in predicting the first two moments of offshore wind
generation, testifying their potential value to the offshore wind industry.

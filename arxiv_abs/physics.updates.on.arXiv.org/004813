We propose an alternative approach to the description and analysis of photoelectron angular distributions
(PADs) resulting from isotropic samples in the case of few-photon absorption via electric fields
of arbitrary polarization. As we demonstrate for the one- and two-photon cases, this approach reveals
the molecular frame information encoded in the $b_{l,m}$ expansion coefficients of the PAD in a
particularly clear way. Our approach does not rely on explicit partial wave expansions of the scattering
wave function and the expressions we obtain are therefore interpreted in terms of the vector field
structure of the photoionization dipole $\vec{D}(\vec{k})$ as a function of the photoelectron
momentum $\vec{k}$. This provides very compact expressions that reveal how molecular rotational
invariants couple to the setup (electric field polarization and detectors) rotational invariants.
We rely heavily on this approach in a companion paper on tensorial chiral setups. Here we apply this
approach to one-photon ionization and find that while $b_{0,0}$ depends only on the magnitude of
$\vec{D}(\vec{k})$, $b_{1,0}$ (non-zero for chiral molecules) is sensitive only to the components
of $\vec{D}(\vec{k})$ perpendicular to $\vec{k}$ encoded in the propensity field $\vec{B}(\vec{k})\equiv
i\vec{D}^{*}(\vec{k})\times\vec{D}(\vec{k})$, and $b_{2,0}$ is sensitive only to the the component
of $\vec{D}(\vec{k})$ along $\vec{k}$. We also analyze the resonantly enhanced two-photon case
where we show that $b_{0,0}$ and $b_{1,0}$ can be written in terms of an effectively stretched $\vec{D}(\vec{k})$,
and that $b_{1,0}$ and $b_{3,0}$ reveal structural information of the field $\vec{B}(\vec{k})$
encoded in three of its vector spherical harmonic expansion coefficients.

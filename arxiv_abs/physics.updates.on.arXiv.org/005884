The dynamics of memristive device in response to neuron-like signals and coupling electronic neurons
via memristive device has been investigated theoretically and experimentally. The simplest experimental
system consists of electronic circuit based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo model and metal-oxide memristive
device. The hardware-software complex based on commercial data acquisition system is implemented
for the imitation of signal from presynaptic neuron`s membrane and synaptic signal transmission
between neurons. The main advantage of our system is that it uses real time dynamics of memristive
device. Electrical response of memristive device shows its behavioral flexibility that allows
presenting a memristive device as an active synapse. This means an internal adjustment of the parameters
of memristive device that leads to modulation of neuron-like signals. Physics-based dynamical
model of memristor is developed in MATLAB for numerical simulation of such a memristive interface
to describe and predict experimentally observed regularities of synchronization of neuron-like
oscillators. FitzHugh-Nagumo circuits time series with a linear or stepwise increase in the signal
amplitude are used to study the memristor response and coupling of neuron-like oscillators taking
into account the stochasticity of memristor model to compare the numerical and experimental data.
The observed forced synchronization modes characterize the dynamic complexity of the memristive
device, which requires further description using high-order dynamical models. The developed
memristive interface will provide high efficiency in the imitation of the synaptic connection
due to its stochastic nature and can be used to increase the flexibility of neuronal connections
for neuroprosthetic challenges.

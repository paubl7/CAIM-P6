This paper predicting Trump victory has been submitted before the election and revised after, allowing
to add a Foreword and Note Added in Revision to discuss in details the causes of the failure of the prediction.
In 2016, Trump was unanimously seen as the loser in the November 8 election. In contrast, using a model
of opinion dynamics I have been developing for a few decades within the framework of sociophysics,
I predicted his victory against all odds. According to the model, the winning paradoxical martingale
of 2016, has been Trump capability to activate frozen prejudices in many voters by provoking their
real indignation. However, four year later, Trump shocking outings do not shock anymore, they became
devitalized, losing their ability to generate major emotional reactions. Does this mean that this
time around he will lose the 2020 election against Biden, as nearly all analysts, pundits and commentators
still predict? No, because with frozen prejudices remaining frozen, the spontaneous prejudices
will be activated but this time they will benefit to both Biden and Trump. The main ones are the fear
of the other candidate policy and the personal stand facing a danger. In addition, Trump presidency
having polarized a large part of American voters into narrow-minded anti-Trump and narrow-minded
pro-Trump, those I denote in my model as inflexibles, will be driving the dynamics of choices. Both
effects, prejudices and inflexibles can either compete or cooperate making their local combination
within each state, decisive to determine the faith of the state election. As a result, tiny differences
can make the outcome. Based on my rough estimates of associated proportions of inflexibles and prejudices,
the model predicts Trump victory in the 2020 November election.

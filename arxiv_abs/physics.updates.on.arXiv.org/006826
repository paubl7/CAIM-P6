In recent decades novel solid substrates have been designed which change their wettability in response
to light or an electrostatic field. Here, we investigate a droplet on substrates with oscillating
uniform wettability by varying minimium and maximum contact angles and frequency. To simulate
this situation, we use our previous work [Grawitter and Stark, Soft Matter 17, 2454 (2021)], where
we implemented the boundary element method in combination with the Cox-Voinov law for the contact-line
velocity, to determine the fluid flow inside a droplet. After a transient regime the droplet performs
steady oscillations, the amplitude of which decreases with increasing frequency. For slow oscillations
our numerical results agree well with the linearized spherical-cap model. They collapse on a master
curve when we rescale frequency by a characteristic relaxation time. In contrast, for fast oscillations
we observe significant deviations from the master curve. The decay of the susceptibility is weaker
and the phase shift between oscillations in wettability and contact angle stays below the predicted
$\pi/2$. The reason becomes obvious when studying the combined dynamics of droplet height and contact
angle. It reveals non-reciprocal shape changes during one oscillation period even at low frequencies
due to the induced fluid flow inside the droplet, which are not captured by the spherical-cap model.
Similar periodic non-reciprocal shape changes occur at low frequencies when the droplet is placed
on an oscillating nonuniform wettability profile with six-fold symmetry. Such profiles are inspired
by the light intensity pattern of Laguerre-Gauss laser modes. Since the non-reciprocal shape changes
induce fluid circulation, which is controllable from the outside, our findings envisage to design
targeted microfluidic transport of solutes inside the droplet.

For safety purposes, reliable reignition of aircraft engines in the event of flame blow-out is a
critical requirement. Typically, an external ignition source in the form of a spark is used to achieve
a stable flame in the combustor. However, such forced turbulent ignition may not always successfully
relight the combustor, mainly because the state of the combustor cannot be precisely determined.
Uncertainty in the turbulent flow inside the combustor, inflow conditions, and spark discharge
characteristics can lead to variability in sparking outcomes even for nominally identical operating
conditions. Prior studies have shown that of all the uncertain parameters, turbulence is often
dominant and can drastically alter ignition behavior. For instance, even when different fuels
have similar ignition delay times, their ignition behavior in practical systems can be completely
different. In practical operating conditions, it is challenging to understand why ignition fails
and how much variation in outcomes can be expected. The focus of this work is to understand relight
variability induced by turbulence for two different aircraft fuels, namely Jet-A and a variant
named C1. A detailed, previously developed simulation approach is used to generate a large number
of successful and failed ignition events. Using this data, the cause of misfire is evaluated based
on a discriminant analysis that delineates the difference between turbulent initial conditions
that lead to ignition or failure. It was determined that the cause of ignition failure is different
for the two fuels. While it was found that Jet-A is influenced by fuel entrainment, C1 was found to
be more sensitive to small scale turbulence features. A larger variability is found in the ignition
modes of C1, which can be subject to extreme events induced by kernel breakdown.

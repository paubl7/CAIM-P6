We examine the translation of a sphere in a stably stratified ambient in the limit of small Reynolds
($Re \ll 1$) and viscous Richardson numbers ($Ri_v \ll 1$); here, $Re = \frac{\rho Ua}{\mu}$ and
$Ri_v = \frac{\gamma a^3 g}{\mu U}$ with $a$ being the sphere radius, $U$ the translation speed,
$\rho$ and $\mu$ the density and viscosity of the stratified ambient, $g$ the acceleration due to
gravity, and $\gamma$ the density gradient (assumed constant) characterizing the ambient stratification.
In contrast to most earlier efforts, our study considers the convection dominant limit corresponding
to $Pe = \frac{Ua}{D} \gg 1$, $D$ being the diffusivity of the stratifying agent. We characterize
in detail the velocity and density fields around the particle in what we term the Stokes stratification
regime, defined by $Re \ll Ri_v^{\frac{1}{3}} \ll 1$, and corresponding to the dominance of buoyancy
over inertial forces. Buoyancy forces associated with the perturbed stratification fundamentally
alter the viscously dominated fluid motion at large distances. At distances of order the stratification
screening length, that scales as $aRi_v^{-\frac{1}{3}}$, the motion transforms from the familiar
fore-aft symmetric Stokesian form to a fore-aft asymmetric pattern of recirculating cells with
primarily horizontal motion within; except in the vicinity of the rear stagnation streamline.
At larger distances, the motion is vanishingly small except within (a) an axisymmetric horizontal
wake whose vertical extent grows as $O(r_t^{\frac{2}{5}})$, $r_t$ being the distance in the plane
perpendicular to translation and (b) a buoyant reverse jet behind the particle that narrows as the
inverse square root of distance downstream.

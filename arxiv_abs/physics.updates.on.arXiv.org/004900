Assuming that partisan fairness and responsiveness are important aspects of redistricting, it
is important to measure them. Many measures of partisan bias are satisfactory for states that are
balanced with roughly equal proportions of voters for the two major parties. It has been less clear
which metrics measure fairness robustly when the proportion of the vote is unbalanced by as little
as 60% to 40%. We have addressed this by analyzing past election results for four states with Democratic
preferences (CA, IL, MA, and MD), three states with Republican preferences (SC, TN, and TX) and comparing
those to results for four nearly balanced states (CO, NC, OH, and PA). We used many past statewide
elections in each state to build statistically precise seats for votes and rank for votes graphs
to which many measures of partisan bias were applied. In addition to providing values of responsiveness,
we find that five of the measures of bias provide mutually consistent values in all states, thereby
providing a core of usable measures for unbalanced states. Although all five measures focus on different
aspects of partisan bias, normalization of the values across the eleven states provides a suitable
way to compare them, and we propose that their average provides a superior measure which we call composite
bias. Regarding other measures, we find that the most seemingly plausible symmetry measure fails
for unbalanced states. We also consider deviations from the proportionality ideal, but using it
is difficult because the political geography of a state can entangle responsiveness with total
partisan bias. We do not attempt to separate intentional partisan bias from the implicit bias that
results from the interaction of the map drawing rules of a state and its political geography, on the
grounds that redistricting should attempt to minimize total partisan bias whatever its provenance.

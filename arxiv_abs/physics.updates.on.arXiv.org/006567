Obtaining a precise theoretical description of the spectral properties of liquid water poses challenges
for both molecular dynamics (MD) and electronic structure methods. The lower computational cost
of the Koopmans-compliant functionals with respect to Green's function methods allows the simulations
of many MD trajectories, with a description close to the state-of-art quasi-particle self-consistent
GW plus vertex corrections method (QSGW+f$_{xc}$). Thus, we explore water spectral properties
when different MD approaches are used, ranging from classical MD to first-principles MD, and including
nuclear quantum effects. We have observed that the different MD approaches lead to up to 1 eV change
in the average band gap, thus, we focused on the band gap dependence with the geometrical properties
of the system to explain such spread. We have evaluated the changes in the band gap due to variations
in the intramolecular O-H bond distance, and HOH angle, as well as the intermolecular hydrogen bond
O$\cdot\cdot\cdot$O distance, and the OHO angles. We have observed that the dominant contribution
comes from the O-H bond length; the O$\cdot\cdot\cdot$O distance plays a secondary role, and the
other geometrical properties do not significantly influence the gap. Furthermore, we analyze
the electronic density of states (DOS), where the KIPZ functional shows a good agreement with the
DOS obtained with state-of-art approaches employing quasi-particle self-consistent GW plus
vertex corrections. The O-H bond length also significantly influences the DOS. When nuclear quantum
effects are considered, a broadening of the peaks driven by the broader distribution of the O-H bond
lengths is observed, leading to a closer agreement with the experimental photoemission spectra.

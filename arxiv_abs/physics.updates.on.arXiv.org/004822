A variety of activities are commonly used in college physics courses including lab, tutorials,
and studio curricula. Instructors must choose among using research-based activities, designing
their own activities or modifying existing activities. Instructors' choices depend on their own
goals and the goals of activities from which they are choosing. To assist them in developing or modifying
activities for their situation, we examine research-based activities to determine their goals
and the features of the activities associated with these goals. Since most activities ask students
to perform tasks to assist them in learning, sixty-six activities from eleven different research-based
curricula were coded for student actions. The coding scheme containing forty-nine codes in ten
categories was developed from a subset of activities, interviews with some of the activity designers,
and recommendations from the American Association of Physics Teachers 2014 lab report. The results
were examined using k-means cluster analysis revealing three design clusters. We label these clusters
Thinking like a Scientists, Learning Concepts, Building Models. These three clusters reflect
diverse design goals. In the Thinking like a Scientist cluster, activities emphasize design of
experiments by students, discussion, error analysis, reasonableness checking, supporting claims,
and making assumptions or simplifications. The Learning Concepts cluster focuses on prediction
of results and experimental observations. The Building Models cluster emphasizes discussion
and answering physics or math questions that do not use collected data. This work connects common
features appearing in physics activities with the goals and strategies of the designers. In this
way it may provide instructors with a more straightforward way to creat activities which achieve
their desired outcomes.

The operation of satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO) has been linked to a variety of benefits
to both the spacecraft platform and mission design. Critically, for Earth observation (EO) missions
a reduction in altitude can enable smaller and less powerful payloads to achieve the same performance
as larger instruments or sensors at higher altitude, with significant benefits to the spacecraft
design. As a result, renewed interest in the exploitation of these orbits has spurred the development
of new technologies that have the potential to enable sustainable operations in this lower altitude
range. In this paper, system models are developed for (i) novel materials that improve aerodynamic
performance enabling reduced drag or increased lift production and resistance to atomic oxygen
erosion and (ii) atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion (ABEP) for sustained drag compensation
or mitigation in VLEO. Attitude and orbit control methods that can take advantage of the aerodynamic
forces and torques in VLEO are also discussed. These system models are integrated into a framework
for concept-level satellite design and this approach is used to explore the system-level trade-offs
for future EO spacecraft enabled by these new technologies. A case-study presented for an optical
very-high resolution spacecraft demonstrates the significant potential of reducing orbital
altitude using these technologies and indicates possible savings of up to 75% in system mass and
over 50% in development and manufacturing costs in comparison to current state-of-the-art missions.
For a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, the reduction in mass and cost with altitude were
shown to be smaller, though it was noted that currently available cost models do not capture recent
commercial advancements in this segment...

This paper studies numerically how the signal detector arrangement influences the performance
of reservoir computing using spin waves excited in a ferrimagnetic garnet film. This investigation
is essentially important since the input information is not only conveyed but also transformed
by the spin waves into high-dimensional information space when the waves propagate in the film in
a spatially distributed manner. This spatiotemporal dynamics realizes a rich reservoir-computational
functionality. First, we simulate spin waves in a rectangular garnet film with two input electrodes
to obtain spatial distributions of the reservoir states in response to input signals, which are
represented as spin vectors and used for a machine-learning waveform classification task. The
detected reservoir states are combined through readout connection weights to generate a final
output. We visualize the spatial distribution of the weights after training to discuss the number
and positions of the output electrodes by arranging them at grid points, equiangularly circular
points or at random. We evaluate the classification accuracy by changing the number of the output
electrodes, and find that a high accuracy ($>$ 90\%) is achieved with only several tens of output
electrodes regardless of grid, circular or random arrangement. These results suggest that the
spin waves possess sufficiently complex and rich dynamics for this type of tasks. Then we investigate
in which area useful information is distributed more by arranging the electrodes locally on the
chip. Finally, we show that this device has generalization ability for input wave-signal frequency
in a certain frequency range. These results will lead to practical design of spin-wave reservoir
devices for low-power intelligent computing in the near future.

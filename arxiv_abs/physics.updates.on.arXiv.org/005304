The spontaneous formation of micelles in aqueous solutions is governed by the amphipathic nature
of surfactants and is practically interesting due to the regular use of micelles as membrane mimics,
for the characterization of protein structure, and for drug design and delivery. We performed a
systematic characterization of the finite-size effect observed in single-component dodecylphosphocholine
(DPC) micelles with the coarse-grained MARTINI model. Of multiple coarse-grained solvent models
investigated using large system sizes, the non-polarizable solvent model was found to most-accurately
reproduce SANS spectra of 100 mM DPC in aqueous solution. We systematically investigated the finite-size
effect at constant 100 mM concentration in 23 systems of sizes 40 to 150 DPC, confirming the finite-size
effect to manifest as an oscillation in the mean micelle aggregation number about the thermodynamic
aggregation number as the system size increases, mostly diminishing once the system supports formation
of three micelles. The accuracy of employing a multiscale simulation approach to avoid finite-size
effects in the micelle size distribution and SANS spectra using MARTINI and CHARMM36 was explored
using multiple long timescale 500-DPC coarse-grained simulations which were back-mapped to CHARMM36
all-atom systems. It was found that the MARTINI model generally occupies more volume than the all-atom
model, leading to the formation of micelles that are of a reasonable radius of gyration, but are smaller
in aggregation number. The systematic characterization of the finite-size effect and exploration
of multiscale modeling presented in this work provides guidance for the accurate modeling of micelles
in simulations.

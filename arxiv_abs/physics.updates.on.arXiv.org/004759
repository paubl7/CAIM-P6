Purpose: We have been investigating 2D antiscatter grids (2D ASG) to reduce scatter fluence and
improve image quality in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). In this work, two different aspects
of 2D ASGs, their scatter rejection and correction capability, were investigated in CBCT experiments.
To correct residual scatter transmitted through the 2D ASG, it was used as a scatter measurement
device with a novel method: grid-based scatter sampling. Methods: Three focused 2D ASG prototypes
with grid ratios of 8, 12, and 16 were developed for linac-mounted CBCT geometry. In the first phase,
2D ASGs were used as a scatter rejection device, and the effect of grid ratio on CT number accuracy
and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) evaluated in CBCT images. In the second phase, the grid-based
scatter sampling method was implemented. The percent change in CT numbers was measured by changing
the phantom size from head to pelvis configuration.Results: When 2D ASG was used as a scatter rejection
device, CT number variation due to change in phantom dimensions was reduced from 23% to 2 - 6%. A grid
ratio of 16 yielded the lowest CT number variation. All three 2D ASGs yielded improvement in CNR,
up to a factor of two in pelvis-sized phantoms. When 2D ASG prototypes were used for both scatter rejection
and correction, CT number variations were reduced further, to 1.3 - 2.6%. Conclusions: When 2D ASG
was used solely as a scatter rejection device, substantial improvement in CT number accuracy could
be achieved by increasing the grid ratio. 2D ASGs could also provide significant CNR improvement
even at lower grid ratios. When 2D ASG was used in conjunction with the grid-based scatter sampling
method, it provided further improvement in CT number accuracy, irrespective of the grid ratio,
while preserving 2D ASG's capacity to improve CNR.

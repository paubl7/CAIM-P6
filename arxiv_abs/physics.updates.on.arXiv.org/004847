Atomic Force Microscopy with SideWall (AFM SW) is widely used for nano-scale surface measurements
at side surfaces. In the current study, by taking into consideration the effects of sidewall beam
and its probe, an analytical method is developed to explore the dynamics of AFM-SW. The effect of
probe mass, sidewall extension length, and tip sample interactions on the resonance frequencies
and amplitude of Micro-Cantilever is widely investigated. The obtained results of the analytical
model demonstrate the significant effect of these parameters on the dynamics of AFM-SW. To verify
the accuracy of the analytical model, the obtained results are compared against the simulation
data of previously published works and a good agreement is observed. Resonance Frequency (RF) of
cantilever clearly declines when the mass of probe is taken to account, especially in higher RFs.
Besides, probe effect on RF is higher when sidewall beam is longer. Resonance frequency decreases
when tip-sample interaction or probe mass is high, yet the amount of reduction is intensified when
probe mass and interaction together are at higher point. An analytical method is developed to explore

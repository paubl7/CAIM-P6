Optimal control of turbulent mixed-convection flows has attracted considerable attention from
researchers. Numerical algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are powerful tools that allow
to perform global optimization. These algorithms are particularly of great interest in complex
optimization problems where cost functionals may lack smoothness and regularity. In turbulent
flow optimization, the hybridization of GA with high fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
is extremely demanding in terms of computational time and memory storage. Thus, alternative approaches
aiming to alleviate these requirements are of great interest. Nowadays, data driven approaches
gained attention due to their potential in predicting flow solutions based only on preexisting
data. In the present paper, we propose a near-real time data-driven genetic algorithm (DDGA) for
inverse parameter identification problems involving turbulent flows. In this optimization framework,
the parametrized flow data are used in their reduced form obtained by the POD (Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition) and solutions prediction is made by interpolating the temporal and the spatial
POD subspaces through a recently developed Riemannian barycentric interpolation. The validation
of the proposed optimization approach is carried out in the parameter identification problem of
the turbulent mixed-convection flow in a cavity. The objective is to determine the inflow temperature
and inflow velocity corresponding to a given temperature distribution in a restricted area of the
spatial domain. The results show that the proposed genetic programming optimization framework
is able to deliver good approximations of the optimal solutions within less than two minutes.

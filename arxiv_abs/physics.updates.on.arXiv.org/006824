Purpose: To develop a model to generate volumetric dose distribution from two isodose surfaces
(iso-surfaces), and to interactively tune dose distribution by iso-surface dragging. Methods:
We model volumetric dose distribution as analytical extension of two iso-surfaces with the extension
variables as distances to iso-surfaces. We built a 3D lookup table (LUT) which are generated based
on clinical dose distributions. Two LUT tables store the mean and standard deviation of voxel dose
values of clinical doses and binned as distance to 100% iso-surface, reference iso-surface and
reference dose level. The process of interactive tuning starts from a given base plan. A user drags
iso-surface for a desired carving. Our method responds with tuned dose. The derivation of tuned
dose follows two steps. Dose is extended from the two user-desired iso-surfaces (eg.100% and 50%)
to the whole patient volume by table lookup, using distances to two iso-surfaces and reference dose
level as keys. Then we fine tune the extended dose by a correction strategy utilizing the information
of base plan. Results: We validated this method on coplanar VMAT doses of post-operative prostate
plans. The LUT was populated by dose distributions of 27 clinical plans. We optimized two plans with
different rectum sparing for an independent case to mimic the process of dose tuning. The plan with
less rectum sparing is set as base plan. The 50% iso-surface of the more-sparing plan is defined as
the desired iso-surface input. The dose output by our method (expansion and correction) agrees
with the more-sparing plan obtained by optimization, in terms of gamma (97.2%), DVH and profiles.
The overall dose reconstruction time is within two seconds. Conclusion: We developed a distance-to-isosurface
based volumetric dose reconstruction method, and applied it to interactive tuning with iso-surface
dragging.

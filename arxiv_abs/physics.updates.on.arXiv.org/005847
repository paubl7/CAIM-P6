Tidally locked exoplanets likely host global atmospheric circulations with a superrotating equatorial
jet, planetary-scale stationary waves and thermally-driven overturning circulation. In this
work, we show that each of these features can be separated from the total circulation by using a Helmholtz
decomposition, which splits the circulation into rotational (divergence free) and divergent
(vorticity free) components. This technique is applied to the simulated circulation of a terrestrial
planet and a gaseous hot Jupiter. For both planets, the rotational component comprises the equatorial
jet and stationary waves, and the divergent component contains the overturning circulation. Separating
out each component allows us to evaluate their spatial structure and relative contribution to the
total flow. In contrast with previous work, we show that divergent velocities are not negligible
when compared with rotational velocities, and that divergent, overturning circulation takes
the form of a single, roughly isotropic cell that ascends on the day-side and descends on the night-side.
These conclusions are drawn for both the terrestrial case and the hot Jupiter. To illustrate the
utility of the Helmholtz decomposition for studying atmospheric processes, we compute the contribution
of each of the circulation components to heat transport from day- to night-side. Surprisingly,
we find that the divergent circulation dominates day-night heat transport in the terrestrial case
and accounts for around half of the heat transport for the hot Jupiter. The relative contributions
of the rotational and divergent components to day-night heat transport are likely sensitive to
multiple planetary parameters and atmospheric processes, and merit further study.

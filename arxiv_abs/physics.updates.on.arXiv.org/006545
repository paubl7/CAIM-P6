Resistive-switching -- the current-/voltage-induced electrical resistance change -- is at the
core of memristive devices, which play an essential role in the emerging field of neuromorphic computing.
This study is about resistive switching in a Mott-insulator, which undergoes a thermally driven
metal-to-insulator transition. Two distinct switching mechanisms were reported for such a system:
electric-field-driven resistive switching and electrothermal resistive switching. The latter
results from an instability caused by Joule heating. Here, we present the visualization of the reversible
resistive switching in a planar V$_2$O$_3$ thin-film device using high-resolution wide-field
microscopy in combination with electric transport measurements. We investigate the interaction
of the electrothermal instability with the strain-induced spontaneous phase-separation in the
V$_2$O$_3$ thin film at the Mott-transition. The photomicrographs show the formation of a narrow
metallic filament with a minimum width $\lesssim$ 500\,nm. Although the filament formation and
the overall shape of the current-voltage characteristics (IVCs) are typical of an electrothermal
breakdown, we also observe atypical effects like oblique filaments, filament splitting, and hysteretic
IVCs with sawtooth-like jumps at high currents in the low-resistance regime. We were able to reproduce
the experimental results in a numerical model based on a two-dimensional resistor network. This
model demonstrates that resistive switching, in this case, is indeed electrothermal and that the
intrinsic heterogeneity is responsible for the atypical effects. This heterogeneity is strongly
influenced by strain, thereby establishing a link between switching dynamics and structural properties.

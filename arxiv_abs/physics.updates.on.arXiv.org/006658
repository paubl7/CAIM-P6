The physics of behavior seeks simple descriptions of animal behavior. The field has advanced rapidly
by using techniques in low dimensional dynamics distilled from computer vision. Yet, we still do
not generally understand the rules which shape these emergent behavioral manifolds in the face
of complicated neuro-construction -- even in the simplest of animals. In this work, we introduce
a non-neuromuscular model system which is complex enough to teach us something new but also simple
enough for us to understand. In this simple animal, the manifolds underlying the governing dynamics
are shaped and stabilized by a physical mechanism: an active-elastic, inverse-energy cascade.
Building upon pioneering work in the field, we explore the formulation of the governing dynamics
of a polarized active elastic sheet in terms of the normal modes of an elastic structure decorated
by a polarized activity at every node. By incorporating a torque mediated coupling physics, we show
that power is pumped from the shortest length scale up to longer length scale modes via a combination
of direct mode coupling and preferential dissipation. We use this result to motivate the study of
organismal locomotion as an emergent simplicity governing organism-scale behavior. To master
the low dimensional dynamics on this manifold, we present a zero-transients limit study of the dynamics
of +1 or vortex-like defects in the ciliary field. We show, experimentally, numerically and analytically
that these defects arise from this energy cascade to generate long-lived, stable modes of locomotive
behavior. Using a geometric model, we can link defects to organism locomotion. We extend this framework
to study larger organisms with non-circular shape and introduce local activity modulation for
defect steering. We expect this work to inform the foundations of organismal control of distributed
actuation without muscles or neurons.

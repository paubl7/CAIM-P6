Aiming to measure the difference in arrival times of two coincident gamma-photons with an accuracy
in the order of 200 ps, time-of-flight positron emission tomography systems commonly employ silicon
photomultipliers (SiPMs) and high-resolution digitization electronics, application specific
integrated circuits (ASICs). This work evaluates the performance of the TOFPET2 ASIC, released
by PETsys Electronics S.A. in 2017, dependent on its configuration parameters in multi-channel
coincidence measurements. SiPM arrays fabricated by different vendors (KETEK, SensL, Hamamatsu,
Broadcom) were tested in combination with the ASIC. Scintillator arrays featuring different reflector
designs and different configurations of the TOFPET2 ASIC software parameters were evaluated.
The benchtop setup used is provided with the TOFPET2 ASIC evaluation kit by PETsys Electronics S.A..
Compared to existing studies featuring the TOFPET2 ASIC, multi-channel performance results dependent
on a larger set of ASIC configuration parameters were obtained that have not been reported to this
extend so far. The ASIC shows promising CRTs down to 219.9 ps in combination with two Hamamatsu S14161-3050-HS-08
SiPM arrays (128 channels read out, energy resolution 13.08 %) and 216.1 ps in combination with two
Broadcom AFBR-S4N44P643S SiPM arrays (32 channels read out, energy resolution 9.46 %). The length
of the trigger delay of the dark count suppression scheme has an impact on the ASIC performance. The
integrator gain configuration has been investigated and allows an improvement of the energy resolution.
Measuring up to the time-of-flight performance of state-of-the-art positron emission tomography
(ToF-PET) systems while providing a uniform and stable readout for multiple channels at the same
time, the TOFPET2 ASIC is treated as promising candidate for the integration in future ToF-PET systems.

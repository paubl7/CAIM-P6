In the past few decades, great efforts are devoted to studying heat transfer in nanoscale due to its
importance in multiple technologies such as thermal control and sensing applications. Heat conduction
through the nanoconfined gas medium differs from macroscopic predictions due to several reasons.
The continuum assumption is broken down; the surface forces become prominent due to the large surface-to-volume
ratio, the wall force field is more extended through the gas medium, and, finally, the gas molecules
are accumulated nonuniformly on the solid surfaces. In this work, to better understand the combination
of these phenomena on the heat conduction through the nanoconfined gas medium, we present a series
of molecular dynamics simulations of argon gas confined between metals and silicon walls. The gas
density is set so that gas experiences a wide range of Knudsen numbers from continuum to the free molecular
regime. It is observed that the temperature distribution through the gas medium for all metallic
walls can be represented by a unique profile for the same gas density in the middle of the channel.
It is also shown that the intrinsic characteristics of the solid determine the gas density distribution
near the walls and consequently in the bulk region, and gas atoms distribution controls the heat
conduction through the gas medium. While the nanochannel walls have their most significant impact
on the rarefied gas's density, temperature, pressure, and heat flux, the pressure and heat flux
are converged toward a plateau as the gas becomes denser. Finally, we propose a new analytical formula
for calculating the heat flux through the argon gas, which incorporates the wall effects on gas transport
characteristics for the Knudsen number in the range of 0.05 to 20.

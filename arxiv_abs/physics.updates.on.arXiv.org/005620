In solar energetic particle (SEP) events, the physical processes of both shock acceleration and
scattering during transport can cause energy-spectral indices to be correlated with enhancement
or suppression of element abundances versus mass-to-charge ratios A/Q. We observe correlations
for those "gradual" SEP events where shock waves accelerate ions from the ambient coronal plasma,
but there are no such correlations for "impulsive" SEP events produced by magnetic reconnection
in solar jets, where abundance enhancement in different events vary from (A/Q)^+2 to (A/Q)^+8,
nor are there correlations when shock waves reaccelerate these residual impulsive ions. In these
latter events the abundances are determined separately, prior to the accelerated spectra. Events
with correlated spectra and abundances show a wide variety of interesting behavior that has not
been described previously. Small and moderate gradual SEP events, with relative abundances typically
depending approximately upon (A/Q)^-1 and the spectra upon energy E^-2.5, vary little with time.
Large SEP events show huge temporal variations skirting the correlation line; in one case O spectra
vary with time from E^-1 to E^-5 while abundances vary from (A/Q)^+1 to (A/Q)^-2 during the event.
In very large events, streaming-limited transport through proton-generated resonant Alfve'n
waves flattens the spectra and enhances heavy ion abundances prior to local shock passage, then
steepens the spectra and reduces enhancements afterward, recapturing the typical correlation.
Systematic correlation of spectra and element abundances provide a new perspective on the "injection
problem" of ion selection by shocks and on the physics of SEP acceleration and transport.

The aimless meandering of tiny particles in mid-air is a phenomenon we encounter daily but rarely
pay attention to; unless perhaps when it is a key mechanism that spreads a deadly disease. But for
a band of atmospheric-scientists and astrophysicists, the motion of particles in turbulence is
never a trivial matter, since it is behind the mechanism for growth of cloud-droplets (planetesimal)
into rain (protoplanets) via turbulent induced collision-coagulation of particles. For engineers
pondering the design of future, greener, combustion engines, this is a scenario they wish to understand
and control. Simple causality prompted most works in the past decades to investigate how turbulent-enhanced
particle density and/or relative velocity could augment collision-coagulation rate.However,
our work has two major results: 1) The surprising fact that collision-coagulation dramatically
suppresses the radial-distribution-function (RDF) which quantifies the enhancement of local
particle-density and also strongly affect their relative velocities, thus challenging the simple
causality; 2) A complete stochastic theory that link particle collision rate to relative velocity
and RDF is presented and shown to be accurate and explain the preceding result. The theory also accounts
for the role of turbulent-fluctuation missing in earlier mean-field theories and predicts a strong
coupling between particle clustering and mean inter-particle radial-velocity (MRV). We also
present a phenomenological model for MRV which is accurate when suitably calibrated. %using the
4th moment of the fluid velocities. We uncover a paradox: the unjustified accuracy of the differential
form of the theory. Our results call for a paradigm-shift in how we understand this subject.

The world is composed by events. We can sense the changes of events directly by our five senses or indirectly
by using the measurement equipment and tools. If in a closed system including the observer no changes
are sensed, no time passes and if even a very small change is sensed, time passes. It means that the
time is not a real degree of freedom and can be only understood through the concept of changes in events.
The events can be considered as relata and their mutual or multiple interactions can be considered
as relation. Causality can be sensed if one relata creates a change in the other relata and in consequence
the passage of time can be sensed. These two relates are connected to each other by a causal world line.
If two relates are connected by a timelike curve theoretically, but they cannot make change in each
other, one relata has only a priority in occurrence respect to other (time precedence), and in consequence,
one can omit the past non-casual events from the casual world line. In addition, in causality relation,
we should consider more than one causal world line due to the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics
and its probabilistic nature (superposition principle). Therefore, at Planck scale, more than
one casual world line should be assigned to the relation between two casual events when we want to
study the dynamic of spacetime. It means that no kinematic state can be considered at Planck scale
and a quantum spacetime manifold (QSTM) should be only assigned to the casual world line, from beginning.
The quantum field operators and the particles are assigned to the point of the QSTM in Planck scale
and in consequence, the physical theories are background dependent at the scale.

Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) are gas avalanche devices that have been enabled by modern photo-lithography.
Compared to traditional multi wire proportional chambers, GEMs offer smaller feature size and
higher rate capabilities. When designing GEM-based detectors, often a large parameter space of
gas mixtures, GEM specifications, and operational parameters needs to be considered. In this context,
a description which parameterizes the gain and the energy resolution to include these quantities
is valuable for efficient detector design optimization and interpretation of results. We present
avalanche gain and associated pulse-height resolution measurements recorded with a $^4$He:CO$_2$
(70:30) gas mixture and pure SF$_6$, a Negative Ion (NI) gas. SF$_6$ is of particular interest to
the directional dark matter community, as its low thermal diffusion helps to retain recoil ionization
track information over large drift lengths. With some review, and the aid of a general form of the
first Townsend coefficient, multiple GEM-based detector data sets are used to study gas gain across
a large reduced field, $E/p$, range. The high-gain behavior, where detector or readout electronics
noise becomes negligible, of the electron drift gas is well described purely in terms of experimental
parameters relevant for GEM-based detectors. Operation at high gain is an important consideration
for experiments involved in low-energy, rare-event searches. The pulse-height resolution measurements
are also used to discuss the variance of the avalanche distribution and to describe the lower limits
of energy resolution one should expect to measure. In the end, a more comprehensive understanding
of avalanche gain, its effect on energy resolution, and the contributing experimental parameters
in GEM-based detectors is developed for further use.

The simultaneous detection of organic molecules of the form C$_2$H$_{\text{n}}$O, such as ketene
(CH$_2$CO), acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), and ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH), toward early star-forming
regions offers hints of shared chemical history. Several reaction routes have been proposed and
experimentally verified under various interstellar conditions to explain the formation pathways
involved. Most noticeably, the non-energetic processing of C$_2$H$_2$ ice with OH-radicals and
H-atoms was shown to provide formation routes to ketene, acetaldehyde, ethanol, and vinyl alcohol
(CH$_2$CHOH) along the H$_2$O formation sequence on grain surfaces. In this work, the non-energetic
formation scheme is extended with laboratory measurements focusing on the energetic counterpart,
induced by cosmic rays penetrating the H$_2$O-rich ice mantle. The focus here is on the H$^+$ radiolysis
of interstellar C$_2$H$_2$:H$_2$O ice analogs at 17 K. Ultra-high vacuum experiments were performed
to investigate the 200 keV H$^+$ radiolysis chemistry of predeposited C$_2$H$_2$:H$_2$O ices,
both as mixed and layered geometries. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor
in situ newly formed species as a function of the accumulated energy dose (or H$^+$ fluence). The
infrared (IR) spectral assignments are further confirmed in isotope labeling experiments using
H$_2$$^{18}$O. The energetic processing of C$_2$H$_2$:H$_2$O ice not only results in the formation
of (semi-) saturated hydrocarbons (C$_2$H$_4$ and C$_2$H$_6$) and polyynes as well as cumulenes
(C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_4$H$_4$), but it also efficiently forms O-bearing COMs, including vinyl alcohol,
ketene, acetaldehyde, and ethanol, for which the reaction cross-section and product composition
are derived. A clear composition transition of the product, from H-poor to H-rich species, is observed
as a function of the accumulated energy dose.

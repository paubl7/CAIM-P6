Fractal dimension curves of urban growth can be modeled with sigmoid functions, including logistic
function and quadratic logistic function. Different types of logistic functions indicate different
spatial dynamics. The fractal dimension curves of urban growth in western countries follows the
common logistic function, while these curves of cities in northern China follows quadratic logistic
function. Now we want to know whether all Chinese cities follow the same rules of urban evolution.
This paper is devoted to exploring the fractals and fractal dimension properties of the city of Shenzhen
in southern China. The urban region is divided into four subareas, ArcGIS technology, box-counting
method is adopted to extract spatial datasets, and the least squares regression is employed to estimate
fractal parameters. The results show that: (1) The urban form of Shenzhen city has clear fractal
structure, but fractal dimension values of different subareas are different; (2) The fractal dimension
growth curves of all the four study areas can only be modeled by the common logistic function, and
the goodness of fit increases over time; (3) The peak of urban growth in Shenzhen had passed before
1986, the fractal dimension growth is approaching its maximum capacity. Conclusions can be reached
that the urban form of Shenzhen bears characteristics of multifractals, the fractal structure
has been becoming better gradually through self-organization, but its land resources are reaching
the limits of growth. The fractal dimension curves of Shenzhen's urban growth are similar to those
of European and American cities, but differ from those of the cities in northern China. This suggests
that there is subtle different dynamic mechanisms of city development between northern and southern
China.

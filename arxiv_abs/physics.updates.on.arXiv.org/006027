The influence of high-enthalpy effects on hypersonic turbulent boundary layers is investigated
by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS). A quasi-adiabatic flat-plate air flow at free-stream
Mach number equal to 10 is simulated up to fully-developed turbulent conditions using a five-species,
chemically-reacting model. A companion DNS based on a frozen-chemistry assumption is also carried
out, in order to isolate the effect of finite-rate chemical reactions and assess their influence
on turbulent quantities. In order to reduce uncertainties associated with turbulence generation
at the inlet of the computational domain, both simulations are initiated in the laminar flow region
and the flow is let to evolve up to the fully turbulent regime. Modal forcing by means of localized
suction and blowing is used to trigger laminar-to-turbulent transition. The high temperatures
reached in the near wall region including the viscous and buffer sublayers activate significant
dissociation of both oxygen and nitrogen. This modifies in turn the thermodynamic and transport
properties of the reacting mixture, affecting the first-order statistics of thermodynamic quantities.
Due to the endothermic nature of the chemical reactions in the forward direction, temperature and
density fluctuations in the reacting layer are smaller than in the frozen-chemistry flow. However,
the first- and second-order statistics of the velocity field are found to be little affected by the
chemical reactions under a scaling that accounts for the modified fluid properties. We also observed
that the Strong Reynolds Analogy (SRA) remains well respected despite the severe hypersonic conditions
and that the computed skin friction coefficient distributions match well the results of the Renard-Deck
decomposition extended to compressible flows.

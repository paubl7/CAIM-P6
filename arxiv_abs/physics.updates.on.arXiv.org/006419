UnDiFi-2D, an open source (free software) Unstructured-grid, Discontinuity Fitting code, is
presented. The aim of UnDiFi-2D is to model gas-dynamic discontinuities in two-dimensional (2D)
flows as if they were true discontinuities of null thickness that bound regions of the flow-field
where a smooth solution to the governing PDEs exists. UnDiFi-2D therefore needs to be coupled with
an unstructured CFD solver that is used to discretize the governing PDEs within the smooth regions
of the flow-field. Two different, in-house developed, CFD solvers are also included in the current
distribution. The main features of the UnDiFi-2D software can be summarized as follows: Programming
Language: UnDiFi-2D is written in standard Fortran 77/95; its design is highly modular in order
to enhance simplicity of use, maintenance and allow coupling with virtually any existing CFD solver;
Usability, Maintenance and Enhancement: In order to improve the usability, maintenance and enhancement
of the code also the documentation has been carefully taken into account. The git distributed versioning
system has been adopted to facilitate collaborative maintenance and code development; Copyrights:
UnDiFi-2D is a free software that anyone can use, copy, distribute, change and improve under the
GNU Public License version 3. The present paper is a manifesto of the first public release of the UnDiFi-2D
code. It describes the currently implemented features, which are the result of more than a decade
of still ongoing CFD developments. This work is focused on the computational techniques adopted
and a detailed description of the main characteristics is reported. UnDiFi-2D capabilities are
demonstrated by means of examples test cases. The design of the code allows to easily include existing
CFD codes and is aimed at ease code reuse and readability.

Strategies adopted globally to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 have primarily involved lockdown
measures with substantial economic and social costs with varying degrees of success. Morbidity
patterns of COVID-19 variants have a strong association with age, while restrictive lockdown measures
have association with negative mental health outcomes in some age groups. Reduced economic prospects
may also afflict some age cohorts more than others. Motivated by this, we propose a model to describe
COVID-19 community spread incorporating the role of age-specific social interactions. Through
a flexible parameterisation of an age-structured deterministic Susceptible Exposed Infectious
Removed (SEIR) model, we provide a means for characterising different forms of lockdown which may
impact specific age groups differently. Social interactions are represented through age group
to age group contact matrices, which can be trained using available data and are thus locally adapted.
This framework is easy to interpret and suitable for describing counterfactual scenarios, which
could assist policy makers with regard to minimising morbidity balanced with the costs of prospective
suppression strategies. Our work originates from an Irish context and we use disease monitoring
data from February 29th 2020 to January 31st 2021 gathered by Irish governmental agencies. We demonstrate
how Irish lockdown scenarios can be constructed using the proposed model formulation and show results
of retrospective fitting to incidence rates and forward planning with relevant ``what if/instead
of'' lockdown counterfactuals with uncertainty quantification. Our formulation is agnostic
to a specific locale, in that lockdown strategies in other regions can be straightforwardly encoded
using this model. The methods we describe are made publicly available online through an accessible
and easy to use web interface.

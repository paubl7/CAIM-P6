Electric generators convert external energy into electricity and is the foundation of power station
and energy harvesting operation. Inevitably, the external source supplies a force per unit charge
to free or bound charge, which produces AC electricity. The external impressed force acts outside
Maxwell's equations and supplies a non-conservative electric action generating an oscillating
electrodynamic degree of freedom. In this work we analyze the electrodynamics of ideal free and
bound charge electricity generators from a time dependent permanent polarization, which exists
without any applied electric field, essential to oscillate free or bound charge in a lossless way.
For both cases Faraday's law is modified through the addition of an effective impressed magnetic
current boundary source. For the free charge case, we highlight the example of an electromagnetic
generator based on Lorentz force, where the impressed force per unit charge comes from mechanical
motion of free electrons with an impressed velocity of a conductor relative to a stationary DC magnetic
field. The bound charge generator is simply an idealized permanently polarized bar electret. We
consider the general case of a time dependent permanent polarization, the underlying principle
behind piezoelectric nano-generators. In the open circuit state, both electricity generators
are equivalent to idealized Hertzian dipoles, with the open circuit voltage equal to the induced
emf. Analyzing the short circuit responses, we show that the bound charge electricity generator
has a capacitive source impedance. In contrast, for the ideal free charge electricity generator,
the back emf from the inductance of the loop that defines the short circuit, directly cancels the
source emf, so the voltage across the inductor is determined by the magnetic current boundary source
and equal to the time rate of change of generated magnetic flux.

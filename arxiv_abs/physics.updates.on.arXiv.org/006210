Turbulence and large-scale waves in the tropical region are studied using the spherical shallow
water equations. With mesoscale vorticity forcing, both moist and dry systems show kinetic energy
scaling that is dominated by rotational modes, has a -5/3 exponent. At larger planetary scales,
the divergent component of the energy increases and we see a footprint of tropical waves. The dry
system shows a signature of the entire family of equatorial waves, while the moist simulations only
show low frequency Rossby, Kelvin and mixed Rossby gravity waves with an equivalent depth that matches
rapid condensation estimates. Further, runs with interactive moisture exhibit spontaneous aggregation
with the equilibrium moist energy spectrum obeying a -2 power-law. Synoptic scale moisture anomalies
form in heterogeneous background saturation, and are sustained by advection and convergence,
within rotational gyres that dominate the tropical region. In that case, along with equatorial
waves and turbulence, a large-scale eastward moving moisture wave appears in the midlatitudes.
In all simulations with upscale energy transfer, a systematic equatorial zonal mean zonal flow
develops which is easterly and westerly for the dry and moist ensembles, respectively.The interaction
of this zonal mean flow with a spatially heterogeneous saturation field results in the formation
of a moist stationary tropical wave. The super-rotating flow is driven by rotational eddy momentum
fluxes due to enhanced equatorial Rossby wave activity in the moist runs. The nature of eddies is
such that the tropical circulation in the dry and moist cases tends to homogenize and exaggerate
potential vorticity gradients, respectively. These experiments demonstrate the co-existence
of tropical waves and turbulence, and highlight the fact that the vortical and divergent wind are
inextricably linked with the evolving moisture field.

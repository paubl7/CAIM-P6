The X-ray free-electron lasers that became available during the last decade, like the European
XFEL (EuXFEL), place high demands on their instrumentation. Especially at low photon energies
below $1\,\text{keV}$, detectors with high sensitivity, and consequently low noise and high quantum
efficiency, are required to enable facility users to fully exploit the scientific potential of
the photon source. A 1-Megapixel pnCCD detector with a $1024\times 1024$ pixel format has been installed
and commissioned for imaging applications at the Nano-Sized Quantum System (NQS) station of the
Small Quantum System (SQS) instrument at EuXFEL. The instrument is currently operating in the energy
range between $0.5$ and $3\,\text{keV}$ and the NQS station is designed for investigations of the
interaction of intense FEL pulses with clusters, nano-particles and small bio-molecules, by combining
photo-ion and photo-electron spectroscopy with coherent diffraction imaging techniques. The
core of the imaging detector is a pn-type charge coupled device (pnCCD) with a pixel pitch of $75\,\mu\text{m}\times
75\,\mu\text{m}$. Depending on the experimental scenario, the pnCCD enables imaging of single
photons thanks to its very low electronic noise of $3$e$^-$ and high quantum efficiency. Here we
present an overview on the EuXFEL pnCCD detector and the results from the commissioning and first
user operation at the SQS experiment in June 2019. The detailed descriptions of the detector design
and capabilities, its implementation at EuXFEL both mechanically and from the controls side as
well as important data correction steps aim to provide useful background for users planning and
analyzing experiments at EuXFEL and may serve as a benchmark for comparing and planning future endstations
at other FELs.

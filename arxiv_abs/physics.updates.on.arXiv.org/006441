The Covid-19 pandemic has strained the hospital systems in many countries in the world, especially
in developing countries. In many low-resource hospitals, severely ill hypoxemic Covid-19 patients
are treated with various forms of low-flow oxygen therapy (0-15 L/min), including interfaces such
as a nasal cannula, Hudson mask, venturi-mask, and non-rebreather masks. When 15L/min of pure oxygen
flow is not sufficient for the patient, treatment guidelines suggest non-invasive positive pressure
ventilation (NIPPV) or high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) as the next stage of treatment. However,
administering HFNO in the general wards of a low-resource hospital is difficult due to several factors,
including difficulty in operation, unavailability of electric power outlets, and frequent maintenance.
Therefore, in many cases, the highest level of care a patient receives in the general ward is 15L/min
of oxygen on a Non-Rebreather Mask. With a shortage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, this is a major
problem since intermediate forms of treatments are simply not available at an affordable cost.
To address this gap, we have developed a low-cost CPAP system specifically designed for low-resource
hospitals. The device is a precision venturi-based flow-generator capable of providing up to 60L/min
of flow. The device utilizes the mechanics of a jet pump driven by high-pressure oxygen to increase
the volumetric flow rate by entraining atmospheric air. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)
can be attained between 40 - 100% using a dual-flowmeter. Consisting of a traditional 22mm breathing
circuit, a non-vented CPAP mask, and a Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) valve, the CPAP
can provide positive pressures between 5-20 cm H2O. The device is manufactured using local 3D printing
and workshop facilities.

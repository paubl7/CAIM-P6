Since the introduction of the radio-frequency (rf) photoinjector electron source over thirty
years ago, peak performance demands have dictated the use of high accelerating electric fields.
With recent strong advances in obtainable field values, attendant increases in beam brightness
are expected to be dramatic. In this article, we examine the implementation of very high gradient
acceleration in a high frequency, cryogenic rf photoinjector. We discuss in detail the effects
of introducing, through an optimized rf cavity shape, rich spatial harmonic content in the accelerating
modes in this device. Higher spatial harmonics give useful, enhanced linear focusing effects,
as well as potentially deleterious nonlinear transverse forces. They also serve to strongly increase
the ratio of average accelerating field to peak surface field, thus aiding in managing power and
dark current-related challenges. We investigate two scenarios which are aimed at unique exploitation
of the capabilities of this source. First, we investigate the obtaining of extremely high six-dimensional
brightness for advanced free-electron laser applications. We also examine the use of a magnetized
photocathode in the device for producing unprecedented low asymmetric emittance, high-current
electron beams that reach linear collider-compatible performance. As both of the scenarios demand
an advanced, compact solenoid design, we describe a novel cryogenic solenoid system. With the high
field rf and magnetostatic structures introduced, we analyze the collective beam dynamics in these
systems through theory and multi-particle simulations, including a particular emphasis on granularity
effects associated with microscopic Coulomb interactions.

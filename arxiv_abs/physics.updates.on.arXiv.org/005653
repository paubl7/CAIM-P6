Studies of flow through the human airway have shown that inhalation time (IT) and secondary flow
structures can play important roles in particle deposition. However, the effects of varying IT
in conjunction with respiratory rate (RR) on airway flow remain unknown. Using 3D numerical simulations
of oscillatory flow through an idealized airway model consisting of a mouth inlet, glottis, trachea
and symmetric double bifurcation at trachea Reynolds number ($Re$) of 4,200, we investigated how
varying the ratio of IT to breathing time (BT) from 25% to 50% and RR from 10 breaths per minute (bpm)
corresponding to Womersley number ($Wo$) of 2.37 to 1,000 bpm ($Wo$=23.7) impacts airway flow characteristics.
Irrespective of IT/BT, axial flow during inhalation at tracheal cross-sections was non-uniform
for $Wo$=2.37 as compared to centrally concentrated distribution for $Wo$=23.7. For a given $Wo$
and IT/BT, both axial and secondary (lateral) flow components unevenly split between left and right
branches of a bifurcation. Irrespective of $Wo$, IT/BT and airway generation, lateral dispersion
was stronger than axial flow streaming. Despite left-right symmetry of the lower airway in our model,
the right-sided mouth-to-glottis portion generated turbulence in the upper airway. Varying IT/BT
for a given $Wo$ did not noticeably change flow characteristics. Discrepancy in the oscillatory
flow relation $Re$/$Wo^2$=2$L$/$D$ ($L$=stroke length; $D$=trachea diameter) was observed
for IT/BT$\neq$50%, as $L$ changed with IT/BT. We developed a modified dimensionless stroke length
term including IT/BT. While viscous forces and convective acceleration were dominant for lower
$Wo$, unsteady acceleration was dominant for higher $Wo$.

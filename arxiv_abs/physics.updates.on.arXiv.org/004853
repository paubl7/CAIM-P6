Magnetic flux generated within the solar interior emerges to the surface, forming active regions
(ARs) and sunspots. Flux emergence may trigger explosive events, such as flares and coronal mass
ejections and therefore understanding emergence is useful for space-weather forecasting. Evidence
of any pre-emergence signatures will also shed light on sub-surface processes responsible for
emergence. In this paper, we present a first analysis of emerging ARs from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic
Emerging Active Regions (SDO/HEAR) dataset (Schunker et al. 2016) using deep convolutional neural
networks (CNN) to characterize pre-emergence surface magnetic-field properties. The trained
CNN classifies between pre-emergence (PE) line-of-sight magnetograms and a control set of non-emergence
(NE) magnetograms with a True Skill Statistic (TSS) score of ~85%, 3h prior to emergence and ~40\%,
24h prior to emergence. Our results are better than a baseline classification TSS obtained using
discriminant analysis of only the unsigned magnetic flux. We develop a network pruning algorithm
to interpret the trained CNN and show that the CNN incorporates filters that respond positively
as well as negatively to the unsigned magnetic flux of the magnetograms. Using synthetic magnetograms,
we demonstrate that the CNN output is sensitive to the length-scale of the magnetic regions with
small-scale and intense fields producing maximum CNN output and possibly a characteristic pre-emergence
pattern. Given increasing popularity of deep learning, techniques developed here for interpretation
of the trained CNN -- using network pruning and synthetic data -- are relevant for future applications
in solar and astrophysical data analysis.

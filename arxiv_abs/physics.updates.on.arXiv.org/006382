Due to its high lethality amongst the elderly, nursing homes are in the eye of the COVID-19 storm.
With test procedures becoming available at scale, such as antigen or RT-LAMP tests, and increasing
availability of vaccinations, nursing homes might be able to safely relax prohibitory measures
while controlling the spread of infections (meaning an average of one or less secondary infections
per index case). Here, we develop a novel agent-based epidemiological model for the spread of SARS-CoV-2
in nursing homes to identify optimal prevention strategies. The model is microscopically calibrated
to high-resolution data from nursing homes in Austria, including the detailed networks of social
contacts of their residents and information on past outbreaks. We find that the effectiveness of
mitigation testing depends critically on the timespan between test and test result, the detection
threshold of the viral load for the test to give a positive result, and the screening frequencies
of residents and employees. Under realistic conditions and in absence of an effective vaccine,
we find that preventive screening of employees only might be sufficient to control outbreaks in
nursing homes, provided that turnover times and detection thresholds of the tests are low enough.
If vaccines that are moderately effective against infection and transmission are available, control
is achieved if 80% or more of inhabitants are vaccinated, even if no preventive testing is in place
and residents are allowed to have visitors. Since these results strongly depend on vaccine efficacy
against infection, retention of testing infrastructures, regular voluntary screening and sequencing
of virus genomes is advised to enable early identification of new variants of concern.

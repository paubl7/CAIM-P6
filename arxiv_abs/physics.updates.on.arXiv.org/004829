The sojourn probability of an It\^o diffusion process, that is its probability to remain in the tubular
neighborhood of a smooth path, is a central quantity in the study of path probabilities. Previous
works considered the sojourn probability in the limit of vanishing tube radius, and employed the
metric induced by the diffusion tensor, rather than that of the ambient space, to define the tube
enclosing the smooth path. This presents two difficulties in experimentally measuring sojourn
probabilities: first, the state-dependence of the diffusion tensor is not known apriori, and second,
the limit has to be accessed through a sequence of measurements at finite tube radius. Here we circumvent
these difficulties by obtaining a general expression for the sojourn probability of $N$-dimensional
It\^o processes in tubes whose radii are small but finite, and fixed by the metric of the ambient Euclidean
space. The central quantity in our study is the rate at which trajectories leave the tube for the first
time. This has an interpretation as a Lagrangian and can be measured directly in experiment. We find
that this Lagrangian differs, in general, from the Onsager-Machlup Lagrangian and has a form not
previously reported in the literature. We confirm our result by comparing to numerical simulations
for a one-dimensional diffusion process with state-dependent diffusivity. We demonstrate that
the most probable tube for a barrier crossing depends sensitively on the tube radius. We find that
that while in the limit of vanishing tube radius the ratio of sojourn probabilities for a pair of distinct
paths is in general divergent, the same for a path and its time-reversal is always convergent and
finite. This provides, in turn, a pathwise definition of irreversibility for It\^o processes that
is agnostic to the state-dependence of the diffusion tensor.

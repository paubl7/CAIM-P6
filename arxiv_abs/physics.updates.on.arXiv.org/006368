In 2019, aviation was responsible for 2.6% of world CO2 emissions as well as additional climate impacts
such as contrails. Like all industrial sectors, the aviation sector must implement measures to
reduce its climate impact. This paper focuses on the simulation and evaluation of climate scenarios
for air transport. For this purpose, a specific tool (CAST for "Climate and Aviation - Sustainable
Trajectories") has been developed at ISAE-SUPAERO. This tool follows a methodology for the assessment
of climate impacts adapted to aviation. Firstly, models for the main levers of action, such as air
traffic, aircraft energy consumption and energy decarbonization, are provided using trend projections
from historical data or assumptions from the literature. Second, the evaluation of scenarios is
based on aviation carbon budgets, which are also extended to non-CO2 effects using the concept of
GWP*. Several scenario analyses are performed in this paper using CAST allowing different conclusions
to be drawn. For instance, the modelling of the scenarios based on the more recent ATAG (Air Transport
Action Group) commitments shows that aviation would consume 6.5% of the world carbon budget for
+1.5{\deg}C. Some illustrative scenarios are also proposed. By allocating 2.6% of the world carbon
budget to aviation, it is shown that air transport is compatible with a +2{\deg}C trajectory when
the annual growth rate of air traffic varies between -1.8% and +2.9%, depending on the technological
improvements considered. However, using the same methodology for a +1.5{\deg}C trajectory shows
that a drastic decrease in air traffic is necessary. Lastly, analyses including non-CO2 effects
emphasize the importance of implementing specific strategies for mitigating contrails.

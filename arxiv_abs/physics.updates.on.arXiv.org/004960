The coincidence of a pitchfork and Hopf bifurcation at a Takens-Bogdanov (TB) bifurcation occurs
in many physical systems such as double-diffusive convection, binary convection and magnetoconvection.
Analysis of the associated normal form, in one dimension with periodic boundary condition, shows
the existence of steady patterns, standing waves, modulated waves and travelling waves, where
the values of coefficients of the terms in the normal form classify all possible different bifurcation
scenarios in the neighbourhood of the TB bifurcation (Dangelmayr & Knobloch, 1987). In this work
we develop a new and simple pattern-forming PDE model, based on the Swift-Hohenberg equation, adapted
to have the TB normal form at onset, which allows us to explore the dynamics in a wide range of bifurcation
scenarios, including in domains much wider than the lengthscale of the pattern. We identify two
bifurcation scenarios in which coexistence between different types of solutions is indicated
from the analysis of the normal form equation. In these scenarios, we look for spatially localised
solutions by examining pattern formation in wide domains. We recover two types of localised states,
that of a localised steady state in the background of the trivial state and that of a spatially localised
travelling wave in the background of the trivial state which have previously been observed in other
systems. Additionally, we identify two new types of spatially localised states: that of a localised
steady state in a modulated wave background and that of a localised travelling wave in a steady state
background. The PDE model is easy to solve numerically in large domains and so will allow further
investigation of pattern formation with a TB bifurcation in one or more dimensions and the exploration
of a range of background and foreground pattern combinations beyond steady states.

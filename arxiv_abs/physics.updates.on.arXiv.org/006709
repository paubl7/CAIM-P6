Purpose: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) suffers from eddy currents induced by strong diffusion gradients,
which introduce artefacts that can impair subsequent diffusion metric analysis. Existing retrospective
correction techniques that correct for diffusion gradient induced eddy currents do not account
for eddy current decay, which is generally effective for traditional Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo
(PGSE) diffusion encoding. However, these techniques do not necessarily apply to advanced forms
of dMRI that require substantial gradient slewing, such as Oscillating Gradient Spin Echo (OGSE).
Methods: An in-house algorithm (TVEDDY), that for the first time retrospectively models eddy current
decay, was tested on PGSE and OGSE brain images acquired at 7T. Correction performance was compared
to conventional correction methods by evaluating the mean-squared error (MSE) between diffusion-weighted
images acquired with opposite polarity diffusion gradients. As a ground truth comparison, images
were corrected using field dynamics up to third order in space measured using a field monitoring
system. Results: Time-varying eddy currents were observed for OGSE, which introduced blurring
that was not reduced using the traditional approach but was diminished considerably with TVEDDY
and model-based reconstruction. No MSE difference was observed between the conventional approach
and TVEDDY for PGSE, but for OGSE TVEDDY resulted in significantly lower MSE than the conventional
approach. The field-monitoring-informed model-based reconstruction had the lowest MSE for both
PGSE and OGSE. Conclusion: This work establishes that it is possible to estimate time-varying eddy
currents from the diffusion data itself, which provides substantial image quality improvements
for gradient-intensive dMRI acquisitions like OGSE.

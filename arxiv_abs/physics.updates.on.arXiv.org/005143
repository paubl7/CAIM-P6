Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is one of the most important contemporary non-invasive
modalities for probing tissue structure at the microscopic scale. The majority of dMRI techniques
employ standard single diffusion encoding (SDE) measurements, covering different sequence parameter
ranges depending on the complexity of the method. Although many signal representations and biophysical
models have been proposed for SDE data, they are intrinsically limited by a lack of specificity.
Advanced dMRI methods have been proposed to provide additional microstructural information beyond
what can be inferred from SDE. These enhanced contrasts can play important roles in characterizing
biological tissues, for instance upon diseases (e.g. neurodegenerative, cancer, stroke), aging,
learning, and development. In this review we focus on double diffusion encoding (DDE), which stands
out among other advanced acquisitions for its versatility, ability to probe more specific diffusion
correlations, and feasibility for preclinical and clinical applications. Various DDE methodologies
have been employed to probe compartment sizes (Section 3), decouple the effects of microscopic
diffusion anisotropy from orientation dispersion (Section 4), probe displacement correlations,
study exchange, or suppress fast diffusing compartments (Section 6). DDE measurements can also
be used to improve the robustness of biophysical models (Section 5) and study intra-cellular diffusion
via magnetic resonance spectroscopy of metabolites (Section 7). This review discusses all these
topics as well as important practical aspects related to the implementation and contrast in preclinical
and clinical settings (Section 9) and aims to provide the readers a guide for deciding on the right
DDE acquisition for their specific application.

In this thesis we address a series of new problems in non-hermitian optical scattering with increasing
degrees of complexity. We develop the theory of reflectionless scattering modes, introducing
a novel and broad class of impedance-matched eigenproblems: for a given structure, find the incident
wavefronts and frequencies which are not partially reflected, but are instead transmitted through
the scatterer, or dissipated within it. We analyze the relevant symmetry properties, and find that
they support exceptional points (EPs) which can be directly probed with steady-state excitation.
We study degenerate coherent perfect absorption (CPA EP), which is a specific example of the new
kind of EP mentioned above. We show that the CPA EP is chiral in a ring resonator, and use this to design
a resonator which predominantly absorbs or reflects light, depending on the direction of incidence.
We extend CPA from cavities with a linear dielectric response to include the saturating nonlinearity
and dispersion of a two-level absorbing medium. We show that the SALT algorithm in the single-mode
regime can also be used to find the saturable CPA modes through a simple mapping. We also clarify the
bad-cavity limit of dispersive but linear CPA, identifying new modes that are hybrids of the cavity
and atomic degrees of freedom. We present and solve the general problem of scattering from an arbitrary
cavity with a saturable two-level amplifying or absorbing medium, generalizing the known phenomenology
of bistability that has mainly been studied in structures with little or no spatial complexity.
We carefully analyze the validity of approximations used for isolated resonances, and find that
the previously used inverse single-pole approximation requires some modification for the case
of scattering.

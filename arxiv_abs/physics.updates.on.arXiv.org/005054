Atherosclerosis, a chronic lesion of vascular wall, remains a leading cause of death and loss of
life years. Classical hypotheses for atherosclerosis are long-standing mainly to explain atherogenesis.
Unfortunately, these hypotheses may not explain the variation in the susceptibility to atherosclerosis.
These issues are controversial over the past 150 years. Atherosclerosis from human coronary arteries
was examined and triangle of media was found to be a true portraiture of cells injury in the media,
and triangle of intima was a true portraiture of myofibroblast proliferation, extracellular matrix
(ECM) secretion, collagen fiber formation and intimal thickening to repair media dysfunction.
Myofibroblasts, ECM and lumen (intima)/vasa vasorum (VV) (adventitia) constitute granulation
tissue repair. With granulation tissue hyperplasia, lots of collagen fibers (normal or denatured),
foam cells and new capillaries formed. Thus, the following theory was postulated: Risk factors
induce smooth muscle cells (SMCs) injury/loss, and fibrosis or structure destruction could be
developed in the media, which lead to media dysfunction. Media dysfunction prompts disturbed mechanical
properties of blood vessels, resulting in bigger pressure buildup in the intima and adventitia.
Granulation tissues in the intima/adventitia develop to repair the injured media. Atherosclerosis,
stiffening or aneurysm develops depending on media dysfunction severity and granulated tissue
repair mode/degree. Nearly all characteristics of clinical atherosclerosis could be ideally
interpreted with the theory. We believe that media dysfunction is a key initiator in the pathogenesis
of atherosclerosis. It is expected that media dysfunction theory of atherosclerosis, should offer
better understanding of the etiology for atherosclerosis.

Objective: We propose a novel approach for modelling the inter-dependence of electrical and mechanical
phenomena in nervous cells, by using electro-thermal equivalences in finite element (FE) analysis
so that existing thermo-mechanical tools can be applied. Methods: First, the equivalence between
electrical and thermal properties of the nerve materials is established, and results of a pure heat
conduction analysis performed in Abaqus CAE Software 6.13-3 are validated with analytical solutions
for a range of steady and transient conditions. This validation includes the definition of equivalent
active membrane properties that enable prediction of the action potential. Then, as a step towards
fully coupled models, electromechanical coupling is implemented through the definition of equivalent
piezoelectric properties of the nerve membrane using the thermal expansion coefficient, enabling
prediction of the mechanical response of the nerve to the action potential. Results: Results of
the coupled electro-mechanical model are validated with previously published experimental results
of deformation for the squid giant axon, crab nerve fibre and garfish olfactory nerve fibre. Conclusion:
A simplified coupled electro-mechanical modelling approach is established through an electro-thermal
equivalent FE model of a nervous cell for biomedical applications. Significance: One of the key
findings is the mechanical characterization of the neural activity in a coupled electro-mechanical
domain, which provides insights into the electromechanical behaviour of nervous cells, such as
thinning of the membrane. This is a first step towards modelling 3D electromechanical alteration
induced by trauma at nerve bundle, tissue and organ levels.

The study of the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs) in astronomical environments has opened interesting
spectroscopic questions on the effect of anharmonicity on the infrared (IR) spectrum of hot polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and related species in isolated conditions. The forthcoming James
Webb Space Telescope will unveil unprecedented spatial and spectral details in the AIB spectrum;
significant advancement is thus necessary now to model the infrared emission of PAHs, their presumed
carriers, with enough detail to exploit the information content of the AIBs. This requires including
anharmonicity in such models, and to do so systematically for all species included, requiring a
difficult compromise between accuracy and efficiency. We performed a benchmark study to compare
the performances of two methods in calculating anharmonic spectra, comparing them to available
experimental data. One is a full quantum method, AnharmoniCaOs, relying on an ab initio potential,
and the other relies on Molecular Dynamics simulations using a Density Functional based Tight Binding
potential. The first one is found to be very accurate and detailed, but it becomes computationally
very expensive for increasing temperature; the second is faster and can be used for arbitrarily
high temperatures, but is less accurate. Still, its results can be used to model the evolution with
temperature of isolated bands. We propose a new recipe to model anharmonic AIB emission using minimal
assumptions on the general behaviour of band positions and widths with temperature, which can be
defined by a small number of empirical parameters. Modelling accuracy will depend critically on
these empirical parameters, allowing for an incremental improvement in model results, as better
estimates become gradually available.

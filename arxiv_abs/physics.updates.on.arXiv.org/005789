A couple of dozen Earth-like planets orbiting M dwarfs have been discovered so far. Some of them have
attracted interest because of their potential long-term habitability. I show that the General
Theory of Relativity (GTR) predicts spin precessions which, to the post-Newtonian (pN) order,
may impact the habitability of a fictitious telluric planet orbiting a late M dwarf with $M_\star=0.08\,M_\odot$
at $a=0.02\,\mathrm{au}$, corresponding to an orbital period $P_\mathrm{b}\simeq 4\,\mathrm{d}$,
inducing long-term variations of the obliquity $\varepsilon$ of its spin $\boldsymbol S$ which,
under certain circumstances, may not be deemed as negligible from the point of view of life's sustainability.
I analytically derive the orbit-averaged equations of the pN precessions of the polar angles $\theta,\,\alpha$
of $\boldsymbol{\hat{S}}$ and of the orbital inclination $I$ and node $\Omega$ entering $\varepsilon$,
and numerically integrate them by producing time series of the pN changes $\Delta\varepsilon(t)$
of the obliquity. For rapidly rotating M dwarfs with rotational periods of the order of $P_\star
\simeq 0.1-1\,\mathrm{d}$, the planet's obliquity $\varepsilon$ can undergo pN large variations
$\Delta\varepsilon(t)$ up to tens of degrees over timescales $\Delta t \simeq 20-200\,\mathrm{kyr}$,
depending on the mutual orientations of the star's spin ${\boldsymbol J}_\star$, of $\boldsymbol
S$, and of the orbital angular momentum $\boldsymbol L$. Instead, $\Delta\varepsilon(t)$ are
$\lesssim 1-1.5^\circ$ for the planet b of the Teegarden's Star. GTR should be considered one of
the key factors to be taken into account in compiling budgets of the long-term habitability of rocky
planets around fast spinning late M dwarfs. My approach can be extended also to other astronomical
scenarios where features of the target bodies other than their habitability are of interest.

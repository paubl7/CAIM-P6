Enhanced sampling and free energy calculation algorithms of the Thermodynamic Integration family
(such as the Adaptive Biasing Force method, ABF) are not based on the direct computation of a free
energy surface, but rather of its gradient. Integrating the free energy surface is non-trivial
in dimension higher than one. Here I introduce a flexible, portable implementation of a Poisson
equation formalism to integrate free energy surfaces from estimated gradients in dimension 2 and
3, using any combination of periodic and non-periodic (Neumann) boundary conditions. The algorithm
is implemented in portable C++, and provided as a standalone tool that can be used to integrate multidimensional
gradient fields estimated on a grid using any algorithm. It is also included in the implementation
of ABF (and its extended-system variant eABF) in the Collective Variables Module, enabling the
seamless computation of multidimensional free energy surfaces within ABF and eABF simulations.
A Python-based analysis toolchain is provided to easily plot and analyze multidimensional ABF
simulation results, including metrics to assess their convergence. The Poisson integration algorithm
can also be used to perform Helmholtz decomposition of noisy gradients estimates on the fly, resulting
in an efficient implementation of the projected ABF (pABF) method proposed by Leli\`evre and co-workers.
In numerical tests, pABF is found to lead to faster convergence with respect to ABF in simple cases
of low intrinsic dimension, but seems detrimental to convergence in a more realistic case involving
degenerate coordinates and hidden barriers, due to slower exploration. This suggests that variance
reduction schemes do not always yield convergence improvements when applied to enhanced sampling
methods.

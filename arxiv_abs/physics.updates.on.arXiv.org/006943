In an impingement atomizer, a thin sheet of liquid generates by impinging two identical jets. The
thickness is one of the most crucial parameters in quantifying the spray characteristics for which
several non-unique solutions have been acquired theoretically, so far. Among all, three theoretical
solutions presented by Hasson and Peck, Ranz, and Miller are the most reliable expressions in terms
of precision. Apparently, all these distinctive solutions cannot be physical simultaneously.
However, a theoretical satisfactory explanation for having various non-unique solutions has
not been presented. Moreover, a meaningful criterion to recognize the most physical solution is
highly desirable. To address this gap, it is hypothesized that an additional constraint should
be considered in couple with the continuity and momentum equations to have a unique prediction for
the liquid sheet thickness. By employing the minimum energy principle, the minimum stored energy
in the liquid sheet is considered the crucial constraint to achieving a unique solution and rejecting
non-physical ones. Since the inviscid flow assumption is reasonably valid for the liquid sheet,
the minimum energy principle satisfies when the minimum lateral surface predicts. To quantify
the lateral surface area the sheet shape is presented in terms of the sheet thickness and numerically
calculated by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for the three mentioned expressions. Using
the liquid shape, the lateral surface areas are calculated and compared in three different impingement
angles of 58, 89, and 117 degrees. In addition, the liquid shapes are visually compared with the experimental
results obtained by the Shadowgraph technique. In sum, it is proved that Hasson and Peck presented
the most physical solution for the liquid sheet thickness.

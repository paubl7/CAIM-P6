An airplane flying at constant speed and altitude is an example of physics invisible to the pilots
and passengers, but visible to remote observers and manifest in the mathematics. The optimum flight
path is an arc of a Great Circle, specifically that circle which is the result of rotating the equator
to intersect the origin and destination airports. In order that the velocity vector remain parallel
to the surface of the spherical earth, a centripetal force is required to rotate the velocity without
altering its magnitude. This force must be radially inward and thus parallel to the local vertical.
The assertion that ``lift balances gravity" is only an approximation. To follow the curve of the
earth, the vertical component of aerodynamic lift must be \emph{slightly weaker} than gravity
so that the plane can be in ``orbitfall". That is, to follow the curvature of the earth, maintaining
a constant distance $R$ from the center of the earth while flying at a constant speed $V$ and generating
a vertical lift per unit mass $L$, the plane and all inside it must fall towards the center of the earth
with an acceleration, the ``orbitfall acceleration", $g_{orbitfall} \equiv g-L=V^{2} / R$ where
$g$ is the usual gravitational acceleration constant. If the plane travels a fraction $\digamma$
of the earth's circumference , then it must execute $\digamma$ of an outside loop. This requires
that the pitch angle $\xi$ must rotate nose-down at a rate of $d \xi / dt=V/R$. The dynamic stability
of a non-military aircraft makes this pitch change continuously without pilot intervention: the
horizontal stabilizers act as weathervanes, suppressing small perturbations so that the longitudinal
axis remains at a constant angle of attack. Neither pilot nor passenger is aware of the orbitfall
or the automatic pitch changes -- physics invisible but essential.

The design and application of an instrumented particle for the lagrangian characterization of
turbulent free surface flows is presented in this study. This instrumented particle constitutes
a local measurement device capable of measuring both its instantaneous 3D translational acceleration
and angular velocity components, as well as recording them on an embarked removeable memory card.
A lithium ion polymer battery provides the instrumented particle with up to 8 hours of autonomous
operation. Entirely composed of commercial off the shelf electronic components, it features accelerometer
and gyroscope sensors with a resolution of 16 bits for each individual axis, and maximum data acquisition
rates of 1 and 8 kHz, respectively, as well as several user programmable dynamic ranges. Its ABS 3D
printed body takes the form of a 36 mm diameter hollow sphere, and has a total mass of (19.6 $\pm$ 0.5)
g. Controlled experiments, carried out to calibrate and validate its performance showed good agreement
when compared to reference techniques. In order to assess the practicality of the instrumented
particle, we apply it to the statistical characterization of floater dynamics in experiments of
surface wave turbulence. In this feasibility study, we focused our attention on the distribution
of acceleration and angular velocity fluctuations as a function of the forcing intensity. The IP's
motion is also simultaneously registered by a 3D particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) system, for
the purposes of comparison. Beyond the results particular to this study case, it constitutes a proof
of both the feasibility and potentiality of the IP as a tool for the experimental characterization
of particle dynamics in such flows.

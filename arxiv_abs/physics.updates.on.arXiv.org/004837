This work justifies the paradigmatic importance of viscoelastic subdiffusion in random environments
for cellular biological systems. This model displays several remarkable features, which makes
it an attractive paradigm to explain the physical nature of biological subdiffusion. In particular,
it combines viscoelasticity with distinct non-ergodic features. We extend this model to make it
suitable for the subdiffusion of lipids in disordered biological membranes upon including the
inertial effects. For lipids, the inertial effects occur in the range of picoseconds, and a power-law
decaying viscoelastic memory extends over the range of several nanoseconds. Thus, in the absence
of disorder, diffusion would become normal on a time scale beyond this memory range. However, both
experimentally and in some molecular-dynamical simulations, the time range of lipid subdiffusion
extends far beyond the viscoelastic memory range. We study three 1d models of correlated quenched
Gaussian disorder to explain the puzzle: singular short-range (exponentially correlated), smooth
short-range (Gaussian-correlated), and smooth long-range (power-law correlated) disorder.
For a moderate disorder strength, transient viscoelastic subdiffusion changes into the subdiffusion
caused by the randomness of the environment. It is characterized by a time-dependent power-law
exponent of subdiffusion, which can show nonmonotonous behavior, in agreement with some recent
molecular-dynamical simulations. Moreover, the spatial distribution of test particles in this
disorder-dominated regime is shown to be a non-Gaussian, exponential power distribution, which
also correlates well with molecular-dynamical findings and experiments. Furthermore, this subdiffusion
is nonergodic with single-trajectory averages showing a broad scatter, in agreement with experimental
observations for subdiffusion of various particles in living cells.

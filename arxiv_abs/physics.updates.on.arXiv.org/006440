A variety of agent-based models has been proposed to account for the emergence of coordinated collective
behavior of animal groups from simple interaction rules. A common, simplifying assumption of such
collective movement models, is the consideration of individual agents moving with a constant speed.
In this work we critically re-asses this assumption underlying a vast majority of collective movement
models. First, we show the omnipresent speed variability observed in different species of live
fish and artificial agents (RoboFish). Based on theoretical considerations accounting for inertia
and rotational friction, we derive a functional dependence of the turning response of individuals
on their instantaneous speed (confirmed by experimental data). We investigate how the interplay
of variable speed and speed-dependent turning affects self-organized collective behavior by
implementing an agent-based model which accounts for both effects. We show, that besides average
speed, the individual speed variability may have a dramatic impact on the emergent collective dynamics,
as two groups differing only in their speed variability, and being otherwise identical in all other
behavioral parameters, can be in two fundamentally different stationary states. We find that the
local coupling between group polarization and individual speed is strongest at the order-disorder
transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate a decrease in polarization with group size for groups
of individuals with variable speed, and a sudden decrease in mean individual speed at a critical
group size (N=4 for Voronoi interactions) linked to a topological transition from an all-to-all
to a distributed spatial interaction network. Overall, our work highlights the importance to account
for fundamental kinematic constraints in general, and variable speed in particular, when modeling
self-organized collective dynamics.

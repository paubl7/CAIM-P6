Microfluidics encompasses a wide variety of subfields that can often be combined or applied independently
of one another. Two such areas are droplet microfluidics and inertial microfluidics. The former
has seen growing use due to the advantage of droplets being individual reactors, allowing for compartmentalized
chemical synthesis, single-molecule assays, as well as single-cell sequencing. Inertial microfluidics
on the other hand has largely been focused on utilizing fluid inertia and the hydrodynamic forces
that arise to focus, order, and sort particles, such as beads and cells. However, such principles
have seen far less direct application to droplet manipulation, owing to a lack of physical studies
on the longitudinal inertial self-assembly of liquid droplets, which has limited the potential
unification of these fields. This study investigates how the parameters of channel geometry (asymmetric
serpentine vs straight), number density, confinement, inertia, and Marangoni forces independently
affect the self-assembly of droplet trains. Interestingly, we find that the traditional straight
wall geometry fails to achieve uniform spatial ordering while the asymmetric serpentine is able
to establish long-range ordering in continuous drop trains over distances that are at least 3 orders
of magnitude greater than the drop diameter. Such ordering is also achievable at low flow rates,
which is particularly well-suited to droplet microfluidic applications, such as ensuring sufficient
time for on-chip incubation and for individual drop screening or sorting. These insights further
the understanding of complex multiphase fluid dynamics and could enable more streamlined and integrated
droplet microfluidic platforms.

Effects of graphene oxide nanomaterials addition and oxidation level on ignition delay and burning
rate of ethanol droplets are experimentally investigated. Three graphene oxide samples are synthesized
and characterized. Separate high-speed OH* chemiluminescence and high-speed shadowgraphy images
are collected. The results suggest that increasing the loading concentration from 0 to 0.1% generally
increases the ignition delay, except for ethanol doped with the highly oxidized graphene. The probability
density function of the atomized baby droplet diameter, initial projected velocity, and length
of the projected trajectory are similar for all tested conditions and independent of the oxidation
level and loading concentration of the additives. The joint probability density function calculated
for the atomization-related parameters against one another suggests that the majority of the baby
droplets feature a relatively short lifetime, indicating they may potentially burn inside the
flame envelope. Using droplet surface regression curves versus time, the burning rate for periods
in which the atomization does not occur, and for the periods that the atomization is present are estimated.
The former burning rate is shown to enhance by increasing the loading concentration and reducing
the oxidation level of graphene. However, it is found that a maximum increase in the latter burning
rate for both loading concentrations occurs for ethanol doped with the graphene oxide that features
maximum amount of infrared radiation absorption. It is shown that relatively intense atomization
suppresses the mass loss. Doping ethanol with graphene oxide and increasing the loading concentration
from 0.01 to 0.1% enhances the overall burning rate, with a maximum enhancement of 8.4% pertaining
to addition of reduced oxidized graphene oxide and for the loading concentration of 0.1%.

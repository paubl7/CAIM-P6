A new horizontally explicit/vertically implicit (HEVI) time splitting scheme for atmospheric
modelling is introduced, for which the horizontal divergence terms are applied within the implicit
vertical substep. The new HEVI scheme is implemented in conjunction with a mixed mimetic spectral
element spatial discretisation and semi-implicit vertical time stepping scheme that both preserve
the skew-symmetric structure of the non-canonical Hamiltonian form of the equations of motion.
Within this context the new HEVI scheme allows for the exact balance of all energetic exchanges in
space and time. However since the choice of horizontal fluxes for which this balance is satisfied
is not consistent with the horizontal velocity at the end of the time level the scheme still admits
a temporal energy conservation error. Linearised eigenvalue analysis shows that similar to a fully
implicit method, the new HEVI scheme is neutrally stable for all buoyancy modes, and unlike a second
order trapezoidal HEVI scheme is stable for all acoustic modes below a certain horizontal CFL number.
The scheme is validated against standard test cases for both planetary and nonhydrostatic regimes.
For the planetary scale baroclinic instability test case, the new formulation exhibits a secondary
oscillation in the potential to kinetic energy power exchanges, with a temporal frequency approximately
four times that exhibited by a horizontally third order, vertically second order trapezoidal scheme.
For the nonhydrostatic test case, the vertical upwinding of the potential temperature diagnostic
equation is shown to reduce spurious oscillations without altering the energetics of the solution,
since this upwinding is performed in an energetically consistent manner. For this test case, which
is configured on an affine geometry, the exact balance of energy exchanges allows the model to run
stably without any form of dissipation.

Failure and fault slip in crystalline rocks is associated with dilation. When pore fluids are present
and drainage is insufficient, dilation leads to pore pressure drops, which in turn lead to strengthening
of the material. We conducted laboratory rock fracture experiments with direct in-situ fluid pressure
measurements which demonstrate that dynamic rupture propagation and fault slip can be stabilised
(i.e., become quasi-static) by such a dilatancy strengthening effect. We also observe that, for
the same effective pressures but lower pore fluid pressures, the stabilisation process may be arrested
when the pore fluid pressure approaches zero and vaporises, resulting in dynamic shear failure.
In case of a stable rupture, we witness continued prolonged slip after the main failure event that
is the result of pore pressure recharge of the fault zone. All our observations are quantitatively
explained by a spring-slider model combining slip-weakening behaviour, slip-induced dilation,
and pore fluid diffusion. Using our data in an inverse problem, we estimate the key parameters controlling
rupture stabilisation, fault dilation rate and fault zone storage. These estimates are used to
make predictions for the pore pressure drop associated with faulting, and where in the crust we may
expect dilatancy stabilisation or vaporisation during earthquakes. For intact rock and well consolidated
faults, we expect strong dilatancy strengthening between 4 and 6 km depth regardless of ambient
pore pressure, and at greater depths when the ambient pore pressure approaches lithostatic pressure.
In the uppermost part of the crust ($<4$ km), we predict vaporisation of pore fluids that limits dilatancy
strengthening. The depth estimates where dilatant stabilisation is most likely coincide with
geothermal energy reservoirs in crystalline rock and in regions where slow slip events are observed.

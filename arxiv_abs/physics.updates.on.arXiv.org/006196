In this paper, we propose a novel design and fabrication strategy to produce architected core structures
for use as the core in composite sandwich structures. A traditional foam core or honeycomb structure
is lightweight and stiff, but susceptible to local damage during impact events. Here we propose
the use of an architected structure composed of hollow truncated cone unit cells that exhibit structural
recovery in place of foams or honeycomb structures. These structures printed with a viscoelastic
material rely on buckling of their sidewalls to dissipate energy without permanent damage. We explore
the mechanical response of these conical unit cells in terms of their buckling strength and post-buckling
stability condition by relating them to non-dimensional geometric parameters {{\alpha}, {\beta},
{\gamma}}, where {\alpha} represents the slenderness of the curved sidewalls, {\beta} is the angle
of the sidewall to the base, and {\gamma} represents the curvature of the sidewall. A validated finite
element model is developed and used to investigate the effect of these parameters. We see that the
peak buckling load is directly proportional to both {\alpha} & {\beta} and is not dependent on {\gamma}
when the load is normalized by the volume of material in the curved sidewall. Interestingly, the
post-buckling stability is influenced by {\gamma}, or the initial curvature of the sidewall, where
a larger radius of curvature makes the structure less susceptible to exhibit structural bistability.
The structures presented here are printed using a viscoelastic material, that causes them to exhibit
pseudo-bistability, or a time-delayed recovery. This allows the structures to buckle and dissipate
energy, and then recover to their original configurations without the need for external stimuli
or energy.

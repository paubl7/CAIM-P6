COVID-19 has devastated the entire global community. Vaccines present an opportunity to mitigate
the pandemic; however, the effect of vaccination coupled with the behavioral response of the population
is not well understood. We propose a model that incorporates two important dynamically varying
population behaviors: level of caution and sense of safety. Level of caution increases with the
number of infectious cases, while an increasing sense of safety with increased vaccination lowers
precautionary behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that can effectively
reproduce the complete time history of COVID-19 infections for various regions of the United States
and provides relatable measures of dynamic changes in the population behavior and disease transmission
rates. We propose a parameter d_I as a direct measure of a population's caution against an infectious
disease, that can be obtained from the ongoing new infectious cases. The model provides a method
for quantitative measure of critical infectious disease attributes for a population including
highest disease transmission rate, effective disease transmission rate, and disease related
precautionary behavior. We predict future COVID-19 pandemic trends in the United States accounting
for vaccine rollout and behavioral response. Although a high rate of vaccination is critical to
quickly end the pandemic, we find that a return towards pre-pandemic social behavior due to increased
sense of safety during vaccine deployment, can cause an alarming surge in infections. Our results
indicate that at the current rate of vaccination, the new infection cases for COVID-19 in the United
States will approach zero by the end of August 2021. The model can be used for predicting future epidemic
and pandemic dynamics before and during vaccination.

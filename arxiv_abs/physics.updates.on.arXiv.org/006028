This text presents one of the first successful applications of a rare events method for the study
of multistability in a turbulent flow without stochastic energy injection. The trajectories of
collapse of turbulence in plane Couette flow, as well as their probability and rate of occurrence
are systematically computed using \emph{Adaptive Multilevel Splitting} (AMS). The AMS computations
are performed in a system of size $L_x\times L_z=24\times 18$ at Reynolds number $R=370$ with an
acceleration by a factor $\mathcal{O}(10)$ with respect to DNS and in a system of size $L_x\times
L_z=36\times 27$ at Reynolds number $R=377$ with an acceleration by a factor $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$.
The AMS results are validated with a comparison to DNS in the system of size $L_x\times L_z=24\times
18$. Visualisations in both systems indicate that turbulence collapses because the self sustaining
process of turbulence fails locally. The streamwise vortices decay first in streamwise elongated
holes, leaving streamwise invariant streamwise velocity tubes that experience viscous decay.
These holes then extend in the spanwise direction. The examination of more than a thousand of trajectories
in the $(E_{c,x}=\int u_x^2/2\,{\rm d}^3\mathbf{x},E_{c,y-z}=\int (u_y^2/2+u_z^2/2)\,{\rm
d}^3\mathbf{x})$ plane in the system of size $L_x\times L_z=24\times 18$ confirms the faster decay
of streamwise vortices and shows concentration of trajectory. This hints at an instanton phenomenology
in the large size limit. The computation of turning point states, beyond which laminarisation is
certain, confirms the hole formation scenario and shows that it is more pronounced in larger systems.
Finally, the examination of non reactive trajectories, where a hole opens then closes, indicates
that hole opening and closing are distinct processes. Both the vortices and the streaks reform concomitantly
when the laminar holes close.

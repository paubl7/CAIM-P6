As part of University College Dublin's MSc in Space Science & Technology curriculum, student teams,
over the course of a single term, design, build, launch (on a meteorological balloon), operate and
recover their own payload on a standardised platform. Each 'TupperSat' must be built from, or contained
within, a household plastic storage container, It must weigh less than 1kg, be able to determine
location, altitude, internal and external temperature and air pressure, and be able to broadcast
this information using an in-house communications system. Students must also design and build
a scientific payload or novel technology demonstration to fly on their TupperSat. Notable examples
include an earth observation vegetation sensor, particle sample return, gamma-ray detector,
and air-bag landing system. The instructors play the role of customer and launch authority. The
students are provided with a number of standard components including a Raspberry Pi single-board
computer, a 5000 mAH battery, high-altitude-compatible GPS unit, temperature and pressure sensors
and, a small low-power radio transceiver module developed specifically for the course based on
the LoRa standard. Teams are given a budget of EUR 100 ($115) to purchase additional materials and
to build their payload. The students learn space industry practices by full immersion in a typical
space project development cycle. TupperSat design and payload concepts are pitched by the student
teams at a Preliminary Design Review; plans are well developed before a Critical Design Review,
and the team must pass a Flight Readiness Review before being granted permission to launch. Good
project management is crucial in order to meet deadlines and secure a launch at the end of the term.
As student participation has grown, the module has been modified to allow for more ambitious and
challenging projects which further motivates the students.

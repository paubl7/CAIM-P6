Intraoperative Gamma Probe (IPG) remains the current gold standard modality for sentinel lymph
node identification and tumor removal in cancer patients. However, even alongside the optical
dyes they do not meet with <5% false negative rates (FNR) requirement, a key metric suggested by the
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). We are aiming to reduce FNR by using time of flight
(TOF) PET detector technology in the limited angle geometry system by using only two detector buckets
in coincidence, where one small-area detector is placed above the patient and the other with larger
detection-area, placed just under the patient bed. For proof of concept, we used two Hamamatsu TOF
PET detector modules (C13500-4075YC-12) featuring 12x12 array of 4.2x4.2x20 mm3 LFS crystal pixels,
one-one coupled to silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels. Detector coincidence timing resolution
(CTR) measured 271 ps FWHM for the whole detector. We 3D printed lesion phantom containing spheres
with 2-10 mm in diameter, representing lymph nodes, and placed it inside a 10-liter warm background
water phantom. Experimental results show that with sub-minute data acquisition, 6 mm diameter
spheres can be identified in the image when a lesion phantom with 10:1 activity ratio to background
is used. Simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data, by resolving 6 mm diameters
lesions with 60 seconds acquisition time, in 25 cm deep background water phantom with 10:1 activity
ratio. The image quality improves as the CTR improves in the simulation, and with decreasing background
water phantom depth or lesion to background activity ratio, in the experiment. With the results
presented here we conclude that limited angle TOF PET detector is a major step forward for intraoperative
applications in that, improved lesion detectability is beyond what the conventional Gamma- and
NIR-based probes could achieve.

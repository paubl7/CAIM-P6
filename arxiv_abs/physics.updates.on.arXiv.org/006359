The eventual exploitation of one-dimensional nanomaterials yet needs the development of scalable,
high yield, homogeneous, and environmentally friendly methods able to meet the requirements for
the fabrication of under design functional nanomaterials. In this article, we demonstrate a vacuum
and plasma one-reactor approach for the synthesis of the fundamental common element in solar energy
and optoelectronics, i.e. the transparent conducting electrode but in the form of nanotubes and
nanotrees architectures. Although the process is generic and can be used for a variety of TCOs and
wide-bandgap semiconductors, we focus herein on Indium Doped Tin Oxide (ITO) as the most extended
in the previous applications. This protocol combines widely applied deposition techniques such
as thermal evaporation for the formation of organic nanowires serving as 1D and 3D soft templates,
deposition of polycrystalline layers by magnetron sputtering, and removal of the template by simply
annealing under mild vacuum conditions. The process variables are tuned to control the stoichiometry,
morphology, and alignment of the ITO nanotubes and nanotrees. Four-probe characterization reveals
the improved lateral connectivity of the ITO nanotrees and applied on individual nanotubes shows
resistivities as low as 3.5 +/- 0.9 x 10-4 {\Omega}.cm, a value comparable to single-crystalline
counterparts. The assessment of diffuse reflectance and transmittance in the UV-VIS range confirms
the viability of the supported ITO nanotubes as a random optical media working as strong scattering
layers. Further ability to form ITO nanotrees opens the path for practical applications as ultra-broadband
absorbers in the NIR. The demonstrated low resistivity and optical properties of these ITO nanostructures
open the way for their use in LEDs, IR shield, energy harvesting, nanosensors, and photoelectrochemical
applications

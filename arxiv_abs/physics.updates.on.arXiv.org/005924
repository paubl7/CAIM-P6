The goal of this manuscript is to estimate Type B uncertainties in absorbed-dose calculations arising
from the different implementations in current state-of-the-art Monte Carlo codes of low-energy
photon cross-sections (<200 keV). Monte Carlo simulations are carried out using three codes widely
used in the low-energy domain: PENELOPE-2018, EGSnrc, and MCNP. Mass energy-absorption coefficients
for water, air, graphite, and their respective ratios; absorbed dose; and photon-fluence spectra
are considered. Benchmark simulations using similar cross-sections have been performed. The
differences observed between these quantities when different cross-sections are considered
are taken to be a good estimator for the corresponding Type B uncertainties. A conservative Type
B uncertainty for the absorbed dose (k=2) of 1.2%-1.7% (<50 keV), 0.6%-1.2% (50-100 keV), and 0.3%
(100-200 keV) is estimated. The photon-fluence spectrum does not present clinically relevant
differences that merit considering additional Type B uncertainties except for energies below
25 keV, where a Type B uncertainty of 0.5% is obtained. Below 30 keV, mass energy-absorption coefficients
show Type B uncertainties (k=2) of about 1.5% (water and air), and 2% (graphite), reaching values
about 1% (40-50 keV) and 0.5% (50-75 keV). Type B uncertainties for the water-to-graphite ratios
are observed for energies below 30 keV, about 0.7% (k=2). In contrast with the intermediate (about
500 keV) or high (about 1 MeV) energy domains, Type B uncertainties due to the different cross-sections
implementation cannot be considered subdominant with respect to Type A uncertainties or even to
other sources of Type B uncertainties. Therefore, the values reported here should be accommodated
within the uncertainty budget in low-energy photon dosimetry studies.

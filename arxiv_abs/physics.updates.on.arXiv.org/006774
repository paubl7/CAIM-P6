Cauchy-elastic solids include hyper-elasticity and a subset of elastic materials for which the
stress does not follow from a scalar strain potential. More in general, hypo-elastic materials
are only defined incrementally and comprise Cauchy-elasticity. Infringement of the hyperelastic
'dogma' is so far unattempted and normally believed to be impossible, as it apparently violates
thermodynamics, because energy may be produced in closed strain cycles. Contrary to this belief,
we show that non-hyper-elastic behavior is possible and we indicate the way to a practical realization
of this new concept. In particular, a design paradigm is established for artificial materials where
follower forces, so far ignored in homogenization schemes, are introduced as loads prestressing
an elastic two-dimensional grid made up of linear elastic rods (reacting to elongation, flexure
and shear). A rigorous application of Floquet-Bloch wave asymptotics yields an unsymmetric acoustic
tensor governing the incremental dynamics of the effective material. The latter is therefore the
incremental response of a hypo-elastic solid, which does not follow from a strain potential and
thus does not belong to hyper-elasticity. Through the externally applied follower forces (which
could be originated via interaction with a fluid, or gas, or by application of Coulomb friction,
or non-holonomic constraints), the artificial material may adsorb/release energy from/to the
environment, and therefore produce energy in a closed strain loop, without violating any rule of
thermodynamics. The solid is also shown to display flutter, a material instability corresponding
to a Hopf bifurcation, which was advocated as possible in plastic solids, but never experimentally
found and so far believed to be impossible in elasticity.

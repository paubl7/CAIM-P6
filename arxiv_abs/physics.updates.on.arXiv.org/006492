Traumatic brain injury can be caused by head impacts, but many brain injury risk estimation models
are less accurate across the variety of impacts that patients may undergo. We investigated the spectral
characteristics of different head impact types with kinematics classification. Data was analyzed
from 3,262 head impacts from lab reconstruction, American football, mixed martial arts, and publicly
available car crash data. A random forest classifier with spectral densities of linear acceleration
and angular velocity was built to classify head impact types (e.g., football), reaching a median
accuracy of 96% over 1,000 random partitions of training and test sets. To test the classifier on
data from different measurement devices, another 271 lab-reconstructed impacts were obtained
from 5 other instrumented mouthguards with the classifier reaching over 96% accuracy. The most
important features in the classification included both low-frequency and high-frequency features,
both linear acceleration features and angular velocity features. Different head impact types
had different distributions of spectral densities in low-frequency and high-frequency ranges
(e.g., the spectral densities of MMA impacts were higher in high-frequency range than in the low-frequency
range). Finally, with the classifier, type-specific, nearest-neighbor regression models were
built for 95th percentile maximum principal strain, 95th percentile maximum principal strain
in corpus callosum, and cumulative strain damage (15th percentile). This showed a generally higher
R2-value than baseline models. The classifier enables a better understanding of the impact kinematics
in different sports, and it can be applied to evaluate the quality of impact-simulation systems
and on-field data augmentation. Key words: traumatic brain injury, head impacts, classification,

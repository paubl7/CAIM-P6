In the last decades, Bulk-Acoustic-Wave (BAW) filters have been essential components of 1G-to-4G
radios. These devices rely on the high electromechanical coupling coefficient (kt2~7%), attained
by Aluminum Nitride (AlN) Film-Bulk-Acoustic-Resonators (FBARs), to achieve a wideband and low-loss
frequency response. As the resonance frequency of FBARs is set by their thickness, the integration
of multiple FBARs, to form filters, can only be attained through the adoption of frequency tuning
fabrication steps, such as mass loading or trimming. However, as the ability to reliably control
these steps significantly decays for thinner FBARs, manufacturing FBARs-based filters, addressing
the needs of emerging IoT and 5G high-frequency applications, is becoming more and more challenging.
Consequently, there is a quest for new acoustic resonant components, simultaneously exhibiting
high kt2 and a lithographic frequency tunability. In this work, a novel class of AlN resonators is
presented. These radio-frequency devices, labelled as Two-Dimensional-Resonant-Rods (2DRRs),
exploit, for the first time, the unconventional acoustic behavior exhibited by a forest of locally
resonant rods, built in the body of a profiled AlN layer that is sandwiched between a bottom un-patterned
metal plate and a top metallic grating. 2DRRs exhibit unexplored modal features that make them able
to achieve high kt2, a significant lithographic frequency tunability and a relaxed lithographic
resolution, while relying on an optimal AlN crystalline orientation. The operation of 2DRRs is
discussed, in this work, by means of analytical and finite-element (FE) investigations. The measured
performance of the first fabricated 2DRR, showing a kt2 in excess of 7.4%, are also reported.

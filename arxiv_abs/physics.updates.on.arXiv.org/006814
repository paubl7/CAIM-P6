Numerical modeling simulations and the use of high-performance computing are fundamental for
detailed safety analysis, control and operation of a nuclear reactor, allowing the study and analysis
of problems related to thermal-hydraulics, neutronic, and the dynamic of fluids that are involved
in these systems. In this work, we introduce the basis for the implementation of the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) approach to analyze heat transfer in a nuclear reactor core. Heat transfer
by means of convection is of great importance in many engineering applications and especially in
the analysis of heat transfer in nuclear reactors. As a first approach, the natural convection in
the gap (space that exists between the fuel rod and the cladding) can be analyzed helping to reduce
uncertainty in such calculations that usually relies on empirical correlations while using other
numerical tools. The numerical method developed in this work was validated while comparing the
results obtained in previous numerical simulations and experimental data reported in the literature
showing that our implementation is suitable for the study of heat transfer in nuclear reactors.
Numerical simulations were done with the DualSPHysics open source code that allows performing
parallel calculations using different numbers of cores. The current implementation is a version
written in CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) that allows also the use of GPU processors
(Graphics Processor Unit) to accelerate the calculations in parallel using a large number of cores
contained in the GPU. This makes it possible to analyze large systems using a reasonable computer
time. The obtained results verified and validated our method and allowed us to have a strong solver
for future applications of heat transfer in nuclear reactors fuel inside the reactor cores.

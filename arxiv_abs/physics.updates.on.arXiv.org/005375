This paper clarifies the theoretical basis for constructing spiciness variables optimal for characterising
ocean water masses. Three essential ingredients are identified: 1) a material density variable
$\gamma$ that is as neutral as feasible; 2) a material state function $\xi$ independent of $\gamma$,
but otherwise arbitrary; 3) an empirically determined reference function $\xi_r(\gamma)$ of
$\gamma$ representing the imagined behaviour of $\xi$ in a notional spiceless ocean. Ingredient
1) is required because contrary to what is often assumed, it is not the properties imposed on $\xi$
(such as orthogonality) that determine its dynamical inertness but the degree of neutrality of
$\gamma$. The first key result is that it is the anomaly $\xi' = \xi - \xi_r(\gamma)$, rather than
$\xi$, that is the variable the most suited for characterising ocean water masses, as originally
proposed by McDougall and Giles (1987). The second key result is that oceanic sections of normalised
$\xi'$ appear to be relatively insensitive to the choice of $\xi$, as first suggested by Jackett
and McDougall (1985). It is also argued that orthogonality of $\nabla \xi'$ to $\nabla \gamma$ in
physical space is more germane to spiciness theory than orthogonality in thermohaline space, although
how to use it to constrain the choices of $\xi$ and $\xi_r(\gamma)$ remains to be fully elucidated.
The results are important for they unify the various ways in which spiciness has been defined and
used in the literature. They also provide a rigorous theoretical basis justifying the pursuit of
a globally defined material density variable maximising neutrality. To illustrate the latter
point, this paper proposes a new implementation of the author's recently developed thermodynamic
neutral density and explains how to adapt existing definitions of spiciness/spicity to work with
it.

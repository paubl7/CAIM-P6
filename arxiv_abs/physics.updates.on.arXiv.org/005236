This is an investigation into the exact forms of images of point charges in conducting prolate spheroids.
For a point source close the surface of a spheroid, the standard series solutions for the potential
diverge in a region that encompasses the singularities - or equivalently the images - of the reflected
potential inside the spheroid. Current image formulations in the literature consist of image point
and line charges, but these are also encompassed by a spheroid of surface charge. In theory an image
can always be found that does not require a closed surface charge; a more compact, reduced image system
lies inside that matches the singularity of the analytic continuation of the potential. We demonstrate
this for a point charge on the axis of a prolate spheroid, uncovering the location and nature of the
images by using different series expansions which converge in all space except the singularity
of the potential. For an off axis charge we find a new approximate image charge. The image is found
to lie on a line segment that includes the focal segment and extends somewhat further up the axis.
For a point charge at the center of the spheroid, the image singularity is found to lie on an infinitely
wide, flat sheet with a hole around the spheroid. For a point charge located anywhere inside the spheroid,
we find two new approximate image charge solutions, one is a point charge in real space which applies
when source lies near the surface, and the other is a point charge in complex space which projects
as a ring in the real space, and applies when the source lies near the rotation axis. When the point
charge lies exactly on a focal point, we find that a multipole of order 1/2 is an ideal image approximation.

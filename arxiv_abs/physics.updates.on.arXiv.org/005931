Recent works have explored the potential of machine learning as data-driven turbulence closures
for RANS and LES techniques. Beyond these advances, the high expressivity and agility of physics-informed
neural networks (PINNs) make them promising candidates for full fluid flow PDE modeling. An important
question is whether this new paradigm, exempt from the traditional notion of discretization of
the underlying operators very much connected to the flow scales resolution, is capable of sustaining
high levels of turbulence characterized by multi-scale features? We investigate the use of PINNs
surrogate modeling for turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard (RB) convection flows in rough and smooth
rectangular cavities, mainly relying on DNS temperature data from the fluid bulk. We carefully
quantify the computational requirements under which the formulation is capable of accurately
recovering the flow hidden quantities. We then propose a new padding technique to distribute some
of the scattered coordinates-at which PDE residuals are minimized-around the region of labeled
data acquisition. We show how it comes to play as a regularization close to the training boundaries
which are zones of poor accuracy for standard PINNs and results in a noticeable global accuracy improvement
at iso-budget. Finally, we propose for the first time to relax the incompressibility condition
in such a way that it drastically benefits the optimization search and results in a much improved
convergence of the composite loss function. The RB results obtained at high Rayleigh number Ra =
2 $\bullet$ 10 9 are particularly impressive: the predictive accuracy of the surrogate over the
entire half a billion DNS coordinates yields errors for all flow variables ranging between [0.3%
-- 4%] in the relative L 2 norm, with a training relying only on 1.6% of the DNS data points.

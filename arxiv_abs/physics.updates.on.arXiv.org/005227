We present an asymptotic theory for analytical characterization of the high-Reynolds-number
incompressible flow of a Newtonian fluid past a shear-free circular cylinder. The viscosity-induced
modifications to this flow are localized and except in the neighborhood of the rear stagnation point,
behave like a linear perturbation of the inviscid flow. Our theory gives a highly accurate description
of these modifications by including the contribution from the most significant viscous term in
a correctional perturbation expansion about an inviscid base state. We derive the boundary layer
equation for the flow and deduce a similarity transformation that leads to a set of infinite, shear-free-condition-incompatible,
self-similar solutions. By suitably combining members from this set, we construct an all-boundary-condition-compatible
solution to the boundary layer equation. We derive the governing equation for vorticity transport
through the narrow wake region and determine its closed-form solution. The near and far field forms
of our wake solution are desirably consistent with the boundary layer solution and the well-known,
self-similar planar wake solution, respectively. We analyze the flow in the rear stagnation region
by formulating an elliptic partial integro-differential equation for the distortion streamfunction
that specifically accounts for the fully nonlinear and inviscid dynamics of the viscous correctional
terms. The drag force and its atypical logarithmic dependence on Reynolds number, deduced from
our matched asymptotic analysis, are in remarkable agreement with the high-resolution simulation
results. The logarithmic dependence gives rise to a critical Reynolds number below which the viscous
correction term, counterintuitively, reduces the net dissipation in the flow field.

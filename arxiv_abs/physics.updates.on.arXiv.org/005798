On 15 May 2020 an MWW 6.5 earthquake occurred beneath the Monte Cristo Range in the Mina Deflection
region of western Nevada. Rapid deployment of eight temporary seismic stations enables detailed
analysis of its productive and slowly decaying aftershock sequence (p=0.8) which included ~18,000
autodetected events in 3.5 months. Double-difference, waveform-based relative relocation of
16,714 earthquakes reveals a complex network of faults, many of which cross the inferred 35-km long
east-northeast-striking, left-lateral mainshock rupture. Seismicity aligns with left-lateral,
right-lateral, and normal mechanism moment tensors of 128 of the largest earthquakes. The mainshock
occurred near the middle of the aftershock zone at the intersection of two distinct zones of seismicity.
In the western section, numerous subparallel, shallow, north-northeast-striking faults form
a broad flower-structure-like fault mesh that coalesces at depth into a near-vertical, left-lateral
fault. We infer the near-vertical fault to be a region of significant slip in the mainshock and an
eastward extension of the left-lateral Candelaria fault. Near the mainshock hypocenter, seismicity
occurs on a northeast-striking, west-dipping structure which extends north from the Eastern Columbus
Salt Marsh normal fault. Together, these two intersecting structures bound the Columbus Salt Marsh
tectonic basin. East of this intersection and the mainshock hypocenter, seismicity occurs in a
narrow, near-vertical, east-northeast-striking fault zone through to its eastern terminus.
At the eastern end, the aftershock zone broadens and extends northwest towards the southern extension
of the northwest-striking, right-lateral Petrified Springs fault system. The eastern section
hosts significantly fewer aftershocks than the western section, but has more moment release.

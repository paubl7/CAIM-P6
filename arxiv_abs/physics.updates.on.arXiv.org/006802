Metachronal swimming, the sequential beating of limbs with a small phase lag, is observed in many
organisms at various scales, but has been studied mostly in the limits of high or low Reynolds numbers.
Motivated by the swimming of brine shrimp, a mesoscale organism that operates at intermediate Reynolds
numbers, we computationally studied a simple nonreciprocal 2D model that performs metachronal
swimming. Our swimmer is composed of two pairs of paddles beating with a phase difference that are
symmetrically attached to the sides of a flat body. We numerically solved the Navier-Stokes equations
and used the immersed boundary method to model the interactions between the fluid and swimmer. To
investigate the effect of inertia and geometry, we performed simulations varying the paddle spacing
and the Reynolds numbers in the range $Re = 0.05 - 100$. In all cases, we observed back-and-forth motion
during the cycle and a finite cycle-averaged swim speed at steady state. Interestingly, we found
that the swim speed of the swimmer has nonmonotonic dependence on $Re$, with a maximum around $Re\approx1$,
a flat minimum between $Re=20-30$ and an eventual increase for $Re>35$. To get more insight into
the mechanism behind this relationship, we first decomposed the swim stroke of the swimmer and each
paddle into power and recovery strokes and characterized the forward and backward motion. Unlike
for reciprocal swimmers, here, for parts of the cycle there is competition between the two strokes
of the paddles - the balance of which leads to net motion. We then studied the cycle-averaged, as well
as, power-stroke-averaged and recovery-stroke-averaged fluid flows, and related differences
in the fluid field to the nonmonotonic behavior of the swim speed. Our results suggest the existence
of distinct motility mechanisms that develop as inertia increases within the intermediate-Re
range.

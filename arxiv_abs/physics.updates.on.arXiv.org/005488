Compliance of member States to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is monitored
through nuclear safeguards. The Passive Gamma Emission Tomography system is a novel instrument
developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the verification of spent nuclear
fuel stored in water pools. Advanced image reconstruction techniques are crucial for obtaining
high-quality cross-sectional images of the spent-fuel bundle to allow inspectors of the IAEA to
monitor nuclear material and promptly identify its diversion. In this work, we have developed a
software suite to accurately reconstruct the spent-fuel cross sectional image, automatically
identify present fuel rods, and estimate their activity. Unique image reconstruction challenges
are posed by the measurement of spent fuel, due to its high activity and the self-attenuation. We
implemented a linear forward model to model the detector responses to the fuel rods inside the PGET.
The image reconstruction is performed by solving a regularized linear inverse problem using the
fast-iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm. We have also implemented the traditional
filtered back projection method for comparison and applied both methods to reconstruct images
of simulated mockup fuel assemblies. Higher image resolution and fewer reconstruction artifacts
were obtained with the inverse-problem approach, with the mean-square-error reduced by 50%, and
the structural-similarity improved by 200%. We then used a convolutional neural network to automatically
identify the bundle type and extract the pin locations from the images; the estimated activity levels
finally being compared with the ground truth. The proposed computational methods accurately estimated
the activity levels of the present pins, with an associated uncertainty of approximately 5%.

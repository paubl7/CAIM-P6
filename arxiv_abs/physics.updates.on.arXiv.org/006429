The spread of an infection, a contagion, meme, emotion, message and various other spreadable objects
have been discussed in several works. Burning and firefighting have been discussed in particular
on static graphs. Graph burning simulates the notion of the spread of "fire" throughout a graph (plus,
one unburned node burned at each time-step); graph firefighting simulates the defending of nodes
by placing firefighters on the nodes which have not been already burned while the fire is being spread
(started by only a single fire source). This article studies a combination of firefighting and burning
on a graph class which is a variation (generalization) of temporal graphs. Nodes can be infected
from "outside" a network. We present a notion of both upgrading (of unburned nodes, similar to firefighting)
and repairing (of infected nodes). The nodes which are burned, firefighted, or repaired are chosen
probabilistically. So a variable amount of nodes are allowed to be infected, upgraded and repaired
in each time step. In the model presented in this article, both burning and firefighting proceed
concurrently, we introduce such a system to enable the community to study the notion of spread of
an infection and the notion of upgrade/repair against each other. The graph class that we study (on
which, these processes are simulated) is a variation of temporal graph class in which at each time-step,
probabilistically, a communication takes place (iff an edge exists in that time step). In addition,
a node can be "worn out" and thus can be removed from the network, and a new healthy node can be added
to the network as well. This class of graphs enables systems with high complexity to be able to be simulated
and studied.

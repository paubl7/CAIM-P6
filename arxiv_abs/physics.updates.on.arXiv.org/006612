Reconstruction of the mandible is one of the most common challenges facing maxillofacial surgeons.
The mandible plays a major role in supporting the teeth inside the mouth. This work aims to develop
a proposed methodology for improving reconstructive surgery by using the simulation of a mandibular
defect using imaging, design, and fabrication techniques for a custom mandible. The combination
of these technologies provides a powerful way to improve and implement the implant process through
the design and fabrication of medical models. This work introduces a methodology that the capabilities
of Reverse Engineering (RE), Computer-Aided Design (CAD), and Rapid Prototyping Technology (RP)
for the reconstruction of the mandible and representing the surgery. Patient examination using
a high-resolution technique represented by Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), after which
a representative digital model of the patient is created to assist in the design process using the
3DSlicer software The patient's implant designed (Defect part) and analyzed using Solidwork.3D
models are assembled and implant simulations are performed by (Meshmixer) software, Stereolithography
technology (SLA) used as 3D printing technology to fabricate the mandible model the resin. The results
of this work show that procedures for mandible reconstruction can be successfully used using the
integration of RE / CAD / RP technologies. This integration will support the acceptable symmetry
of the face that will be restored by assisting surgeons in planning reconstruction. This work demonstrates
the importance of the CAD system in resolving patient damage requirements directly from medical
imaging data, as well as the efficiency of RP techniques used in converting 3D model designs into
implant models.

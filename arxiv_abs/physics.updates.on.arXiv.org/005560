The effects of El Ni\~no's two distinct flavors, East Pacific (EP) and Central Pacific (CP)/Modoki
El Ni\~no, on global climate variability have been studied intensively in recent years. Most of
these studies have made use of linear multivariate statistics or composite analysis. Especially
the former assumes the same type of linear statistical dependency to apply across different phases
of the El Ni\~no--Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which appears not necessarily a justified assumption.
Here, we statistically evaluate the likelihood of co-occurrences between very high or very low
seasonal precipitation sums over vast parts of the global land surface and the presence of the respective
EP and CP types of both, El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na. By employing event coincidence analysis, we uncover
differential imprints of both flavors on very low and very high seasonal precipitation patterns
over distinct regions across the globe, which may severely affect, among others, agricultural
and biomass production or public health. We particularly find that EP periods exhibit statistically
significant event coincidence rates with hydrometeorological anomalies at larger spatial scales,
whereas sparser patterns emerge along with CP periods. Our statistical analysis confirms previously
reported interrelations for EP periods and uncovers additional distinct regional patterns of
very high/low seasonal precipitation, such as increased rainfall over Central Asia alongside
CP periods that have to our knowledge not been reported so far. Our results demonstrate that a thorough
distinction of El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na into their two respective flavors could be crucial for understanding
the emergence of strong regional hydrometeorological anomalies and anticipating their associated
ecological and socioeconomic impacts.

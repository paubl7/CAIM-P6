In this study, noise generation is investigated for a generic voluteless centrifugal HVAC fan at
an off-design operation point where tonal noise increases. The simulations are performed by coupling
IDDES with the FW-H acoustic analogy, and the experiments are conducted in a rig consisting of a plenum
chamber and a reverberation room. In contrast to typical tonal noise sources induced by the fan blades,
we find out that another predominant source is the turbulence stemming from the gap between the fan
shroud and the inlet duct. The turbulence evolves along with the shroud and is swept downstream to
interact with the top side of the blade leading edge. The interaction accounts for uneven surface
pressure distribution on the blades. Moreover, the pressure is significantly unsteady near the
shroud. The power spectral density (PSD) of the noise shows obvious tones at 273Hz that is approximately
equal to the difference of the blade passing frequency (BPF0) and the fan rotation frequency. By
coarsening the mesh resolution near the inlet gap and shroud, we artificially deactivate the gap
turbulence in the numerical simulations and, consequently, detect that the tone at 273Hz disappears
completely. At this frequency, the PSD contours of surface pressure fluctuations are found potent
at the inlet gap and the blade top side only if the gap turbulence is resolved. These findings indicate
that the tonal noise source at 273Hz is the interaction between the gap turbulence and blades. As
the gap turbulence exists near the shroud wall upstream of the blades, the rotating wall introduces
rotational momentum into the turbulence due to the wall friction. Hence the tonal frequency of the
interaction is smaller than BPF0 with a decrement of the fan rotation frequency. To the authors'
knowledge, it is the first time that voluteless centrifugal fans are studied for the noise generation
from the gap turbulence.

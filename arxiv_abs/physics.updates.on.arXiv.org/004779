Vibrational-electronic (vibronic) resonance and its role in energy and charge transfer has been
experimentally and theoretically investigated in several photosynthetic proteins. Using a dimer
modeled on a typical photosynthetic protein, we contrast the description of such excitons provided
by an exact basis set description, as opposed to a basis set with reduced vibrational dimensionality.
Using a reduced analytical description of the full Hamiltonian, we show that in the presence of vibrational
excitation both on electronically excited as well as unexcited sites, constructive interference
between such basis states causes vibronic coupling between excitons to become progressively stronger
with increasing quanta of vibrational excitation. This effect leads to three distinguishing features
of excitons coupled through a vibronic resonance which are not captured in basis sets with reduced
vibrational dimensionality - 1. the vibronic resonance criterion itself, 2. vibronically assisted
perfect delocalization between sites even though purely electronic mixing between the sites is
imperfect due to energetic disorder, 3. the nuclear distortion accompanying vibronic excitons
becoming increasingly larger for resonant vibronic coupling involving higher vibrational quanta.
In terms of spectroscopically observable limitations of reduced basis set descriptions of vibronic
resonance, several differences are seen in absorption and emission spectra, but may be obscured
on account of overwhelming line broadening. However, we show that several features such as vibronic
exciton delocalization and vibrational distortions associated with electronic excitations,
which ultimately dictate the excited state wavepacket motions and relaxation processes, are fundamentally
not described under reduced basis set descriptions of vibronic resonance.

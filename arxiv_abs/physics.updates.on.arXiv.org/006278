We present a comprehensive review of recent developments in the field of chiral plasmonics. Significant
advances have been made recently in understanding the working principles of chiral plasmonic structures.
With advances in micro- and nanofabrication techniques, a variety of chiral plasmonic nanostructures
have been experimentally realized; these tailored chiroptical properties vastly outperform
those of their molecular counterparts. We focus on chiral plasmonic nanostructures created using
bottom-up approaches, which not only allow for rational design and fabrication but most intriguingly
in many cases also enable dynamic manipulation and tuning of chiroptical responses. We first discuss
plasmon-induced chirality, resulting from the interaction of chiral molecules with plasmonic
excitations. Subsequently, we discuss intrinsically chiral colloids, which give rise to optical
chirality owing to their chiral shapes. Finally, we discuss plasmonic chirality, achieved by arranging
achiral plasmonic particles into handed configurations on static or active templates. Chiral
plasmonic nanostructures are very promising candidates for real-life applications owing to their
significantly larger optical chirality than natural molecules. In addition, chiral plasmonic
nanostructures offer engineerable and dynamic chiroptical responses, which are formidable to
achieve in molecular systems. We thus anticipate that the field of chiral plasmonics will attract
further widespread attention in applications ranging from enantioselective analysis to chiral
sensing, structural determination, and in situ ultrasensitive detection of multiple disease
biomarkers, as well as optical monitoring of transmembrane transport and intracellular metabolism.

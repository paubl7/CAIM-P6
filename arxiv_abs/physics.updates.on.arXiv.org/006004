The emission properties of tin plasmas, produced by the irradiation of preformed liquid tin targets
by several-ns-long 2-$\mu$m-wavelength laser pulses, are studied in the extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) regime. In a two-pulse scheme, a pre-pulse laser is first used to deform tin microdroplets
into thin, extended disks before the main (2$\mu$m) pulse creates the EUV-emitting plasma. Irradiating
30- to 300-$\mu$m-diameter targets with 2-$\mu$m laser pulses, we find that the efficiency in creating
EUV light around 13.5nm follows the fraction of laser light that overlaps with the target. Next,
the effects of a change in 2-$\mu$m drive laser intensity (0.6-1.8$\times 10^{11}$W/cm$^2$) and
pulse duration (3.7-7.4ns) are studied. It is found that the angular dependence of the emission
of light within a 2\% bandwidth around 13.5nm and within the backward 2$\pi$ hemisphere around the
incoming laser beam is almost independent of intensity and duration of the 2-$\mu$m drive laser.
With increasing target diameter, the emission in this 2\% bandwidth becomes increasingly anisotropic,
with a greater fraction of light being emitted into the hemisphere of the incoming laser beam. For
direct comparison, a similar set of experiments is performed with a 1-$\mu$m-wavelength drive
laser. Emission spectra, recorded in a 5.5-25.5nm wavelength range, show significant self-absorption
of light around 13.5nm in the 1-$\mu$m case, while in the 2-$\mu$m case only an opacity-related broadening
of the spectral feature at 13.5nm is observed. This work demonstrates the enhanced capabilities
and performance of 2-$\mu$m-driven plasmas produced from disk targets when compared to 1-$\mu$m-driven
plasmas, providing strong motivation for the use of 2-$\mu$m lasers as drive lasers in future high-power
sources of EUV light.

We present a prognostic, one-equation model for eddy-mean flow interactions to parameterize the
divergence of the Eliassen-Palm flux tensor (EPFT) that arises from thickness-weighted averaging
(TWA) the hydrostatic Boussinesq equations. The TWA system of equations does not invoke approximations
beyond those for which the hydrostatic Boussinesq equations are valid, constituting a mathematically
consistent framework with clear physical interpretations. This model is intended for the adiabatic
interior of zonally symmetric flows, in the absence of topographic features, where terms corresponding
to eddy interfacial form drag in the EPFT dominate forces. We model eddy interfacial form drag terms
for vertical flux of horizontal momentum using the gradient hypothesis, as the product of an eddy
viscosity and the vertical gradient of horizontal momentum. We use mixing length theory to relate
viscosity to an eddy length scale and an eddy velocity, which is proportional to the eddy energy in
the TWA system. The eddy length scale is modeled as the first Rossby radius of deformation, which
we calculate as a function of the mean flow. We use a prognostic equation for vertically integrated
eddy energy at each horizontal location, which we derive from the TWA framework, and then simplify
to the flows of interest by ignoring transport, redistribution and diabatic terms. The prognostic
vertically integrated eddy energy is projected onto the water column using the eigenvalue of the
first baroclinic mode to obtain the eddy energy at each vertical position. The eddy viscosity has
horizontal as well as vertical structure. We diagnosed the model equations in an eddy resolving
numerical simulation of a zonally re-entrant channel representative of the Southern Ocean. We
have implemented the model parameterization in an ocean model and tested it to simulate a parameterized
simulation of this flow.

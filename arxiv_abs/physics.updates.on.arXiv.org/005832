This study creates a physiologically realistic virtual patient database (VPD), representing
the human arterial system, for the primary purpose of studying the affects of arterial disease on
haemodynamics. A low dimensional representation of an anatomically detailed arterial network
is outlined, and a physiologically realistic posterior distribution for its parameters is constructed
through a Bayesian approach. This approach combines both physiological/geometrical constraints
and the available measurements reported in the literature. A key contribution of this work is to
present a framework for including all such available information for the creation of virtual patients
(VPs). The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used to sample random VPs from this posterior
distribution, and the pressure and flow-rate profiles associated with the VPs are computed through
a model of pulse wave propagation. This combination of the arterial network parameters (representing
the VPs) and the haemodynamics waveforms of pressure and flow-rates at various locations (representing
functional response of the VPs) makes up the VPD. While 75,000 VPs are sampled from the posterior
distribution, 10,000 are discarded as the initial burn-in period. A further 12,857 VPs are subsequently
removed due to the presence of negative average flow-rate. Due to an undesirable behaviour observed
in some VPs -- asymmetric under- and over-damped pressure and flow-rate profiles in the left and
right sides of the arterial system -- a filter is proposed for their removal. The final VPD has 28,868
subjects. It is shown that the methodology is appropriate by comparing the VPD statistics to those
reported in literature across real populations. A good agreement between the two is found while
respecting physiological/geometrical constraints. The pre-filter database is made available

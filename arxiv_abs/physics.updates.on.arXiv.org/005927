Optical prisms are made of glass and map temporal frequencies into spatial frequencies by decomposing
incident white light into its constituent colors and refract them into different directions. Conventional
prisms suffer from their volumetric bulky and heavy structure and their material parameters are
dictated by the Lorentz reciprocity theorem. Considering various applications of prisms in wave
engineering and their growing applications in the invisible spectrum and antenna applications,
there is a demand for compact apparatuses that are capable of providing prism functionality in a
reconfigurable manner, with a nonreciprocal/reciprocal response. Here, we propose a nonreciprocal
metasurface-based prism constituted of an array of phase- and amplitude-gradient frequency-dependent
spatially variant radiating super-cells. In conventional optical prisms, nonreciprocal devices
and metamaterials, the spatial decomposition and nonreciprocity functions are fixed and noneditable.
Here, we present a programmable metasurface integrated with amplifiers to realize controllable
nonreciprocal spatial decomposition, where each frequency component of the incident polychromatic
wave can be transmitted under an arbitrary and programmable angle of transmission with a desired
transmission gain. Such a polychromatic metasurface prism is constituted of frequency-dependent
spatially variant transistor-based phase shifters and amplifiers for the spatial decomposition
of the wave components. Interesting features include three-dimensional prism functionality
with programmable angles of refraction, power amplification, and directive and diverse radiation
beams. Furthermore, the metasurface prism can be digitally controlled via a field-programmable
gate array (FPGA), making the metasurface a suitable solution for radars, holography applications,
and wireless telecommunication systems.

In this study, we tested the robustness of three communication networks extracted from the online
forums included in the intranet platforms of three large companies. For each company we analyzed
the communication among employees both in terms of network structure and content (language used).
Over a period of eight months, we analyzed more than 52,000 messages posted by approximately 12,000
employees. Specifically, we tested the network robustness and the stability of a set of structural
and semantic metrics, while applying several different node removal strategies. We removed the
forum moderators, the spammers, the overly connected nodes and the nodes lying at the network periphery,
also testing different combinations of these selections. Results indicate that removing spammers
and very peripheral nodes can be a relatively low impact strategy in this context; accordingly,
it could be used to clean the noise generated by these types of social actor and to reduce the computation
complexity of the analysis. On the other hand, the removal of moderators seems to have a significant
impact on the network connectivity and the shared content. The most affected variables are closeness
centrality and contribution index. We also found that the removal of overly connected nodes can
significantly change the network structure. Lastly, we compared the behavior of moderators with
the other users, finding distinctive characteristics by which moderators can be identified when
their list is unknown. Our findings can help online community managers to understand the role of
moderators within intranet forums and can be useful for social network analysts who are interested
in evaluating the effects of graph simplification techniques.

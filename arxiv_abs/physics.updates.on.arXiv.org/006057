Integrated photonics has enabled signal synthesis, modulation and conversion using photonic
integrated circuits (PIC). Many materials have been developed, among which silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$)
has emerged as a leading platform particularly for nonlinear photonics. Low-loss Si$_3$N$_4$
PIC has been widely used for frequency comb generation, narrow-linewidth lasers, microwave photonics,
photonic computing networks, and even surface-electrode ion traps. Yet, among all demonstrated
functionalities for Si$_3$N$_4$ integrated photonics, optical non-reciprocal devices, such
as isolators and circulators, have not been achieved. Conventionally, they are realized based
on Faraday effect of magneto-optic materials under external magnetic field. However, it has been
challenging to integrate magneto-optic materials that are not CMOS-compatible and that require
bulky external magnet. Here, we demonstrate a magnetic-free optical isolator based on aluminum
nitride (AlN) piezoelectric modulators monolithically integrated on ultralow-loss Si$_3$N$_4$
PIC. The transmission reciprocity is broken by spatio-temporal modulation of a Si$_3$N$_4$ microring
resonator with three AlN bulk acoustic wave resonators that are driven with a rotational phase.
This design creates an effective rotating acoustic wave that allows indirect interband transition
in only one direction among a pair of strongly coupled optical modes. Maximum of 10 dB isolation is
achieved under 100 mW RF power applied to each actuator, with minimum insertion loss of 0.1 dB. The
isolation remains constant over nearly 30 dB dynamic range of optical input power, showing excellent
optical linearity. Our integrated, linear, magnetic-free, electrically driven optical isolator
could become key building blocks for integrated lasers, chip-scale LiDAR engines, as well as optical
interfaces for superconducting circuits.

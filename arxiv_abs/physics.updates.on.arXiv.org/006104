Vaccination may be the solution to the pandemic-induced health crisis, but the allocation of vaccines
is a complex task in which economic and social considerations can be important. The central problem
is to use the limited number of vaccines in a country to reduce the risk of infection and mitigate economic
uncertainty at the same time. In this paper, we propose a simple economic model for vaccine allocation
across two types of workers: white-collars can work from home; while blue-collars must work on site.
These worker types are complementary to each other, thus a negative shock to the supply of either
one decreases the demand for the other that leads to unemployment. Using parameters of blue and white-collar
labor supply, their infection risks, productivity losses at home office during lock-down, and
available vaccines, we express the optimal share of vaccines allocated to blue-collars. The model
points to the dominance of blue-collar vaccination, especially during waves when their relative
infection risks increase and when the number of available vaccines is limited. Taking labor supply
data from 28 European countries, we quantify blue-collar vaccine allocation that minimizes unemployment
across levels of blue- and white-collar infection risks. The model favours blue-collar vaccination
identically across European countries in case of vaccine scarcity. As more vaccines become available,
economies that host large-shares of employees in home-office shall increasingly immunize them
in case blue-collar infection risks can be kept down. Our results highlight that vaccination plans
should include workers and rank them by type of occupation. We propose that prioritizing blue-collar
workers during infection waves and early vaccination can also favour economy besides helping the
most vulnerable who can transmit more infection.

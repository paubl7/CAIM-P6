Energy harvesting from shadow-effect is the generation of electrical power from a Schottky junction
when a part of it is kept in shadow and the remaining under illumination. It has been recently invented
in Au/n-Si junctions, where modulation of work function of the Au top electrode under contrasting
illumination has been invoked to explain the effect. In this paper, a different physical mechanism
for energy harvesting from shadow-effect in a Schottky junction is proposed that does not assume
change in work function of the top electrode under illumination. The device, termed shadow-effect
energy generator (SEG), is modelled as two parallel Schottky junction solar cells, one at the shadowed
and the other at the illuminated part, connected with each other in a closed loop circuit through
the Si substrate and the top electrode. To test the proposed mechanism, ITO/n-Si junction based
SEGs have been fabricated. The values of open circuit voltage in the SEGs have been found to be matching
with the difference of photovoltages of the two cells corrected for the potential drop across the
Si substrate, that validates the proposed mechanism. To further corroborate the mechanism, the
conventional SEG geometry has been modified by applying a continuous ohmic coating at the back of
the Si substrates that bypasses the resistance of the Si substrate for current flow and results in
higher open circuit voltage and short circuit current. Moreover, ITO/n-Si based SEGs have been
found to produce higher output power density compared to that reported in Au/n-Si devices in both
the conventional and the new geometry. Although the closed loop present in the equivalent circuit
of the SEG devices lead to wastage of harvested energy, the ITO/n-Si SEG devices can nevertheless
be used as self-powered sensor for light, object and movement detection as well as for producing
electricity from contrasting illumination.

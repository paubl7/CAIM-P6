We discuss the evolutionary enhancement of mutational robustness for a model of the gene regulatory
network (GRN). For exploring the particularity of evolution, we need a reference system. Such a
reference system that we consider appropriate is a set of randomly sampled GRNs. Recently, Nagata
and Kikuchi (PLoS Comput Biol 16 (2020) e1007969) proposed an efficient procedure for randomly
sampling GRNs in a wide range of fitness based on the multicanonical Monte Carlo method. We employ
that method to construct the reference set and compare it with the lineages obtained by evolutionary
simulations. We consider a neural-network-like model of GRN, which has one input gene and one output
gene. The fitness is defined so that it is large when the difference in the expressions of the output
gene between two input values ("on" and "off") becomes large. By comparing the evolution of fitness
and the fitness distribution of the reference set, we find that evolution slows down significantly
near the value of fitness that the number of GRNs becomes extremely rare. It implies that the evolutionary
speed is determined mainly by the number of available GRNs, or in other words, "entropy". Random
sampling reveals that the highly-fit GRNs in this model inevitably exhibit bistability. Accordingly,
the evolutionary simulations produce bistable GRNs as fitness becomes high. But the increase in
the fraction of bistable GRNs occurs at higher fitness than the reference set. Thus, the emergence
of a new phenotype, bistability, is delayed in evolution. We also study an indicator of mutational
robustness. While in the early stage of evolution, it coincides with that of the reference set, in
the late stage, it becomes significantly higher than that of the reference set. In short, evolution
enhances mutational robustness. The reason is that GRNs with fewer lethal edges are selected by
evolution.

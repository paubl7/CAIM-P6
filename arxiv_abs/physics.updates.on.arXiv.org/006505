Third-order approximate solutions for surface gravity waves in the finite water depth are studied
in the context of potential flow theory. This solution provides explicit expressions for the surface
elevation, free-surface velocity potential and velocity potential. The amplitude dispersion
relation is also provided. Two approaches are used to derive the third order analytical solution,
resulting in two types of approximate solutions: the perturbation solution and the Hamiltonian
solution. The perturbation solution is obtained by classical perturbation technique in which
the time variable is expanded in multiscale to eliminate secular terms. The Hamiltonian solution
is derived from the canonical transformation in the Hamiltonian theory of water waves. By comparing
the two types of solutions, it is found that they are completely equivalent for the first to second
order solutions and the nonlinear dispersion, but for the third order part only the sum-sum terms
are the same. Due to the canonical transformation that could completely separate the dynamic and
bound harmonics, the Hamiltonian solutions break through the difficulty that the perturbation
theory breaks down due to singularities in the transfer functions when quartet resonance criterion
is satisfied. Furthermore, it is also found that some time-averaged quantities based on the Hamiltonian
solution, such as mean potential energy and mean kinetic energy, are equal to those in the initial
state in which sea surface is assumed to be a Gaussian random process. This is because there are associated
conserved quantities in the Hamiltonian form. All of these show that the Hamiltonian solution is
more reasonable and accurate to describe the third order steady-state wave field. Finally, based
on the Hamiltonian solution, some statistics are given such as the volume flux, skewness, and excess
kurtosis.

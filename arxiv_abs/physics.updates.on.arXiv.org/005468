Recently acoustic signature of dislocation avalanches in HCP materials was found to be long tailed
in size and energy, suggesting critical dynamics. Even more recently, the intermittent plastic
response was found to be generic for micro- and nano-sized systems independently of their crystallographic
symmetry. These rather remarkable discoveries are reviewed in this paper in the perspective of
the recent studies performed in our group. We discuss the physical origin and the scaling properties
of plastic fluctuations and address the nature of their dependence on crystalline symmetry, system
size, and disorder content. A particular emphasis is placed on the associated emergent behaviors,
including the formation of dislocation structures, and on our ability to temper plastic fluctuations
by alloying. We also discuss the "smaller is wilder" size effect that culminates in a paradoxical
crack-free brittle behavior of very small, initially dislocation free crystals. We show that the
implied transition between different rheological behaviors is regulated by the ratio of length
scales $R=L/l$, where $L$ is the system size and $l$ is the internal length. We link this new size effect
with other related phenomena like size dependence of strength ("smaller is stronger") and the size
induced switch between different hardening mechanisms. One of the technological challenges in
nanoscience is to tame the intermittency of plastic flow. We show that this task can be accomplished
by generating tailored quenched disorder which allows one to control micro- and nano-scale forming
and opens new perspectives in micro-metallurgy and structural engineering of ultra-small load-carrying
elements. These results could not be achieved by conventional methods that do not explicitly consider
the stochastic nature of collective dislocation dynamics.

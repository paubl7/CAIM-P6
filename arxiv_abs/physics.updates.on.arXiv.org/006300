The stability of a pulsatile quasi-two-dimensional duct flow was numerically investigated. Flow
was driven, in concert, by a constant pressure gradient and by the synchronous oscillation of the
lateral walls. This prototypical setup serves to aid understanding of unsteady magnetohydrodynamic
flows in liquid metal coolant ducts subjected to transverse magnetic fields, motivated by the conditions
expected in magnetic confinement fusion reactors. A wide range of wall oscillation frequencies
and amplitudes were simulated. Focus was placed on the driving pulsation optimized for the greatest
reduction in the critical Reynolds number, for a range of friction parameters $H$ (proportional
to magnetic field strength). An almost $70$% reduction in the critical Reynolds number, relative
to that for the steady base flow, was obtained toward the hydrodynamic limit ($H=10^{-7}$), while
just over a $90$% reduction was obtained by $H=10$. For all oscillation amplitudes, increasing
$H$ consistently led to an increasing percentage reduction in the critical Reynolds number. This
is a promising result, given fusion relevant conditions of $H \geq 10^4$. These reductions were
obtained by selecting a frequency that both ensures prominent inflection points, and a growth in
perturbation energy in phase with deceleration of the base flow. Nonlinear simulations at the optimized
frequency and amplitude still satisfied the no net growth condition at the greatly reduced critical
Reynolds numbers. However, although the linear mode undergoes a symmetry breaking process, turbulence
was not triggered. Nonlinear base flow modulation also arrested the linear decay of the perturbation,
with exponential growth not observed at supercritical Reynolds numbers.

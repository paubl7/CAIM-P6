On-chip grating couplers directly connect photonic circuits to free-space light. The commonly
used photonic gratings have been specialized for small areas, specific intensity profiles and
non-vertical beam projection. This falls short of the precise and flexible wavefront control over
large beam areas needed to empower emerging integrated miniaturized optical systems that leverage
volumetric light matter interactions, including trapping, cooling, and interrogation of atoms,
bio- and chemi- sensing and complex free-space interconnect. The large coupler size challenges
general inverse design techniques, and solutions obtained by them are often difficult to physically
understand and generalize. Here by posing the problem to a carefully constrained computational
inverse design algorithm capable of large area structures, we discover a qualitatively new class
of grating couplers. The numerically found solutions can be understood as coupling an incident
photonic slab mode to a spatially extended slow-light (near-zero refractive index) region, backed
by a Bragg reflector. The structure forms a spectrally broad standing wave resonance at the target
wavelength, radiating vertically into free space. A reflection-less adiabatic transition critically
couples the incident photonic mode to the resonance, and the numerically optimized lower cladding
provides 70 $\%$ overall theoretical conversion efficiency. We have experimentally validated
efficient surface normal collimated emission of $\approx$ 90 $\mu$m full width at half maximum
Gaussian at the thermally tunable operating wavelength of $\approx$ 780 nm. The variable-mesh-deformation
inverse design approach scales to extra-large photonic devices, while directly implementing
the fabrication constraints. The deliberate choice of smooth parametrization resulted in a novel
type of solution, which is both efficient and physically comprehensible.

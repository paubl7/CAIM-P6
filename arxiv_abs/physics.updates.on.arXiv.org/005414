Studying the spatiotemporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infections among healthcare workers
(HCWs) can aid in protecting them from exposure. Existing studies related to HCW infections have
emphasized infection rates and protective measures. However, the spatiotemporal patterns and
related external environmental factors of HCW infections remain unclear. To fill this gap, an open-source
dataset of HCW diagnoses was provided, and the spatiotemporal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infections
among HCWs in Wuhan, China were explored. A geographical detector technique was then used to investigate
the impacts of hospital level, type, distance from the infection source, and other external indicators
of HCW infections. The results showed that the number of daily HCW infections over time in Wuhan followed
a log-normal distribution, with and its mean observed on January 23, 2020 and a standard deviation
of 10.8 days. The implementation of high-impact measures, such as the lockdown of the city, may have
increased the probability of HCW infections in the short term, especially for HCWs in the outer ring
of Wuhan. The infection of HCWs Wuhan exhibited clear spatial heterogeneity. The number of HCW infections
was higher in the central city and lower in the outer city. Moreover, HCW infections displayed significant
spatial autocorrelation and dependence. Factors analyses revealed that hospital level and type
had an even greater impact on HCW infections; third-class and general hospitals closer to infection
sources were correlated with especially high risks of infection. These findings can aid national
epidemic prevention and control departments to understand the spatiotemporal distributions
of viral transmission resulting in HCW infections, as well as external influencing factors, which
can facilitate the protection of HCWs in China.

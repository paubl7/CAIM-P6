Mechanical loads on the human spine play a crucial role in the etiology of disorders of the lower back.
In vivo evaluations are complex and highly invasive, therefore musculoskeletal biomechanical
models are used to estimate muscle forces and spinal loads during static and dynamic activities.
Subject-specific models instead of generic models have the potential to improve diagnosis and
optimize clinical treatment by predicting accurate outcomes on an individual basis. In this study,
we developed a method to model a personalized sagittal spinal alignment based on the external back
profile obtained from motion capture (MoCap) data to improve the estimation of spinal kinematics
and intervertebral joint loading. The spinal alignment adjustments proposed in this study were
applied to a full-body generic musculoskeletal model, combined from a well-validated model for
the thoracolumbar spine and a model of the lower extremities, to allow simulating predominant activities
of daily living. This novel method predicts intervertebral joint centers with an average mean error
of 0.99 +/- 0.68 cm in the frontal axis and 1.21 +/- 0.97 cm in the transverse axis relative to radiographic
reference data. The maximum mean joint prediction errors are 1.34 +/- 0.73 cm in the frontal axis
(T1/T2 joint) and 1.65 +/- 1.11 cm in the transverse axis (T3/T4 joint). The generated subject-specific
models in this study were able to reproduce spine kinematics and dynamics for each subject and derive
qualitative joint load predictions with high task repeatability. The results of this study demonstrate
the suitability of the proposed method and associated OpenSim workflow for inter- and intra-subject
investigations of muscle activity and joint reaction forces in the spine.

Traumatic brain injury can be caused by head impacts, but many brain injury risk estimation models
are less accurate across the variety of impacts that patients may undergo. In this study, we investigated
the spectral characteristics of different head impact types with kinematics classification.
Data was analyzed from 3262 head impacts from head model simulations, on-field data from American
football and mixed martial arts (MMA) using our instrumented mouthguard, and publicly available
car crash data. A random forest classifier with spectral densities of linear acceleration and angular
velocity was built to classify different types of head impacts (e.g., football, MMA), reaching
a median accuracy of 96% over 1000 random partitions of training and test sets. Furthermore, to test
the classifier on data from different measurement devices, another 271 lab-reconstructed impacts
were obtained from 5 other instrumented mouthguards with the classifier reaching over 96% accuracy
from these devices. The most important features in classification included both low-frequency
and high-frequency features, both linear acceleration features and angular velocity features.
It was found that different head impact types had different distributions of spectral densities
in low-frequency and high-frequency ranges (e.g., the spectral densities of MMA impacts were higher
in high-frequency range than in the low-frequency range). Finally, with head impact classification,
type-specific, nearest-neighbor regression models were built for 95th percentile maximum principal
strain, 95th percentile maximum principal strain in corpus callosum, and cumulative strain damage
(15th percentile). This showed a generally higher R^2-value than baseline models without classification.

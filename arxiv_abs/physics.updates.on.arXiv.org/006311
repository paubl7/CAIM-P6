The computational investigation of photochemical processes often entails the calculation of
excited state geometries, energies, and energy gradients. The nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO)
approach treats specified nuclei, typically protons, quantum mechanically on the same level as
the electrons, thereby including the associated nuclear quantum effects and non-Born-Oppenheimer
behavior into quantum chemistry calculations. The multicomponent density functional theory
(NEO-DFT) and time-dependent DFT (NEO-TDDFT) methods allow efficient calculations of ground
and excited states, respectively. Herein, the analytical gradients are derived and implemented
for the NEO-TDDFT method and the associated Tamm-Dancoff approximation (NEO-TDA). The programmable
equations for these analytical gradients, as well as the NEO-DFT analytical Hessian, are provided.
The NEO approach includes the anharmonic zero-point energy and density delocalization associated
with the quantum protons, as well as vibronic mixing, in geometry optimizations and energy calculations
of ground and excited states. The harmonic zero-point energy associated with the other nuclei can
be computed via the NEO Hessian. This approach is used to compute the 0-0 adiabatic excitation energies
for a set of nine small molecules with all protons quantized, exhibiting slight improvement over
the conventional electronic approach. Geometry optimizations of two excited state intramolecular
proton transfer systems are performed with one and two quantized protons, respectively. The NEO
calculations for these systems produce electronically excited state geometries with stronger
intramolecular hydrogen bonds and similar relative stabilities compared to conventional electronic
methods. This work provides the foundation for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of fundamental
processes such as photoinduced proton transfer and proton-coupled electron transfer.

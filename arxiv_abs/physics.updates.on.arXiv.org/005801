We present a new form of intermittency, {\it L\'evy on-off intermittency}, which arises from multiplicative
$\alpha$-stable white noise close to an instability threshold. We study this problem in the linear
and nonlinear regimes, both theoretically and numerically, for the case of a pitchfork bifurcation
with fluctuating growth rate. We compute the stationary distribution analytically and numerically
from the associated fractional Fokker-Planck equation in the Stratonovich interpretation. We
characterize the system in the parameter space $(\alpha,\beta)$ of the noise, with stability parameter
$\alpha\in (0,2)$ and skewness parameter $\beta\in[-1,1]$. Five regimes are identified in this
parameter space, in addition to the well-studied Gaussian case $\alpha=2$. Three regimes are located
at $1<\alpha<2$, where the noise has finite mean but infinite variance. They are differentiated
by $\beta$ and all display a critical transition at the deterministic instability threshold, with
on-off intermittency close to onset. Critical exponents are computed from the stationary distribution.
Each regime is characterized by a specific form of the density and specific critical exponents,
which differ starkly from the Gaussian case. A finite or infinite number of integer-order moments
may converge, depending on parameters. Two more regimes are found at $0<\alpha\leq 1$. There, the
mean of the noise diverges, and no critical transition occurs. In one case the origin is always unstable,
independently of the distance $\mu$ from the deterministic threshold. In the other case, the origin
is conversely always stable, independently of $\mu$. We thus demonstrate that an instability subject
to non-equilibrium, power-law-distributed fluctuations can display substantially different
properties than for Gaussian thermal fluctuations, in terms of statistics and critical behavior.

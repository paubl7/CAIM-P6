We present a hybrid physics-based deep learning (DL) framework for handling moving interfaces
and predicting fluid-structure interaction (FSI). Using the discretized Navier-Stokes in the
Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) reference frame, we generate full-order flow snapshots
and point-cloud displacements as target physical data for the learning and inference of fluid-structure
dynamics. This integrated operation of the physics-based modeling with the DL-based reduced-order
model (DL-ROM) makes our framework hybrid. This multi-level framework is composed of two data-driven
physics-DL drivers that predict unsteady flow and track the moving point cloud displacements respectively,
while synchronously exchange the force information at the interface. The first component relies
on the proper orthogonal decomposition-based recurrent neural network (POD-RNN) as a semi-supervised
procedure to infer the point cloud ALE description. This model essentially relies on the POD basis
modes to reduce dimensionality and evolving them in the time domain of RNN. The second component
utilizes the convolution-based recurrent autoencoder network (CRAN) as a self-supervised DL
procedure to predict the nonlinear flow dynamics at static Eulerian probes. We introduce these
probes as spatially structured query nodes in the moving point cloud to resolve the field Lagrangian
to Eulerian conflict and conveniently train the CRAN driver. We design a novel snapshot-field transfer
and load recovery (FTLR) algorithm to optimally select the Eulerian probes by recovering bulk force
quantities. A prototypical problem of flow past a freely oscillating cylinder is selected to test
the efficacy of the proposed methodology. The framework tracks the interface description and predicts
highly non-linear wake dynamics for nearly 500 time-steps. These results further the application
of digital twinning of FSI engineering systems.

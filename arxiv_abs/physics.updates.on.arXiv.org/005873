Vaccination against COVID-19 with the recently approved mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer)
and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) is currently underway in a large number of countries. However, high incidence
rates and rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants are concerning. In combination with acute supply
deficits in Europe in early 2021, the question arises of whether stretching the vaccine, for instance
by delaying the second dose, can make a significant contribution to preventing deaths, despite
associated risks such as lower vaccine efficacy, the potential emergence of escape mutants, enhancement,
waning immunity, reduced social acceptance of off-label vaccination, and liability shifts. A
quantitative epidemiological assessment of risks and benefits of non-standard vaccination protocols
remains elusive. To clarify the situation and to provide a quantitative epidemiological foundation
we develop a stochastic epidemiological model that integrates specific vaccine rollout protocols
into a risk-group structured infectious disease dynamical model. Using the situation and conditions
in Germany as a reference system, we show that delaying the second vaccine dose is expected to prevent
deaths in the four to five digit range, should the incidence resurge. We show that this considerable
public health benefit relies on the fact that both mRNA vaccines provide substantial protection
against severe COVID-19 and death beginning 12 to 14 days after the first dose. The benefits of protocol
change are attenuated should vaccine compliance decrease substantially. To quantify the impact
of protocol change on vaccination adherence we performed a large-scale online survey. We find that,
in Germany, changing vaccination protocols may lead to small reductions in vaccination intention.
In sum, we therefore expect the benefits of a strategy change to remain substantial and stable.

The present work numerically investigates the influence of radiation on the natural convection
in differentially heated slender and square-base tall cavities at low operating temperature range
of 288.1-307.7 K. The atmospheric air which has the composition of $N_2$, $O_2$, $CO_2$ and $H_2O$
in the molar mass proportion of 75.964%, 21%, 0.036% and 3%, respectively, has been considered as
the working fluid in the cavities. The non-gray and gray Planck mean absorption coefficients for
whole spectrum of the air at the atmospheric pressure and average temperature of the cavity have
been calculated from HITEMP-2010 database by Line-By-Line (LBL) approach. The flow and heat transfer
simulations for combined radiation and natural convection have been performed for four different
scenarios, i.e., pure convection, radiation in transparent, gray, and non-gray radiation medium.
First, the numerical results are compared with the experimental results of Betts and Bukhari [1]
for the slender cavity case, subsequently a comprehensive analysis of the fluid flow and heat transfer
are presented to demonstrate the influence of the radiation on natural convection inside both the
cavities. The flow structure has been visualized by Q-criterion - a vortex identification technique.
The results reveal that the fluid flow and thermal characteristics change significantly at the
top and the bottom of both the cavities with the inclusion of radiation. Moreover, the radiation
in gray medium has significant effect on these characteristics. The fluid flow and heat transfer
are only happening in a narrow regions near to the active walls. The radiative flux is in the same order
of the conductive flux in these cavities and these fluxes are almost same in all four scenarios of
the radiation modeling.

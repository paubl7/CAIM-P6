We present observations of the same magnetic cloud made near Earth by the Advance Composition Explorer
(ACE), Wind, and the Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's
Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) mission comprising the Time History of Events and Macroscale
Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) B and THEMIS C spacecraft, and later by Juno at a distance
of 1.2 AU. The spacecraft were close to radial alignment throughout the event, with a longitudinal
separation of $3.6^{\circ}$ between Juno and the spacecraft near Earth. The magnetic cloud likely
originated from a filament eruption on 22 October 2011 at 00:05 UT, and caused a strong geomagnetic
storm at Earth commencing on 24 October. Observations of the magnetic cloud at each spacecraft have
been analysed using Minimum Variance Analysis and two flux rope fitting models, Lundquist and Gold-Hoyle,
to give the orientation of the flux rope axis. We explore the effect different trailing edge boundaries
have on the results of each analysis method, and find a clear difference between the orientations
of the flux rope axis at the near-Earth spacecraft and Juno, independent of the analysis method.
The axial magnetic field strength and the radial width of the flux rope are calculated using both
observations and fitting parameters and their relationship with heliocentric distance is investigated.
Differences in results between the near-Earth spacecraft and Juno are attributed not only to the
radial separation, but to the small longitudinal separation which resulted in a surprisingly large
difference in the in situ observations between the spacecraft. This case study demonstrates the
utility of Juno cruise data as a new opportunity to study magnetic clouds beyond 1 AU, and the need
for caution in future radial alignment studies.

Four-wave mixing (FWM) is an important nonlinear optical phenomenon that underlines many of the
discoveries and device applications since the laser was invented. Examples include parametric
amplification, mode-locked pulses and frequency combs, and in the quantum optics regime, entangled-photon
generation, squeezed-state production and optical transduction from the visible to infrared
wavelengths. For quantum dot systems, the basic understanding of FWM is limited by the conventional
investigation method, which concentrates on the FWM susceptibility measured with optical amplifiers.
This paper addresses this weakness by performing laser experiments to account for all optical nonlinearities
contributing to the FWM signal. Meanwhile, we gain valuable insight into the intricate interplay
among optical nonlinearities. Using quantum dot lasers directly grown on silicon, we achieved
FWM conversion efficiency sufficient to demonstrate self-mode-locking in a single-section laser
diode, with sub-ps mode-locked pulse duration and kHz frequency-comb linewidth. A comparison
with first-principles based multimode laser theory indicates measured FWM conversion efficiencies
that are close to the theoretical limit. An advantage over earlier studies and crucial to confidence
in the results are the quality and reproducibility of state-of-the-art quantum dot lasers. They
make possible the detailed study of conversion efficiency over a broad parameter space, and the
identification of the importance of p-doping. Systematic improvement based on our understanding
of underlying physics will lead to transform limited performance and effective compensation of
intrinsic and extrinsic effects, such as linewidth enhancement and background dispersion. The
integration of FWM with lasing impacts numerous optoelectronic components used in telecom and
datacom.

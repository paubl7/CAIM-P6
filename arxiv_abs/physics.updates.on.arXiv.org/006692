In this paper, a unified gas-kinetic wave-particle scheme (UGKWP) for the disperse dilute gas-particle
multiphase flow is proposed. The gas phase is always in the hydrodynamic regime. However, the particle
phase covers different flow regimes from particle trajectory crossing to the hydrodynamic wave
interaction with the variation of local particle phase Knudsen number. The UGKWP is an appropriate
method for the capturing of the multiscale transport mechanism in the particle phase through its
coupled wave-particle formulation. In the regime with intensive particle collision, the evolution
of solid particle will be followed by the analytic wave with quasi-equilibrium distribution; while
in the rarefied regime the non-equilibrium particle phase will be captured through particle tracking
and collision, which plays a decisive role in recovering particle trajectory crossing behavior.
The gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) is employed for the simulation of gas flow. In the highly collision
regime for the particles, no particles will be sampled in UGKWP and the wave formulation for solid
particle with the hydrodynamic gas phase will reduce the system to the two-fluid Eulerian model.
On the other hand, in the collisionless regime for the solid particle, the free transport of solid
particle will be followed in UGKWP, and coupled system will return to the Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation
for the gas and particle. The scheme will be tested for in all flow regimes, which include the non-equilibrium
particle trajectory crossing, the particle concentration under different Knudsen number, and
the dispersion of particle flow with the variation of Stokes number. A experiment of shock-induced
particle bed fluidization is simulated and the results are compared with experimental measurements.
These numerical solutions validate suitability of the proposed scheme for the simulation of gas-particle
multiphase flow.

Chiral optical effects are generally quantified along some specific incident directions of exciting
waves (especially for extrinsic chiralities of achiral structures) or defined as direction-independent
properties by averaging the responses among all structure orientations. Though of great significance
for various applications, chirality extremization (maximized or minimized) with respect to incident
directions or structure orientations have not been explored, especially in a systematic manner.
In this study we examine the chiral responses of open photonic structures from perspectives of quasi-normal
modes and polarization singularities of their far-field radiations. The nontrivial topology
of the momentum sphere secures the existence of singularity directions along which mode radiations
are either circularly or linearly polarized. When plane waves are incident along those directions,
the reciprocity ensures ideal maximization and minimization of optical chiralities, for corresponding
mode radiations of circular and linear polarizations respectively. For directions of general
elliptical polarizations, we have unveiled the subtle equality of a Stokes parameter and the circular
dichroism, showing that an intrinsically chiral structure can unexpectedly exhibit no chirality
at all or even chiralities of opposite handedness for different incident directions. The framework
we establish can be applied to not only finite scattering bodies but also infinite periodic structures,
encompassing both intrinsic and extrinsic optical chiralities. We have effectively merged two
vibrant disciplines of chiral and singular optics, which can potentially trigger more optical
chirality-singularity related interdisciplinary studies.

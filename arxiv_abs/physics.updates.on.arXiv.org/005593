We elaborate on quantum geometric information flows, QGIFs, and emergent (modified) Einstein-Maxwell
and Kaluza-Klein, KK, theories formulated in Lagrange-Hamilton and general covariant variables.
There are considered nonholonomic deformations of Grigory Perelman's F- and W-functionals (originally
postulated for Riemannian metrics) for describing relativistic geometric flows, gravity and
matter field interactions, and associated statistical thermodynamic systems. We argue that the
concept of Perelman W-entropy presents more general and alternative possibilities to characterize
geometric flow evolution, GIF, and gravity models than the Bekenstein-Hawking and another area-holographic
type entropies. Formulating the theory of QGIFs, a set of fundamental geometric, probability,
and quantum concepts, and methods of computation, are reconsidered for curved spacetime and (relativistic)
phase spaces. Such generalized metric-affine spaces are modeled as nonholonomic Lorentz manifolds,
(co) tangent Lorentz bundles, and associated vector bundles. Using geometric and entropic and
thermodynamic values, we define QGIF versions of the von Neumann entropy, relative and conditional
entropy, mutual information, etc. There are analyzed certain important inequalities and possible
applications of G. Perelman and related entanglement and R\'{e}nyi entropies to theories of KK
QGIFs and emergent gravitational and electromagnetic interactions. New classes of exact cosmological
solutions for GIFs and respective quasiperiodic evolution scenarios are elaborated. We show how
classical and quantum thermodynamic values can be computed for cosmological quasiperiodic solutions
and speculate how such constructions can be used for explaining structure formation in dark energy
and dark matter physics.

Purpose: Magnetization transfer (MT) and inhomogeneous MT (ihMT) contrasts are used in MRI to provide
information about macromolecular tissue content. In particular, MT is sensitive to macromolecules
and ihMT appears to be specific to myelinated tissue. This study proposes a technique to characterize
MT and ihMT properties from a single acquisition, producing both semiquantitative contrast ratios,
and quantitative parameter maps. Theory and Methods: Building upon previous work that uses multiband
radiofrequency (RF) pulses to efficiently generate ihMT contrast, we propose a cyclic-steady-state
approach that cycles between multiband and single-band pulses to boost the achieved contrast.
Resultant time-variable signals are reminiscent of a magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF)
acquisition, except that the signal fluctuations are entirely mediated by magnetization transfer
effects. A dictionary-based low-rank inversion method is used to reconstruct the resulting images
and to produce both semiquantitative MT ratio (MTR) and ihMT ratio (ihMTR) maps, as well as quantitative
parameter estimates corresponding to an ihMT tissue model. Results: Phantom and in vivo brain data
acquired at 1.5T demonstrate the expected contrast trends, with ihMTR maps showing contrast more
specific to white matter (WM), as has been reported by others. Quantitative estimation of semisolid
fraction and dipolar T1 was also possible and yielded measurements consistent with literature
values in the brain. Conclusions: By cycling between multiband and single-band pulses, an entirely
magnetization transfer mediated 'fingerprinting' method was demonstrated. This proof-of-concept
approach can be used to generate semiquantitative maps and quantitatively estimate some macromolecular
specific tissue parameters.

Dynamics of the particle phase in a particle laden turbulent flow is highly influenced by the fluctuating
velocity and vorticity field of the fluid phase. The present work mainly focuses on exploring the
possibility of applying a Langevin type of random torque model to predict the rotational dynamics
of the particle phase. Towards this objective, direct numerical simulations (DNS) have been carried
out for particle laden turbulent shear flow with Reynolds number, $Re_\delta=750$ in presence
of sub-Kolmogorov sized inertial particles (Stokes number >>1). The inter-particle and wall-particle
interactions have also been considered to be elastic. From the particle equation of rotational
motion, we arrive at the expression where the fluctuating angular acceleration fluctuation $\alpha'_i$
of the particle is expressed as the ratio of a linear combination of fluctuating rotational velocities
of particle $\omega'_i$ and fluid angular velocity $\Omega'_i$ to the particle rotational relaxation
time $\tau_r$. The analysis was done using p.d.f plots and Jensen-Shannon Divergence based method
to assess the similarity of the particle net rotational acceleration distribution $f(\alpha'_i)$,
with (i) the distributions of particle acceleration component arising from fluctuating fluid
angular velocity computed in the particle-Largrangian frame $f(\Omega'_i/\tau_r)_{pl}$, (ii)
fluctuating particle angular velocity $f(\omega'_i/\tau_r)_{pl}$, and (iii) the fluid angular
velocity $(\Omega'_i/\tau_r)_{e}$, computed in the fluid Eulerian grids. The analysis leads
to the conclusion that $f(\alpha'_i)$ can be modeled with a Gaussian white noise using a pre-estimated
strength which can be calculated from the temporal correlation of $(\Omega'_i/\tau_r)_{e}$.

The ability to tailor laser light on a chip using integrated photonics has allowed for extensive
control over fundamental light-matter interactions in manifold quantum systems including atoms,
trapped ions, quantum dots, and defect centers. Free electrons, enabling high-resolution microscopy
for decades, are increasingly becoming the subject of laser-based quantum manipulation. Using
free-space optical excitation and intense laser pulses, this has led to the observation of free-electron
quantum walks, attosecond electron pulses, and imaging of electromagnetic fields. Enhancing
the interaction with electron beams through chip-based photonics promises unique applications
in nanoscale quantum control and sensing, but has yet to enter the realm of electron microscopy.
Here, we merge integrated photonics with electron microscopy, demonstrating coherent phase modulation
of a continuous electron beam using a silicon nitride microresonator driven by a continuous-wave
laser. The high-Q factor ($Q_0 \sim 10^6$) cavity enhancement and a waveguide designed for phase
matching lead to efficient electron-light scattering at unprecedentedly low, few-microwatt
optical powers. Specifically, we fully deplete the initial electron state at a cavity-coupled
power of $6~\mathrm{\mu W}$ and create ${>}~500$ photon sidebands for only $38~\mathrm{mW}$ in
the bus waveguide. Providing simultaneous optical and electronic spectroscopy of the resonant
cavity, the fiber-coupled photonic structures feature single-mode electron-light interaction
with full control over the input and output channels. This approach establishes a versatile framework
for exploring free-electron quantum optics, with future developments in strong coupling, local
quantum probing, and electron-photon entanglement. Our results highlight the potential of integrated
photonics to efficiently interface free electrons and light.

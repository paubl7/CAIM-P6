In order to better understand the hydroplaning phenomenon, local velocity measurements of water
flow are performed inside the tire grooves of a real car rolling through a water puddle. Velocity
fields are obtained by combining refraction Particle Image Velocimetry (r-PIV) illumination,
seeding fluorescent particles and either the classical 2D2C or a 2D3C stereoscopic recording arrangements.
The presence of some bubble columns inside the grooves is highlighted by separate visualisation
using fluorescent contrast technique evidencing two phase flow characteristics. A simple predictive
model is proposed supporting the r-PIV analysis. It provides useful information to adjust the focusing
distance and to understand the effect of the bubble column presence on the recorded r-PIV images,
especially for the seeding particles located in the upper part of the grooves, as fluorescent light
is attenuated by the bubbles. Also, the predictions provided by the model are compatible with the
measurements. The velocity fields inside the grooves are analysed using ensemble averaging performed
over a set of independent snapshots, recorded with the same operating parameters. The variability
of the longitudinal velocity distribution measured in a groove for several independent runs is
explained by different mechanisms, like the random position of fluorescent seeding particles
at various height of the groove, the hydrodynamic interactions between longitudinal and transverse
grooves, and the random location of the transverse grooves from one run to an other. Three velocity
components in cross-sections of the longitudinal grooves are obtained using the stereoscopic
arrangement. They are compatible with the presence of some longitudinal vortices also assumed
in the litterature.

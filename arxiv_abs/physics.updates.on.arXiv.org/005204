Knowledge of bubble and drop size distributions in two-phase flows is important for characterizing
a wide range of phenomena, including combustor ignition, sonar communication, and cloud formation.
The physical mechanisms driving the background flow also drive the time evolution of these distributions.
Accurate and robust identification and tracking algorithms for the dispersed phase are necessary
to reliably measure this evolution and thereby quantify the underlying mechanisms in interface-resolving
flow simulations. The identification of individual bubbles and drops traditionally relies on
an algorithm used to identify connected regions. This traditional algorithm can be sensitive to
the presence of spurious structures. A cost-effective refinement is proposed to maximize volume
accuracy while minimizing the identification of spurious bubbles and drops. An accurate identification
scheme is crucial for distinguishing bubble and drop pairs with large size ratios. The identified
bubbles and drops need to be tracked in time to obtain breakup and coalescence statistics that characterize
the evolution of the size distribution, including breakup and coalescence frequencies, and the
probability distributions of parent and child bubble and drop sizes. An algorithm based on mass
conservation is proposed to construct bubble and drop lineages using simulation snapshots that
are not necessarily from consecutive time-steps. These lineages are then used to detect breakup
and coalescence events, and obtain the desired statistics. Accurate identification of large-size-ratio
bubble and drop pairs enables accurate detection of breakup and coalescence events over a large
size range. Together, these algorithms enable insights into the mechanisms behind bubble and drop
formation and evolution in flows of practical importance.

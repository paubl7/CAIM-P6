The requirement for accelerated and quantitatively accurate screening of NMR spectra across the
small molecules chemical compound space (CCS), is two-fold: (1) a robust `local' machine learning
(ML) strategy that captures the correlation between an atom's neighbourhood in a molecule and its
`near-sighted' property---chemical shielding of its nuclear magnetic moment by the bonding electron
density; (2) an accurate reference dataset generated with a state-of-the-art first principles
method that can be used for training the ML model. Herein we report the QM9-NMR dataset comprising
isotropic shielding of $^{13}$C nucleus of over 0.8 Million C atoms in 134k molecules of the QM9 dataset
calculated at the mPW1PW91/6-311+G(2{\it d},{\it p}) level in gas phase and with implicit models
of five common solvents. Using these accurate data for training, we present benchmark results for
the prediction transferability of kernel-ridge regression models with popular local descriptors.
When using the FCHL descriptor, our models based on 100k training samples, accurately predict the
NMR shielding of 50k `hold-out' atoms with an MAE of $<1.9$ ppm. For rapid prediction of new query
molecules, the ML models have been trained with molecular geometries calculated with the semi-empirical
method PM7. Furthermore, we show by using $^{13}$C shifts from single point minimal basis set DFT
calculations at the PM7 geometries as a baseline, one can apply a $\Delta$-ML strategy to quench
the average prediction error to $<1.4$ ppm. We test the transferability of the local ML models trained
on small molecules---with up to 9 heavy atoms---to non-trivial benchmark sets that include several
large drug molecules, a small subset of the GDB17 dataset with molecules comprising 10 to 17 heavy
atoms, and linear polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with 10--26 C atoms.

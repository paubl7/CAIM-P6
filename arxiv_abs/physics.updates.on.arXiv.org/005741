Closure phase is the phase of a closed-loop product of correlations within a $\ge 3$-element interferometer
array. Its invariance to element-based phase corruption makes it invaluable for interferometric
applications that otherwise require high-accuracy phase calibration. However, its understanding
has remained mainly mathematical and limited to the aperture plane (Fourier dual of image plane).
Here, we lay the foundations for a geometrical insight. We develop a shape-orientation-size (SOS)
conservation theorem for images made from a closed triad of elements, in which the relative location
of the Null Phase Curves (NPCs) of the three interferometer responses (``fringes'') are preserved,
even in the presence of large element-based phase errors, besides overall translation of the fringe
pattern. We present two geometric methods to measure closure phase directly in the image plane (without
an aperture-plane view) with a 3-element array: (i) the closure phase is measurable from the position
offset of one fringe NPC from the intersection of the other two fringe NPCs, and (ii) the squared closure
phase is proportional to the product of the areas enclosed by the triad of array elements and the three
fringe NPCs in the aperture and image planes, respectively. We validate this geometric understanding
across a wide range range of interferometric conditions using data from the Very Large Array and
the Event Horizon Telescope. We generalize these geometric relationships to an N-element interferometer.
This geometric insight can be potentially valuable to other interferometric applications including
optical interferometry. Close parallels between interferometric closure phases, structure
invariants in crystallography, interferometric synthetic aperture radar and seismic imaging,
gravitational wave time-delay interferometry, and phases of Bargmann invariants in quantum mechanics
are highlighted.

The existence of passivating layers at the interfaces is a major factor enabling modern lithium-ion
(Li-ion) batteries. Their properties determine the cycle life, performance, and safety of batteries.
A special case is the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a heterogeneous multi-component film
formed due to the instability and subsequent decomposition of the electrolyte at the surface of
the anode. The SEI acts as a passivating layer that hinders further electrolyte disintegration,
which is detrimental to the Coulombic efficiency. In this work, we use first-principles simulations
to investigate the kinetic and electronic properties of the interface between lithium fluoride
(LiF) and lithium carbonate (Li$_2$CO$_3$), two common SEI components present in Li-ion batteries
with organic liquid electrolytes. We find a coherent interface between these components that restricts
the strain in each of them to below 3%. We find that the interface causes a large increase in the formation
energy of the Frenkel defect, generating Li vacancies in LiF and Li interstitials in Li$_2$CO$_3$
responsible for transport. On the other hand, the Li interstitial hopping barrier is reduced from
$0.3$ eV in bulk Li$_2$CO$_3$ to $0.10$ or $0.22$ eV in the interfacial structure considered, demonstrating
the favorable role of the interface. Controlling these two effects in a heterogeneous SEI is crucial
for maintaining fast ion transport in the SEI. We further perform Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics
simulations to explore Li ion conduction in our interfacial structure, which reveal an enhanced
Li ion diffusion in the vicinity of the interface. Understanding the interfacial properties of
the multiphase SEI represents an important frontier to enable next-generation batteries.

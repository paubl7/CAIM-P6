Biophysical models of diffusion in white matter have been center-stage over the past two decades
and are essentially based on what is now commonly referred to as the "Standard Model" (SM) of non-exchanging
compartments with Gaussian diffusion. In this work, we focus on diffusion MRI in cortical gray matter,
which requires rethinking basic microstructure modeling blocks. In particular, at least three
contributions beyond the SM need to be considered for gray matter: water exchange across the cell
membrane - between neurites and the extracellular space; non-Gaussian diffusion along cellular
processes - resulting from structural disorder; and signal contribution from soma. For the first
contribution, we propose Neurite Exchange Imaging (NEXI) as an extension of the SM of diffusion,
which builds on the anisotropic Karger model of two exchanging compartments. Using multi-shell
multi-t datasets acquired in the rat brain in vivo, we investigate the suitability of NEXI to describe
the diffusion signal in the cortex, compared to the other two possible contributions. In the light
of minimal diffusion time-dependence, kurtosis decaying with diffusion time as approximately
1/t and lower signal for longer diffusion times at high b, we identify exchange as the mechanism that
best explains these signal signatures in both low-b and high-b regime, and thereby propose NEXI
as the minimal model for cortex microstructure mapping. We finally highlight multi-shell multi-t
acquisitions protocols as being best suited to estimate NEXI model parameters reliably. Using
this approach, we estimate the inter-compartment water exchange time to be 20 - 60 ms in the rat cortex
in vivo, which is of the same order or shorter than the diffusion time in typical diffusion MRI acquisitions.

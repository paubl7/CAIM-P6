Detection faults in seismic data is a crucial step for seismic structural interpretation, reservoir
characterization and well placement, and it is full of challenges. Some recent works regard fault
detection as an image segmentation task. The task of image segmentation requires a large amount
of data labels, especially 3D seismic data, which has a complex structure and a lot of noise. Therefore,
its annotation requires expert experience and a huge workload, wrong labeling and missing labeling
will affect the segmentation performance of the model. In this study, we present a new binary cross-entropy
and smooth L1 loss ({\lambda}-BCE and {\lambda}-smooth L1) to effectively train 3D-CNN by sampling
some 2D slices from 3D seismic data, so that the model can learn the segmentation of 3D seismic data
from a few 2D slices. In order to fully extract information from limited and low-dimensional data
and suppress seismic noise, we propose an attention module that can be used for active supervision
training (Active Attention Module, AAM) and embedded in the network to participate in the differentiation
and optimization of the model. During training, the attention heatmap target is generated by the
original binary label, and letting it supervise the attention module using the {\lambda}-smooth
L1 loss. Qualitative experiments show that our method can extract 3D seismic features from a few
2D slices labels on real data, to segment a complete fault volume. Through visualization, the segmentation
effect achieves state-of-the-art. Quantitative experiments on synthetic data prove the effectiveness
of our training method and attention module. Experiments show that using our method, labeling one
2D slice every 30 frames at least (3.3% of the original label), the model can achieve a segmentation
performance similar to that of a 3D label.

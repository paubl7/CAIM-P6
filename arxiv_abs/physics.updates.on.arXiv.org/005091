We study the numerical solution of scalar time-harmonic wave equations on unbounded domains which
can be split into a bounded interior domain of primary interest and an exterior domain with separable
geometry. To compute the solution in the interior domain, approximations to the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
(DtN) map of the exterior domain have to be imposed as transparent boundary conditions on the artificial
coupling boundary. Although the DtN map can be computed by separation of variables, it is a nonlocal
operator with dense matrix representations, and hence computationally inefficient. Therefore,
approximations of DtN maps by sparse matrices, usually involving additional degrees of freedom,
have been studied intensively in the literature using a variety of approaches including different
types of infinite elements, local non-reflecting boundary conditions, and perfectly matched
layers. The entries of these sparse matrices are derived analytically, e.g. from transformations
or asymptotic expansions of solutions to the differential equation in the exterior domain. In contrast,
in this paper we propose to `learn' the matrix entries from the DtN map in its separated form by solving
an optimization problem as a preprocessing step. Theoretical considerations suggest that the
approximation quality of learned infinite elements improves exponentially with increasing number
of infinite element degrees of freedom, which is confirmed in numerical experiments. These numerical
studies also show that learned infinite elements outperform state-of-the-art methods for the
Helmholtz equation. At the same time, learned infinite elements are much more flexible than traditional
methods as they, e.g., work similarly well for exterior domains involving strong reflections,
for example, for the atmosphere of the Sun, which is strongly inhomogeneous and exhibits reflections
at the corona.

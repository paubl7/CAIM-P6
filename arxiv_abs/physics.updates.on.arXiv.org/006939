High frequency thickness mode ultrasound is an energy-efficient way to atomize high-viscosity
fluid at high flow rate into fine aerosol mists of micron-sized droplet distributions. However
the complex physics of the atomization process is not well understood. It is found that with low power
the droplet vibrates at low frequency (O[100 Hz]) when driven by high-frequency ultrasound (O[1
MHz] and above). To study the mechanism of the energy transfer that spans these vastly different
timescales, we measure the droplet's interfacial response to 6.6~MHz ultrasound excitation using
high-speed digital holography. We show that the onset of low-frequency capillary waves is driven
by feedback interplay between the acoustic radiation pressure distribution and the droplet surface.
These dynamics are mediated by the Young-Laplace boundary between the droplet interior and ambient
environment. Numerical simulations are performed via global optimization against the rigorously
defined interfacial physics. The proposed pressure-interface feedback model is explicitly based
on the pressure distribution hypothesis. For low power acoustic excitation, the simulations reveal
a stable oscillatory feedback that induces capillary wave formation. The simulation results are
confirmed with direct observations of the microscale droplet interface dynamics as provided by
the high resolution holographic measurements. The pressure-interface feedback model accurately
predicts the on-source vibration amplitude required to initiate capillary waves, and interfacial
oscillation amplitude and frequency. The radiation pressure distribution is likewise confirmed
with particle migration observations. Viscous effects on wave attenuation are also studied by
comparing experimental and simulated results for a pure water droplet and 90% wt.- 10% wt. glycerol-water
solution droplet.

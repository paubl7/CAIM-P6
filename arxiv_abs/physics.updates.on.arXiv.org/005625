Three-dimensional geophysical fluids support both internal and boundary-trapped waves. To obtain
the normal modes in such fluids we must solve a differential eigenvalue problem for the vertical
structure (for simplicity, we only consider horizontally periodic domains). If the boundaries
are dynamically inert (e.g., rigid boundaries in the Boussinesq internal wave problem, flat boundaries
in the quasigeostrophic Rossby wave problem) the resulting eigenvalue problem typically has a
Sturm-Liouville form and the properties of such problems are well-known. However, when restoring
forces are also present at the boundaries, then the equations of motion contain a time-derivative
in the boundary conditions and this leads to an eigenvalue problem where the eigenvalue appears
in the boundary conditions. This article develops the mathematical theory of such problems and
explores the novel properties of wave problems with dynamically active boundaries. Physically,
the presence of a restoring force at the boundary leads to an additional wave (e.g., surface gravity
wave, topographic Rossby wave) and this boundary-trapped wave allows us to expand a larger collection
of physical states in terms of these modes. The vertical structure of these waves depends on the horizontal
wavevector, they satisfy an indefinite orthogonality relation containing Dirac delta contributions,
and they may have jump discontinuities at the boundaries. Additionally, such problems include
a $\delta$-sheet formulation analogous to the Bretherton (1966) interpretation of boundary buoyancy
gradients as infinitely thin sheets of potential vorticity. We apply the theory to four examples:
two Boussinesq problems with a free-surface and two quasigeostrophic problems with a sloping lower
boundary.

The present study aims to extend the applicability of the static-boundary absorption method in
phase-resolving CFD simulations outside the conventional shallow-water waves limit. Even though
this method was originally formulated for shallow-water waves based on the conventional piston
type wavemaker, extending its use to deeper water conditions provides a more practical and computationally
cost efficient solution compared to other available numerical wave absorption alternatives.
For this sake, absorption of unidirectional monochromatic waves in a semi-infinite flume by means
of a static wall is investigated theoretically and numerically. Moreover, implementation to a
practical wave-structure interaction application is investigated numerically and experimentally.
A phase-resolving numerical model based on the Reynold-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations
is implemented using the open source C++ toolbox OpenFOAM. The study presents the performance of
the static-boundary method, in a dimensionless manner, by limiting the depth at which the active-absorption
conventional-piston velocity profile is introduced; as a function of incident wave conditions.
Moreover, it is shown that the performance of the static-boundary method can be significantly enhanced
where wave reflection was reduced to about half of that of the conventional setup in deep-water conditions.
Furthermore, the absorption depth is correlated to the incident wave conditions; providing an
optimization framework for the selection of the proper dimensions of an absorbing wall. Finally,
wave-structure interaction experimental tests were conducted to validate the numerical model
performance; which shows an acceptable agreement between the model and the experimental observations.
The proposed limiter is straight forward to be applied in pre-existing wave-structure interaction
CFD solvers, without the need of code modifications.

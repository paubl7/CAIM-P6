Purpose: To achieve free-breathing quantitative fat and $R_2^*$ mapping of the liver using model-based
iterative reconstruction, dubbed as MERLOT. Methods: For acquisition, we use a multi-echo radial
FLASH (fast low-angle shot) sequence that acquires multiple echoes with different complementary
radial spoke encodings. We investigate real-time single-slice and volumetric multi-echo radial
acquisition. Model-based reconstruction based on generalized nonlinear inversion is used to
jointly estimate water, fat, $R_2^*$, $B_0$ field inhomogeneity, and coil sensitivity maps from
the multi-coil multi-echo radial spokes. Spatial smoothness regularization is applied onto the
$B_0$ field and coil sensitivity maps, whereas joint sparsity regularization is employed for the
other parameter maps. The method integrates calibration-less parallel imaging and compressed
sensing and was implemented in Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART). For the volumetric
acquisition, the respiratory motion is resolved with self-gating using Adapted Singular Spectrum
Analysis (SSA-FARY). The quantitative accuracy of the proposed method was validated via numerical
simulation, the NIST phantom, a water/fat phantom, and in in-vivo liver studies. Results: For real-time
acquisition, the proposed model-based reconstruction allowed acquisition of dynamic liver fat
fraction and $R_2^*$ maps at a temporal resolution of 0.3 seconds per frame. For the volumetric acquisition,
whole liver coverage could be achieved in under 2 minutes using the self-gated motion-resolved
reconstruction. Conclusion: The proposed multi-echo radial sampling sequence achieves fast
k-space coverage and is robust to motion. The proposed model-based reconstruction yields spatially
and temporally resolved liver fat fraction, $R_2^*$ and $B_0$ field maps at high undersampling
factor and with volume coverage.

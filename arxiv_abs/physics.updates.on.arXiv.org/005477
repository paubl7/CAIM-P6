Free energies govern the behavior of soft and liquid matter, and improving their predictions could
have a large impact on the development of drugs, electrolytes and homogeneous catalysts. Unfortunately,
it is challenging to devise an accurate description of effects governing solvation such as hydrogen-bonding,
van der Waals interactions, or entropy and conformational sampling. We present a Free energy Machine
Learning (FML) model applicable throughout chemical compound space and based on a representation
that employs computationally efficient Boltzmann averages for an approximated sampling of configurational
space. Using the FreeSolv database, FML's out-of-sample prediction errors of experimental hydration
free energies decay systematically with training set size, and experimental uncertainty (0.6
kcal/mol) is reached after training on 80\% (490 molecules). Corresponding FML model errors are
on par or better than state-of-the art, physics based, legacy approaches. To generate the input
representation for a new query compound, the FML requires approximate and short molecular dynamics
runs. We showcase the usefulness of FML through analysis of predicted solvation free energies for
116k organic molecules (all force-field compatible molecules in QM9 database) identifying the
most and least solvated systems, and rediscovering quasi-linear structure property relationships
in terms of hydrogen-bond donors, number of NH or OH groups, number of oxygen atoms in hydrocarbons,
and number of heavy atoms. FML's accuracy is maximal when the temperature used for the molecular
dynamics simulation to generate averaged input representation samples in training is the same
as for the query compounds. The sampling time for the representation converges with respect to the
model's prediction error for both, training and testing.

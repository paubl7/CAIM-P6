Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as a promising optoelectronic
platform. To leverage their full potential, however, it is important to understand and engineer
the properties of the different exciton species that exist in these monolayers, as well as to control
their transport through the material. A promising approach relies on engineering strain landscapes
in atomically thin semiconductors that excitons navigate. In WSe$_2$ monolayers, for example,
localized strain has been used to control the emission wavelength of excitons, induce exciton funneling
and conversion, and even realize single-photon sources and quantum dots. Before these phenomena
can be fully leveraged for applications, including quantum information processing, the details
of excitons' interaction with the strain landscape must be well understood. To address this, we
have developed a cryogenic technique capable of probing the dynamics of both bright and dark excitons
in nanoscale strain landscapes in TMDs. In our approach, a nanosculpted tapered optical fiber is
used to simultaneously generate strain and probe the near-field optical response of WSe$_2$ monolayers
at 5 K. When the monolayer is pushed by the fiber, its lowest energy photoluminescence (PL) peaks
red shift by as much as 390 meV, (corresponding to 20% of the bandgap of an unstrained WSe$_2$ monolayer).
The red-shifting peaks are polarized perpendicularly to the WSe$_2$ plane and have long rising
times (10 ps) and lifetimes (52 ps), indicating that they originate from nominally spin-forbidden
dark excitons. Taken together, these observations indicate that dark excitons are funneled to
the high-strain regions during their long lifetime and are the principal participants in drift
and diffusion at cryogenic temperatures. Our work elucidates the important role that dark excitons
play in locally strained WSe$_2$.

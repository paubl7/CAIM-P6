In this work, we extend the analyses devoted to Newtonian viscous fluids previously reported by
Ribe [Physical Review E 68, 036305 (2003)], by investigating shear thickening (dilatant) and shear
thinning (pseudoplastic) effects on the development of folding instabilities in non-Newtonian
viscous sheets of which viscosity is given by a power-law constitutive equation. Such instabilities
are trigged by compression stresses acting on viscous sheets that leave a channel at a very small
initial velocity, fall, and then hit a solid surface or a fluid substrate. Our study is conducted
through a mixed approach combining direct numerical simulations, energy budget analyses, scaling
laws, and experiments. The numerical results are based on an adaptive variational multi-scale
method for multiphase flows, while Carpobol gel sheets are considered for the conducted experiments.
Two folding regimes are observed: (1) the viscous regime; and (2) the gravitational one. Interestingly,
only the latter is affected by shear thinning/thickening manifestations within the material.
In short, when gravity is balanced by viscous forces along the non-Newtonian viscous sheet, both
the folding amplitude and the folding frequency are given by a power-law function of the sheet slenderness,
the Galileo number (the ratio of the gravitational stress to the viscous one), and the flow behaviour
index. Highly shear thickening materials develop large amplitude (and low frequency) instabilities,
which, in contrast, tend to be suppressed by shear thinning effects, and eventually cease. Lastly,
nonNewtonian effects on folding onset/cessation are also carefully explored. As a result, non-Newtonian
folding onset and cessation criteria are presented.

Throughout our history, we, humans, have sought to better control and understand our environment.
To this end, we have extended our natural senses with a host of sensors-tools that enable us to detect
both the very large, such as the merging of two black holes at a distance of 1.3 billion light-years
from Earth, and the very small, such as the identification of individual viral particles from a complex
mixture. This dissertation is devoted to studying the physical mechanisms that govern a tiny, yet
highly versatile sensor: the biological nanopore. Biological nanopores are protein molecules
that form nanometer-sized apertures in lipid membranes. When an individual molecule passes through
this aperture (i.e., "translocates"), the temporary disturbance of the ionic current caused by
its passage reveals valuable information on its identity and properties. Despite this seemingly
straightforward sensing principle, the complexity of the interactions between the nanopore and
the translocating molecule implies that it is often very challenging to unambiguously link the
changes in the ionic current with the precise physical phenomena that cause them. It is here that
the computational methods employed in this dissertation have the potential to shine, as they are
capable of modeling nearly all aspects of the sensing process with near atomistic precision. Beyond
familiarizing the reader with the concepts and state-of-the-art of the nanopore field, the primary
goals of this dissertation are fourfold: (1) Develop methodologies for accurate modeling of biological
nanopores; (2) Investigate the equilibrium electrostatics of biological nanopores; (3) Elucidate
the trapping behavior of a protein inside a biological nanopore; and (4) Mapping the transport properties
of a biological nanopore. In the first results chapter of this thesis (Chapter 3), we used 3D equilibrium
simulations [...]

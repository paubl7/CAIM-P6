Here, we discuss a collection of cutting-edge techniques and applications in use today by some of
the leading experts in the field of correlative approaches in single-molecule biophysics. A key
difference in emphasis, compared with traditional single-molecule biophysics approaches detailed
previously, is on the emphasis of the development and use of complex methods which explicitly combine
multiple approaches to increase biological insights at the single-molecule level. These so-called
correlative single-molecule biophysics methods rely on multiple, orthogonal tools and analysis,
as opposed to any one single driving technique. Importantly, they span both in vivo and in vitro biological
systems as well as the interfaces between theory and experiment in often highly integrated ways,
very different to earlier traditional non-integrative approaches. The first applications of
correlative single-molecule methods involved adaption of a range of different experimental technologies
to the same biological sample whose measurements were synchronised. However, now we find a greater
flora of integrated methods emerging that include approaches applied to different samples at different
times and yet still permit useful molecular-scale correlations to be performed. The resultant
findings often enable far greater precision of length and time scales of measurements, and a more
understanding of the interplay between different processes in the same cell. Many new correlative
single-molecule biophysics techniques also include more complex, physiologically relevant
approaches as well as increasing number that combine advanced computational methods and mathematical
analysis with experimental tools. Here we review the motivation behind the development of correlative
single-molecule microscopy methods, its history and recent progress in the field.

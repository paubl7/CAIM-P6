This paper explores static non-uniform grid solvers that adapt three raster-based flood models
on an optimised non-uniform grid: the second-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG2) model representing
the modelled data as piecewise-planar fields, the first-order finite volume (FV1) model using
piecewise-constant fields, and the local inertial (ACC) model only evolving piecewise-constant
water depth fields. The optimised grid is generated by applying the multiresolution analysis (MRA)
of multiwavelets (MWs) to piecewise-planar representation of raster-formatted topography data,
for more sensible grid coarsening based on one user-specified parameter. Two adaptive solvers
are also explored that apply the MRA of MWs and of Haar wavelets (HWs) to, respectively, scale and
adapt the DG2 (MWDG2) and FV1 (HWFV1) modelled data dynamically in time. The performance of the non-uniform
grid and adaptive solvers is assessed in terms of flood depth and extent, velocities, and CPU runtimes,
with reference to the raster-based DG2 model predictions on their finest resolution grid. The assessments
considered three large-scale flooding scenarios, involving rapid and slow-to-gradual flows.
MWDG2 is found to be the most favourable choice when modelling rapid flows, where it excels in capturing
small velocity variations. For slow-to-gradual flows, the adaptive solvers deliver less accurate
outcomes, and their efficiency can be hampered by overhead costs of the dynamic MRA. Instead, non-uniform
DG2 is recommended to capture urban flow interactions more accurately. Non-uniform ACC is 5 times
faster to run than non-uniform DG2 but delivers close flooding depth and extent predictions, thus
is more attractive for fluvial/pluvial flood simulation over large areas.

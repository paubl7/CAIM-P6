Among the ODEs peculiarities -- specially those of Mechanics -- besides the problem of leading them
to quadratures and to solve them either in series or in closed form, one is faced with the inversion.
E.g. when one wishes to pass from time as function of lagrangian coordinates to these last as functions
of time. This paper solves in almost closed form the system of non linear ODEs of the 2D-motion (say,
co-ordinates $\theta$ and $\psi$) of a gravity-free double pendulum (GFDP) not subjected to any
force. In such a way its movement is ruled by initial conditions only. The relevant strongly non linear
ODEs, have been put back to hyper-elliptic quadratures which, through the Integral Representation
Theorem (hereinafter IRT) have been driven to the Lauricella hypergeometric functions $F_D^{(j)},
j=3, 4, 5, 6 $. The IRT has been applied after a change of variable which improves their use and accelerates
the series convergence. The $\psi$ is given in terms of $F_D^{(4)}$ -- which is inverted by means
of the Fourier Series tool and put as an argument inside the $F_D^{(5)}$ -- in such a way allowing the
$\theta$ computations. We succeed in a insight knowledge of time laws and trajectories of both bobs
forming the GFDP, which -- after the inversion -- is therefore completely solved in explicit closed
form. Suitable sample problems of the three possible cases of motion are carried out and their analysis
closes the work. The Lauricella functions employed here to solve the differential equations --
in lack of specific SW packages -- have been implemented thanks to some reduction theorems which
will form the object of a next paper. To our best knowledge, this work adds a new contribution as it
concerns detection and inversion of solutions of nonlinear hamiltonian systems.

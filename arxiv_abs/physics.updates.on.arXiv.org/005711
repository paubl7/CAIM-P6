In this article we describe a unifying framework for variational electromagnetic particle schemes
of spectral type, and we propose a novel spectral Particle-In-Cell (PIC) scheme that preserves
a discrete Hamiltonian structure. Our work is based on a new abstract variational derivation of
particle schemes which builds on a de Rham complex where Low's Lagrangian is discretized using a
particle approximation of the distribution function. In this framework, which extends the recent
Finite Element based Geometric Electromagnetic PIC (GEMPIC) method to a variety of field solvers,
the discretization of the electromagnetic potentials and fields is represented by a de Rham sequence
of compatible spaces, and the particle-field coupling procedure is described by approximation
operators that commute with the differential operators in the sequence. In particular, for spectral
Maxwell solvers the choice of truncated $L^2$ projections using continuous Fourier transform
coefficients for the commuting approximation operators yields the gridless Particle-in-Fourier
method, whereas spectral Particle-in-Cell methods are obtained by using discrete Fourier transform
coefficients computed from a grid. By introducing a new sequence of spectral pseudo-differential
approximation operators, we then obtain a novel variational spectral PIC method with discrete
Hamiltonian structure that we call Fourier-GEMPIC. Fully discrete schemes are then derived using
a Hamiltonian splitting procedure, leading to explicit time steps that preserve the Gauss laws
and the discrete Poisson bracket associated with the Hamiltonian structure. These explicit steps
share many similarities with standard spectral PIC methods. As arbitrary filters are allowed in
our framework, we also discuss aliasing errors and study a natural back-filtering procedure to
mitigate the damping caused by anti-aliasing smoothing particle shapes.

Electric field measurements of the Time Domain Sampler (TDS) receiver, a part of the Radio and Plasma
Waves (RPW) instrument on-board Solar Orbiter, often exhibit very intense broadband wave emissions
at frequencies below 20~kHz in the spacecraft frame. During the first year of the mission, the RPW/TDS
instrument has been operating from the first perihelion in mid-June 2020 and through the first flyby
of Venus in late December 2020. In this paper, a year-long study of electrostatic fluctuations observed
in the solar wind at an interval of heliocentric distances from 0.5 to 1~AU is shown. The on-board
processed properties of waveform snapshots that are continuously collected allow mapping plasma
waves at frequencies between 200~Hz and 20~kHz. For a detailed spectral and polarization analysis,
the triggered waveform snapshots and a Doppler-shifted solution of the dispersion relation for
wave mode identification were used. The occurrence rate of low-frequency waves peaks around perihelion
at distances of 0.5~AU and decreases with increasing distances, with only a few waves detected per
day at 0.9~AU. A more detailed analysis of more than ten thousand triggered waveform snapshots shows
the median wave frequency at about 2.3~kHz and wave amplitude about 1.1~mV/m. The relative phase
distribution between two components of E-field projected in the Y-Z Spacecraft Reference Frame
(SRF) plane shows a mostly linear wave polarization. Electric field fluctuations are closely aligned
with the directions of the ambient field lines. The observed waves are interpreted as the strongly
Doppler-shifted electrostatic ion-acoustic mode generated by the resonant interaction with
ion beams or by the current-driven instability.

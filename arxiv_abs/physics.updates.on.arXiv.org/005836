The discovery of Electromagnetism by Oersted (1820) started an 'extraordinary decennium' ended
by the discovery of electromagnetic induction by Faraday (1831). During this decennium, in several
experiments, the electromagnetic induction was there, but it was not seen or recognized. Faraday
built up a local theory of electromagnetic induction based on the idea that there is an induced current
when there is an intersection between lines of magnetic force and a conductor in relative motion.
In 1873, Maxwell, within a Lagrangian description of electric currents, wrote down a 'general law
of electromagnetic induction' in which a fundamental role is played by the vector potential. A modern
reformulation of Maxwell's general law is based on the definition of the induced emf as the line integral
of the Lorentz force on a unit positive charge and the use of the equation that relates the electric
field to the potentials. Maxwell's general law has been rapidly forgotten; instead, the "flux rule"
has deeply taken root. The "flux rule" not always yields the correct prediction, it does not say where
the induced emf is localized, it requires ad hoc choices of the integration paths. It is not a physical
law but only a calculation tool. To understand why Maxwell's `general law' has been forgotten, also
a sample of representative textbooks, distributed over about a century, has been analyzed. In this
framework, a part of the paper deals with the idea of rotating lines of magnetic force, falsified
by Faraday, but common in the first decades of the Twentieth century and astonishingly resumed recently.
It is shown that this hypothesis is incompatible with Maxwell - Lorentz - Einstein electromagnetism
and that it is falsified also by recent experiments. Finally, the electromagnetic induction in
some recent research papers is briefly discussed.

Weakly nonlinear internal wave-wave interaction is a key mechanism that cascades energy from large
to small scales, leading to ocean turbulence and mixing. Oceans typically have a non-uniform density
stratification profile; moreover, submarine topography leads to a spatially varying ocean depth
($h$). Under these conditions and assuming mild-slope bathymetry, we employ multiple-scale analysis
to derive the wave amplitude equations for triadic- and self-interactions. The waves are assumed
to have a slowly (rapidly) varying amplitude (phase) in space and time. For uniform stratifications,
the horizontal wavenumber ($k$) condition for waves ($1$,$2$,$3$), given by ${k}_{(1,a)}+{k}_{(2,b)}+{k}_{(3,c)}=0$,
is unaffected as $h$ is varied, where $(a,b,c)$ denote the modenumber. Moreover, the nonlinear
coupling coefficients (NLC) are proportional to $1/h^2$, implying that triadic waves grow faster
while travelling up a seamount. For non-uniform stratifications, triads that do not satisfy the
condition $a=b=c$ may not satisfy the horizontal wavenumber condition as $h$ is varied, and unlike
uniform stratification, the NLC may not decrease (increase) monotonically with increasing (decreasing)
$h$. NLC, and hence wave growth rates for both triads and self-interactions, can also vary rapidly
with $h$. The most unstable daughter wave combination of a triad with a mode-1 parent wave can also
change for relatively small changes in $h$. We also investigate higher-order self-interactions
in the presence of a monochromatic, small amplitude bathymetry; here the bathymetry behaves as
a zero frequency wave. We derive the amplitude evolution equations and show that higher-order self-interactions
might be a viable mechanism of energy cascade.

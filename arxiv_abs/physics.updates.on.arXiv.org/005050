The evaporation of dispersed, liquid droplets in jet-sprays occurs in several industrial applications
and in natural phenomena. Despite the relevance of the problem, a satisfactory comprehension of
the mechanisms involved has not still be achieved because of the wide range of turbulent scales and
the huge number of droplets involved. In this context, we address a DNS of a turbulent jet spray at
relatively high Reynolds number, i.e. Re=10,000. We focus on the effect of the jet Re on the evaporation
process and the preferential segregation of droplets, comparing the outcomes also with a DNS at
lower Reynolds number, Re = 6,000, in corresponding conditions. The problem is addressed in the
hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian framework employing the point-droplet approximation. Detailed
statistical analysis on both the gas and dispersed phases are presented. We found that the droplet
vaporization length grows as the bulk Re is increased from Re = 6,000 to Re = 10,000 keeping other conditions
fixed. We attribute this result to the complex interaction between the inertia of the droplets and
the turbulent gaseous phase dynamics. In particular, at higher Re, the slower droplet mass transfer
is not able to comply with the faster turbulent fluctuations of the mixing layer that tend to fasten
the process. We also found an intense droplet clustering which is originated by entrainment of dry
air in the mixing layer and intensified by the small-scale clustering mechanism in the far-field
region. We will show how clustering creates a strongly heterogeneous droplet Lagrangian evolution.
All these aspects contribute to the Re dependence of the overall droplet evaporation rate. Finally,
we discuss the accuracy of the d-square law, often used in spray modeling, for present cases. We found
that using this law based on environmental conditions the droplet evaporation rate is overestimated.

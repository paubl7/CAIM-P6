Paper materials are natural composite materials and well-known to be hydrophilic unless chemical
and mechanical processing treatments are undertaken. The relative humidity impacts the fiber
elasticity, the fiber-fiber bonds and the failure mechanism. In this work, we present a comprehensive
experimental and computational study on the mechanical and failure behaviour of the fiber and the
fiber network under humidity influence. The manually extracted cellulose fiber is exposed to different
levels of humidity, and then mechanically characterized using Atomic Force Microscopy, which
delivers the humidity dependent longitudinal Young's modulus. The obtained relationship allows
calculation of fiber elastic modulus at any humidity level. Moreover, by using Confoncal Laser
Scanning Microscopy, the coefficient of hygroscopic expansion of the fibers is determined. On
the other hand, we present a finite element model to simulate the deformation and the failure of the
fiber network. The model includes the fiber anisotropy and the hygroscopic expansion using the
experimentally determined constants. In addition, it regards the fiber-fiber bonding and damage
by using a humidity dependent cohesive zone interface model. Finite element simulations on exemplary
fiber network samples are performed to demonstrate the influence of different aspects including
relative humidity and fiber-fiber bonding parameters on the mechanical features such as force-elongation
curves, wet strength, extensiability and the local fiber-fiber debonding. In meantime, fiber
network failure in a locally wetted region is revealed by tracking of individually stained fibers
using in-situ imaging techniques. Both the experimental data and the cohesive finite element simulations
demonstrate the pull-out of fibers and imply the significant role of the fiber-fiber debonding
in the failure process of the wet paper.

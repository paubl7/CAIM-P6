We present results from the first deployment of novel, high definition, compact gas Time Projection
Chambers (TPCs) with pixel chip readout as part of the BEAST II beam background measurement project
at SuperKEKB. The TPCs provide detailed 3D imaging of ionization from neutron-induced nuclear
recoils in a helium and carbon dioxide target gas mixture at standard temperature and pressure.
We find excellent electron background rejection, leading to background-free nuclear recoil measurements
above 50 keVee, despite the extreme high-background environment. We measure an angular resolution
better than 20{\deg} for recoil tracks longer than 1.7 mm, corresponding to an average ionization
energy of ~100 keVee. We also obtain the 3D vector direction of helium recoils by utilizing charge
profile measurements along the recoil axis, with a correct head/tail assignment efficiency of
approximately 80%. With this performance, we present comparisons between measured and simulated
event rates, recoil energy spectra, and directional distributions originating from beam-gas
and Touschek beam losses at SuperKEKB. We utilize head/tail recognition to distinguish neutron
components travelling with positive radial velocity in the Belle II coordinate system from those
with opposite directionality. Finally, we present a novel method of discriminating beam-gas interactions
from Touschek beam losses that can eliminate the need for dedicated accelerator runs for background
measurements. This method is still statistics-limited. However, future studies should be able
to verify this method, which in turn could lead to neutron background analysis runs symbiotic with
normal Belle II operation. The capabilities demonstrated here also suggest that high definition
recoil imaging in gas TPCs is applicable to low energy, low-background experiments, such as directional
dark matter searches.

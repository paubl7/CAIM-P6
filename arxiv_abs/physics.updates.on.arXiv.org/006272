Space agencies have been incessantly working to propose a sustainable architecture for human Mars
mission. But, before proceeding to a giant leap and accomplishing those mission intent, it is significant
to know the extent of possibility to expand terrestrial species on the vast red planet. Decades of
scientific exploration and experimentation through planetary landers and rovers showed uncertain
and unsatisfactory results to determine the possibility of life on Mars. Consequently, the technological
limitation has impeded to perform in-situ experimentation and analysis on the surface. Therefore,
we require soil samples through Mars sample return vehicles for superior analysis in our ground-based
laboratories or on-orbit analysis aboard International Space Station from the aspect of planetary
protection policy. Sampling analysis either in ground or orbit will report the presence of fundamental
constituents to harbor life. To effectuate this intent, we have proposed a unique sample return
architecture integrated with large solar Montgolfier. Here, we deploy parachute and retro propulsion
thrusters to deliver sample return vehicles on to the surface and systematic ascend with the aid
of solar Montgolfier to propel the MSRV out of Mars atmosphere. Subsequently, the MSRV effectuates
orbital rendezvous with orbiter for the refueling process and safe return. The proposed concept
is cheap, robust and simple as compared to the current state of MSR architectures ultimately minimizing
the technological necessities. It also detains backup plans that were found to be nowhere presented
in any of sample return strategies. Further, we have extended our discussion to comprehensively
analyze entire MSR architecture with our concept for mission feasibility.

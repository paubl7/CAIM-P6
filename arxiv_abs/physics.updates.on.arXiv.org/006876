We propose a novel approach and algorithm based on two preliminary tests of the optical system elements
to enhance the super-resolved complex-valued imaging. The approach is developed for inverse phase
imaging in a single-shot lensless optical setup. Imaging is based on wavefront modulation by a single
binary phase mask. The preliminary tests compensate errors in the optical system and correct a carrying
wavefront, reducing the gap between real-life experiments and computational modeling, which
improve imaging significantly both qualitatively and quantitatively. These two tests are performed
for observation of the laser beam and phase mask along, and might be considered as a preliminary system
calibration. The corrected carrying wavefront is embedded into the proposed iterative Single-shot
Super-Resolution Phase Retrieval (SSR-PR) algorithm. Improved initial diffraction pattern
upsampling, and a combination of sparse and deep learning based filters achieves the super-resolved
reconstructions. Simulations and physical experiments demonstrate the high-quality super-resolution
phase imaging. In the simulations, we showed that the SSR-PR algorithm corrects the errors of the
proposed optical system and reconstructs phase details 4x smaller than the sensor pixel size. In
physical experiment 2um thick lines of USAF phase-target were resolved, which is almost 2x smaller
than the sensor pixel size and corresponds to the smallest resolvable group of used test target.
For phase bio-imaging, we provide Buccal Epithelial Cells reconstructed in computational super-resolution
and the quality was of the same level as a digital holographic system with 40x magnification objective.
Furthermore, the single-shot advantage provides the possibility to record dynamic scenes, where
the framerate is limited only by the used camera. We provide amplitude-phase video clip of a moving
alive single-celled eukaryote.

In this paper, we present the results of a numerical study of air-water turbulent bubbly flow in a
periodic vertical square duct. The study is conducted using a novel numerical technique which leverages
Volume of Fluid method for interface capturing and Sharp Surface Force method for accurate representation
of the surface tension forces. A three-dimensional geometry construction method is employed during
solution of interface equation which gives absolute conservation of mass and sharp interface between
gas and liquid phases. The entire algorithm has been implemented on a data parallel mode on multiple
graphics processing units (GPU) taking advantage of the large number of available cores. We have
studied the dynamics of a swarm of spherical bubbles co-flowing with the upward turbulent flow and
compared results with an unladen turbulent flow. The frictional Reynolds number of the unladen
$Re_{\tau}$ is 360, which is sufficient to sustain a turbulent flow. We observe the turbulence-driven
secondary flows in the mean flow, with complex instantaneous turbulent vortical structures. The
interaction of these secondary flows with the upwards rising bubbles is very complex and leads to
significant changes in the instantaneous and time-averaged flow field. We present the results
of mean void fraction distribution, mean velocities, longitudinal and transverse turbulence
intensities along the wall, corner bisector, and wall bisector. A peak in the void fraction distribution
near the walls is observed representing the migration of bubbles to a preferred section of the duct.
The effects of turbulence-driven secondary flows and instantaneous large eddies on preferential
concentration of the bubbles are discussed. The dispersed bubbles are seen to break the long elongated
turbulent structures commonly observed in the unladen turbulent flow.

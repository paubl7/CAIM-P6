In this work, the analysis of oblique anti-plane shear waves propagation and scattering in low frequency
resonant micro-structured layered media with viscoelastic constituent layers is presented.
The band structure of the infinitely periodic systems and scattering off a finite thickness slab
of such media are determined using the transfer matrix method. A consistent dynamic field homogenization
approach is applied, in which the micro-scale field equations are integrated and the overall macro-scale
quantities are defined to be compatible with these integral forms. A reduced set of constitutive
tensors is presented for general asymmetric repeating unit cells (RUC), utilizing the proposed
homogenized macro-scale quantities combined with Onsager's principle and presumed material
form of elastodynamic reciprocity. This set can be further restricted by studying the form of the
dispersion equation leading to a unique constitutive tensor. It is shown that for an asymmetric
RUC, the full constitutive tensor are required to match the scattering and band structure of the
micro-structured media, but all the off-diagonal parameters vanish for a symmetric RUC. Therefore,
it is possible to create an equivalent homogenized representation with a uniquely determined diagonal
constitutive tensor for a symmetric RUC, though, as is the case also with asymmetric RUCs, all non-zero
components will be wave-vector dependent. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the
application and consistency of the proposed method. All the diagonal terms are converging to their
appropriate Voigt or Reuss averages at the long-wavelength limit for all wave directions. The wave-vector
dependent nature of the off-diagonal coupling constants can still be observed even in this limit.
The conditions for lossy or lossless systems are presented and are shown to impose weak requirements
on overall constitutive tensors.

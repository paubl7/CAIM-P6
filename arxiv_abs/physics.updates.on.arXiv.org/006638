Plasma response to resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) near the pedestal top is crucial for
accessing edge localized modes (ELMs) suppression in tokamaks. Since radial location of rotation
zero-crossing plays a key role in determining the threshold for field penetration of RMP, plasma
response may be different in low input torque plasmas. In this work, the linear MHD code MARS-F is
applied to reveal the dependence of plasma response to RMP on rotation zero-crossing by a scan of
rotation profiles based on an EAST equilibrium. It is shown that the plasma response is enhanced
when zero-crossing occurs near rational surfaces. The dependence of plasma response on the location
of rotation zero-crossing is well fitted by a double Gaussian, indicating two effects in this enhancement.
One is induced by rotation screening effect shown as a wide base (with a width around 10-20 krad/s),
and the other is related to resistive singular layer effect characterized by a localized peak (with
a width around 3-4 krad/s). The width of the peak scales with the resistive singular layer width.
The plasma displacement suggests the response is tearing like when zero-crossing is within the
singular layer, while it is kink like when zero-crossing is far from the layer. The enhancement of
magnetic islands width at the peak is only around a factor of two, when the absolute value of local
rotation is not larger than 10-20 krad/s. It is further confirmed in a modeling of plasma response
in an EAST ELM suppression discharge. Though there is a zero-crossing in $E\times B$ rotation but
not in electron perpendicular rotation, no significant difference in plasma response is obtained
using these two rotation profiles. This suggests that the rotation near pedestal top should not
be far away from zero but may not be necessary to have zero-crossing for accessing ELM suppression.

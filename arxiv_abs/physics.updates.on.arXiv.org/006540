We develop a versatile optimization method, which finds the design parameters that minimize time-averaged
acoustic cost functionals. The method is gradient-free, model-informed, and data-driven with
reservoir computing based on echo state networks. First, we analyse the predictive capabilities
of echo state networks both in the short- and long-time prediction of the dynamics. We find that both
fully data-driven and model-informed architectures learn the chaotic acoustic dynamics, both
time-accurately and statistically. Informing the training with a physical reduced-order model
with one acoustic mode markedly improves the accuracy and robustness of the echo state networks,
whilst keeping the computational cost low. Echo state networks offer accurate predictions of the
long-time dynamics, which would be otherwise expensive by integrating the governing equations
to evaluate the time-averaged quantity to optimize. Second, we couple echo state networks with
a Bayesian technique to explore the design thermoacoustic parameter space. The computational
method is minimally intrusive. Third, we find the set of flame parameters that minimize the time-averaged
acoustic energy of chaotic oscillations, which are caused by the positive feedback with a heat source,
such as a flame in gas turbines or rocket motors. These oscillations are known as thermoacoustic
oscillations. The optimal set of flame parameters is found with the same accuracy as brute-force
grid search, but with a convergence rate that is more than one order of magnitude faster. This work
opens up new possibilities for non-intrusive (``hands-off'') optimization of chaotic systems,
in which the cost of generating data, for example from high-fidelity simulations and experiments,
is high.

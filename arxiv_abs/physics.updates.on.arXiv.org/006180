To say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder means that beauty is largely subjective so varies from
person to person. While the subjectivity view is commonly held, there is also an objectivity view
that seeks to measure beauty or aesthetics in some quantitative manners. Christopher Alexander
has long discovered that beauty or coherence highly correlates to the number of subsymmetries or
substructures and demonstrated that there is a shared notion of beauty - structural beauty - among
people and even different peoples, regardless of their faiths, cultures, and ethnicities. This
notion of structural beauty arises directly out of living structure or wholeness, a physical and
mathematical structure that underlies all space and matter. Based on the concept of living structure,
this paper develops an approach for computing the structural beauty or life of an image (L) based
on the number of automatically derived substructures (S) and their inherent hierarchy (H). To verify
this approach, we conducted a series of case studies applied to eight pairs of images including Leonardo
da Vinci's Mona Lisa and Jackson Pollock's Blue Poles. We discovered among others that Blue Poles
is more structurally beautiful than the Mona Lisa, and traditional buildings are in general more
structurally beautiful than their modernist counterparts. This finding implies that goodness
of things or images is largely a matter of fact rather than an opinion or personal preference as conventionally
conceived. The research on structural beauty has deep implications on many disciplines, where
beauty or aesthetics is a major concern such as image understanding and computer vision, architecture
and urban design, humanities and arts, neurophysiology, and psychology. Keywords: Life; wholeness;

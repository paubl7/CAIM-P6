The Heider balance addresses three-body interactions with the assumption that triads are equally
important in the dynamics of the network. In many networks, the relations do not have the same strength
so, triads are differently weighted. Now, the question is how social networks evolve to reduce the
number of unbalanced triangles when they are weighted? Are the results foreseeable based on what
we have already learned from the unweighted balance? To find the solution, we consider a fully connected
network in which triads are assigned with different random weights. Weights are coming from Gaussian
probability distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma$. We study this system in two regimes
: (\RN{1}) the ratio of $\frac{\mu}{\sigma} \ge 1 $ corresponds to weak disorder (small variance)
that triads' weight are approximately the same, (\RN{2}) $\frac{\mu}{\sigma} < 1 $ counts for strong
disorder (big variance) and weights are remarkably diverse. Investigating the structural evolution
of such a network is our intention. We see disorder plays a key role in determining the critical temperature
of the system. Using the mean-field method to present an analytic solution for the system represents
that the system undergoes a first-order phase transition. For weak disorder, our simulation results
display the system reaches the global minimum as temperature decreases whereas for high disorder
we manage to see a seudo-Kondo effect in triadic interactions. The Kondo effect explains the anomalous
increase in electrical resistivity of metals due to magnetic impurities at low temperatures. Similar
behavior is seen in the energy versus temperature in our work for the second regime and the system
does not reach a global minimum.

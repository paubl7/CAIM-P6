Based on the theoretical description of Position-Position-Velocity(PPV) statistics in Lazarian
& Pogosyan(2000), we introduce a new technique called the Velocity Decomposition Algorithm(VDA)
in separating the PPV fluctuations arising from velocity and density fluctuations. Using MHD turbulence
simulations, we demonstrate its promise in retrieving the velocity fluctuations from PPV cube
in various physical conditions and its prospects in accurately tracing the magnetic field. We find
that for localized clouds, the velocity fluctuations are most prominent at the wing part of the spectral
line, and they dominate the density fluctuations. The same velocity dominance applies to extended
HI regions undergoing galactic rotation. Our numerical experiment demonstrates that velocity
channels arising from the cold phase of atomic hydrogen (HI) are still affected by velocity fluctuations
at small scales. We apply the VDA to HI GALFA-DR2 data corresponding to the high-velocity cloud HVC186+19-114
and high latitude galactic diffuse HI data. Our study confirms the crucial role of velocity fluctuations
in explaining why linear structures are observed within PPV cubes. We discuss the implications
of VDA for both magnetic field studies and predicting polarized galactic emission that acts as the
foreground for the Cosmic Microwave Background studies. Additionally, we address the controversy
related to the filamentary nature of the HI channel maps and explain the importance of velocity fluctuations
in the formation of structures in PPV data cubes. VDA will allow astronomers to obtain velocity fluctuations
from almost every piece of spectroscopic PPV data and allow direct investigations of the turbulent
velocity field in observations.

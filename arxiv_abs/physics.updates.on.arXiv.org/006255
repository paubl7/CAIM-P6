In this article we will discuss a few aspects of the spacetime description of matter and fields. In
Section:1 we will discuss the completeness of real numbers in the context of an alternate definition
of the straight line as a geometric continuum. According to this definition, points are not regarded
as the basic constituents of a line segment and a line segment is considered to be a fundamental geometric
object. This definition is in particular suitable to coordinatize different points on the straight
line preserving the order properties of real numbers. Geometrically fundamental nature of line
segments are required in physical theories like the string theory. We will discuss the cardinality
of rational numbers in the later half of Section:1. We will first discuss what we do in an actual process
of counting and define functions well-defined on the set of all positive integers. We will follow
an alternate approach that depends on the Hausdorff topology of the real numbers to demonstrate
that the set of positive rationals can have a greater cardinality than the set of positive integers.
This approach is more consistent with an actual act of counting. This article indicates that the
axiom of choice can be a better technique to prove theorems that use second-countability. This is
important for the metrization theorems and physics of spacetime. In Section:2 we will discuss an
improved proof of the Poisson's equation. We will show that the self energy of a point charge can be
zero in the potential approach to evaluate it. In Section:3 we will discuss a few aspects of the equivalence
of the Schwarzschild coordinates and the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates. In Section:4 we will make
a few comments on general physics including the special theory of relativity and hydrodynamics.

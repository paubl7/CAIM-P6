Earth's continents are characterized by a strong enrichment in long-lived radioactive isotopes.
Recent estimates suggest that they contribute to 33\% of the heat released at the surface of the Earth,
while occupying less than 1\% of the mantle. This distinctive feature has profound implications
for the underlying mantle by impacting its thermal structure and heat transfer. However, the effects
of a continental crust enriched in heat-producing elements on the underlying mantle have not yet
been systematically investigated. Here, we conduct a preliminary investigation by considering
a simplified convective system consisting in a mixed heated fluid where all the internal heating
is concentrated in a top layer of thickness $d_{HL}$ (referred to as "heat-blanketed convection").
We perform 24 numerical simulations in 3D Cartesian geometry for four specific set-ups and various
values of $d_{HL}$. Our results suggest that the effects of the heated layer strongly depend on its
thickness relative to the thickness of the thermal boundary layer ($\delta_{TBL}$) in the homogeneous
heating case ($d_{HL} = 1.0$). More specifically, for $d_{HL} > \delta_{TBL}$, the effects induced
by the heated layer are quite modest, while, for $d_{HL} < \delta_{TBL}$, the properties of the convective
system are strongly altered as $d_{HL}$ decreases. In particular, the surface heat flux and convective
vigour are significantly enhanced for very thin heated layers compared to the case $d_{HL} = 1.0$.
The vertical distribution of heat producing elements may therefore play a key role on mantle dynamics.
For Earth, the presence of continents should however not affect significantly the surface heat
flux, and thus the Earth's cooling rate.

Direct numerical simulation is used to study turbulent flow over irregular rough surfaces in the
periodic minimal channel configuration. The generation of irregular rough surface is based on
a random algorithm, in which the power spectrum of the roughness height function along with its probability
density function can be directly prescribed. The hydrodynamic properties of the roughness are
investigated and compared to those obtained from full-size DNS for 12 roughness topographies with
systematically varied PDF and PS at four roughness height. The comparison confirms the viability
of the minimal channel approach for characterization of rough surfaces providing excellent agreement
in roughness function and zero-plane displacement across various types of roughness and different
regimes. Results also indicates that different realizations of roughness, with a fixed PS and PDF,
translate to similar values of roughness function with a small scatter. In addition to the global
flow properties, the distribution of time-averaged surface force exerted by the roughness onto
the fluid is examined and compared to the roughness height distribution for different cases. It
is shown that the surface force distribution has an anisotropic structure with spanwise-elongated
coherent regions. The anisotropy translates into a very small streamwise integral length scale,
which weakly depends on the considered roughness topography, while the larger spanwise integral
length scale shows a stronger dependence on roughness characteristics. It is also shown that the
sheltering model describes well the spatial distribution of the surface force. Finally, existing
roughness correlations are assessed using the present dataset. It was shown that the most correlations
can reproduce the values of equivalent sand-grain roughness from DNS within+-30% error while none
of the correlations shows a superior predictive accuracy.

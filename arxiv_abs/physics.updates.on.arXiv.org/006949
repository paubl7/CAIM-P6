This work is devoted to a method to generate particle cluster assemblies, and connected to evaporative
lithography. Experiments are carried out using nonuniform evaporation of an isopropanol film
containing polystyrene microspheres in a cylindrical cell. The local inhomogeneity of the vapor
flux density is achieved by exploiting the temperature gradient. A copper rod is mounted in the central
part of the bottom of the cell for further heating. The thermocapillary flow resulting from the surface
tension gradient, due in turn to the temperature drop, transfers the particles that were originally
at rest at the bottom of the cell. The effect of the initial thickness of the liquid layer on the height
and base area of the cluster formed in the central region of the cell is studied. The velocity is measured
using particle image velocimetry. A model describing the initial stage of the process is developed.
The equations of heat transfer and thermal conductivity are used to define the temperature distribution
in the liquid and in the cell. The fluid flow is simulated using the lubrication approximation. The
particle distribution is modeled using the convection-diffusion equation. The evaporation flux
density is calculated using the Hertz-Knudsen equation. The dependence of the liquid viscosity
on the particle concentration is described by Mooney's formula. Numerical results show that the
liquid film gradually becomes thinner in the central region, as the surface tension decreases with
the increasing temperature. The liquid flow is directed to the heater near the substrate, and it
transfers the particles to the center of the cell. The volume fraction of the particles increases
over time in this region. The heat flow from the heater affects the geometry of the cluster for two
reasons: first, the Marangoni flow velocity depends on the temperature gradient, and second, the
decrease ...

We develop a quantitative framework for understanding the class of wicked problems that emerge
at the intersections of natural, social, and technological complex systems. Wicked problems reflect
our incomplete understanding of interdependent global systems and the systemic risk they pose;
such problems escape solutions because they are often ill-defined, and thus mis-identified and
under-appreciated by communities of problem-solvers. While there are well-documented benefits
to tackling boundary-crossing problems from various viewpoints, the integration of diverse approaches
can nevertheless contribute confusion around the collective understanding of the core concepts
and feasible solutions. We explore this paradox by analyzing the development of both scholarly
(social) and topical (cognitive) communities -- two facets of knowledge production studies here
that contribute towards the evolution of knowledge in and around a problem, termed a knowledge trajectory
-- associated with three wicked problems: deforestation, invasive species, and wildlife trade.
We posit that saturation in the dynamics of social and cognitive diversity growth is an indicator
of reduced uncertainty in the evolution of the comprehensive knowledge trajectory emerging around
each wicked problem. Informed by comprehensive bibliometric data capturing both social and cognitive
dimensions of each problem domain, we thereby develop a framework that assesses the stability of
knowledge trajectory dynamics as an indicator of wickedness associated with conceptual and solution
uncertainty. As such, our results identify wildlife trade as a wicked problem that may be difficult
to address given recent instability in its knowledge trajectory.

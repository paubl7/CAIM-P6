Origami-inspired robots are of particular interest given their potential for rapid and accessible
design and fabrication of elegant designs and complex functionalities through cutting and folding
of flexible 2D sheets or even strings, i.e.printable manufacturing. Yet, origami robots still
require bulky, rigid components or electronics for actuation and control to accomplish tasks with
reliability, programmability, ability to output substantial force, and durability, restricting
their full potential. Here, we present a printable self-sustained compliant oscillator that generates
periodic actuation using only constant electrical power, without discrete components or electronic
control hardware. This oscillator is robust (9 out of 10 prototypes worked successfully on the first
try), configurable (with tunable periods from 3 s to 12 s), powerful (can overcome hydrodynamic
resistance to consistently propel a swimmer at ~1.6 body lengths/min), and long-lasting (~10^3
cycles); it enables driving macroscale devices with prescribed autonomous behaviors, e.g. locomotion
and sequencing. This oscillator is also fully functional underwater and in high magnetic fields.
Our analytical model characterizes essential parameters of the oscillation period, enabling
programmable design of the oscillator. The printable oscillator can be integrated into origami-inspired
systems seamlessly and monolithically, allowing rapid design and prototyping; the resulting
integrated devices are lightweight, low-cost, compliant, electronic-free, and nonmagnetic,
enabling practical applications in extreme areas. We demonstrate the functionalities of the oscillator
with: (i) autonomous gliding of a printable swimmer, (ii) LED flashing, and (iii) fluid stirring.
This work paves the way for realizing fully printable autonomous robots with a high integration
of actuation and control.

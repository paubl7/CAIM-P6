The singlemode condition is one of the most important design rules for optical waveguides in guided-wave
optics. The reason following the singlemode condition is that higher-order modes might be excited
and thus introduce some undesired mode-mismatching loss as well as inter-mode crosstalk when light
propagates along an optical waveguide beyond the singlemode regime. As a result, multimode photonic
waveguides are usually not allowed. In this paper, we propose the concept of silicon photonics beyond
the singlemode regime, developed with low-loss and low-crosstalk light propagation in multimode
photonic waveguides with broadened silicon cores. In particular, silicon photonic waveguides
with a broadened core region have shown an ultra-low-loss of ~0.1 dB/cm for the fundamental mode
even without any special fabrication process. A micro-racetrack resonator fabricated with standard
220-nm-SOI MPW-foundry processes shows a record intrinsic Q-factor as high as 1.02*107 for the
first time, corresponding to ultra-low waveguide propagation loss of only 0.065 dB/cm. A high-performance
microwave photonic filter on silicon is then realized with an ultra-narrow 3-dB bandwidth of 20.6
MHz as well as a tuning range of ~20 GHz for the first time. An on-chip 100-cm-long delayline is also
demonstrated by using the present broadened SOI photonic waveguides with compact Euler-curve
bends, the measured propagation loss is ~0.14 dB/cm. The proposed concept of silicon photonics
beyond the singlemode regime helps solve the issue of high propagation loss and also significantly
reduces the random phase errors of light due to the random variations of waveguide dimensions. In
particularity it enables silicon photonic devices with enhanced performances, which paves the
way for new-generation silicon photonics realizing the large-scale photonic integration.

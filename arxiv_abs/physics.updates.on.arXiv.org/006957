We study pressure fluctuations in direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent channel flows
at friction Reynolds numbers of approximately 180 and 550, by a comparison between analysis of DNS
data and resolvent analysis considering a linearization around the mean turbulent profile. Dominant
structures are extracted from the DNS data using wavenumber and frequency spectra, and spectral
peaks, which comprise near-wall, large-scale and spanwise-coherent structures, are further
analyzed using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD). SPOD analysis, employing a pressure
inner product, show a strong dominance of the leading mode, highlighting low-rank behaviour of
pressure fluctuations. The leading resolvent mode, considering pressure as output, agrees closely
with the first SPOD mode, providing support to recent studies that showed better performance of
resolvent-based estimators when predicting pressure fluctuations compared to velocity structures
(Amaral et al. arXiv:2011.06525, 2021). However, nonlinear terms extracted from the DNS data,
corresponding to forcing in resolvent analysis, also display low-rank behavior, with dominant
modes that differ from optimal forcings from resolvent analysis. The dominant mechanisms of analyzed
modes are seen to be the generation of streamwise or spanwise vortices, with pressure fluctuations
appearing close to vortex centers. A study on the nonlinear terms individual contributions to the
pressure output reveals that each forcing component plays a constructive role to the input-output
formulation, which simplifies modeling of forcing color. The present results further encourage
the use of simplified linear models to study wall turbulence, especially if pressure fluctuations
are of primary interest.

Recent studies have developed tunable topological elastic metamaterials to maximize performance
in the presence of varying external conditions, adapt to changing operating requirements, and
enable new functionalities such as a programmable wave path. However, a challenge remains to achieve
a tunable topological metamaterial that is comprehensively adaptable in both the frequency and
spatial domains and is effective over a broad frequency bandwidth that includes a subwavelength
regime. To advance the state of the art, this research presents a piezoelectric metamaterial with
the capability to concurrently tailor the frequency, path, and mode shape of topological waves
using resonant circuitry. In the research presented in this manuscript, the plane wave expansion
method is used to detect a frequency tunable subwavelength Dirac point in the band structure of the
periodic unit cell and discover an operating region over which topological wave propagation can
exist. Dispersion analyses for a finite strip illuminate how circuit parameters can be utilized
to adjust mode shapes corresponding to topological edge states. A further evaluation provides
insight into how increased electromechanical coupling and lattice reconfiguration can be exploited
to enhance the frequency range for topological wave propagation, increase achievable mode localization,
and attain additional edge states. Topological guided wave propagation that is subwavelength
in nature and adaptive in path, localization, and frequency is illustrated in numerical simulations
of thin plate structures. Outcomes from the presented work indicate that the easily integrable
and comprehensively tunable proposed metamaterial could be employed in applications requiring
a multitude of functions over a broad frequency bandwidth.

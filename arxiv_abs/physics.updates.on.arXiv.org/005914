A lattice of elastic Rayleigh rods organized in a parallelepiped geometry can be axially loaded
up to an arbitrary amount without distortion and then be subject to incremental time-harmonic dynamic
motion. At certain threshold levels of axial load, the grillage manifests instabilities and displays
non-trivial axial and flexural incremental vibrations. Floquet-Bloch wave asymptotics is used
to homogenize the in-plane mechanical response, so to obtain an equivalent prestressed elastic
solid subject to incremental time-harmonic vibration, which includes, as a particular case, the
incremental quasi-static response. The equivalent elastic solid is obtained from its acoustic
tensor, directly derived from homogenization and shown to be independent of the rods' rotational
inertia. Loss of strong ellipticity in the equivalent continuum coincides with macro-bifurcation
in the lattice, while micro-bifurcation remains undetected in the continuum and corresponds to
a vibration of vanishing frequency of the lowest dispersion branch of the lattice, occurring at
finite wavelength. A perturbative approach based on dynamic Green's function is applied to both
the lattice and its equivalent continuum. This shows that only macro-instability corresponds
to localization of incremental strain, while micro-instabilities occur in modes that spread throughout
the whole lattice with an 'explosive' character. Extremely localized mechanical responses are
found both in the lattice and in the solid, with the advantage that the former can be easily realized,
for instance via 3D printing. In this way, features such as shear band inclination, or the emergence
of a single shear band, or competition between micro and macro instabilities become all designable
features. The presented results pave the way for the design of architected materials to be used in
applications involving extreme deformations.

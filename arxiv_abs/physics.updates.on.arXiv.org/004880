Thick rods are employed in Nanotechnology to build modern electro mechanical systems. Design and
optimization of such structures can be carried out by nonlocal continuum mechanics which is computationally
convenient when compared to atomistic strategies. Bishop's kinematics is able to describe small-scale
thick rods if a proper mathematical model of nonlocal elasticity is formulated to capture size effects.
In all papers on the matter, nonlocal contributions are evaluated by replacing Eringen's integral
convolution with the consequent (but not equivalent) differential equation governed by Helmholtz's
differential operator. As notorious in integral equation theory, this replacement is possible
for convolutions, defined in unbounded domains, governed by averaging kernels which are Green's
functions of differential operators. Indeed, Eringen himself, in order to study nonlocal problems
defined in unbounded domains, such as screw dislocations and wave propagations, suggested to replace
integro-differential equations with differential conditions. A different scenario appears
in Bishop rod mechanics where nonlocal integral convolutions are defined in bounded structural
domains, so that Eringen's nonlocal differential equation has to be supplemented with additional
boundary conditions. The objective is achieved by formulating the governing nonlocal equations
by a proper variational statement. The new methodology provides an amendment of previous contributions
in literature and is illustrated by investigating the elastostatic behavior of simple structural
schemes. Exact solutions of Bishop rods are evaluated in terms of nonlocal parameter and cross-section
gyration radius. Both hardening and softening structural responses are predictable with a suitable
tuning of the parameters.

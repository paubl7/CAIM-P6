In this work, the critical parameters for an incompressible flow of shear-thickening power-law
fluids across a channel confined circular cylinder have been investigated numerically. The governing
equations have been solved by using finite volume method for wide range of power-law (n=1 - 1.8) fluids
and for two blockage ratio (b = 2 and 4). Transitional insights of channel confined cylinder, in particular,
critical parameters indicating transitions from creeping to separating flows (i.e., onset of
steady symmetric wake formation), and from steady symmetric wake to unsteady asymmetric wake formation
(i.e., onset of vortex formation) are investigated and presented in terms of the critical Reynolds
numbers (Re^c and Re_c). The relative impacts of unconfined and confined flows on these critical
parameters have also been explored. In general, both onsets of the flow separation and wake asymmetry
delayed with increasing values of the power-law index (n) and the wall confinement. The dependence
of critical Re on n for the confined (finite b) flow are, however, completely opposite to that for
unconfined flow, i.e., critical Re decreased with increasing n. The influence of power-law index
on the onset of vortex is quite stronger than that on onset of wake formation. For instance, Re^c for
b=(2, 4, \infty) altered from (12.5, 7.25, 6.25) to (30.5, 9.25, 0.75) and corresponding changes
with Re_c are noted from (84.5, 70.25, 46.5) to (449.5, 179.5, 33.5) as n varied from 1 to 1.8, respectively.
Stokes paradox (i.e., no creeping flow even as Re ~ 0) apparent with unconfined flow of power-law
fluids is non-relevant in confined flows. Finally, predictive correlations for critical Re as
a function of dimensionless parameters (n and b) are presented for their easy use in engineering
analysis.

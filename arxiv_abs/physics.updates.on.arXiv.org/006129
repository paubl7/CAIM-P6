The process of lunar magma ocean solidification provides constraints on the properties of distinct
chemical reservoirs in the lunar mantle that formed during the early evolution of the Moon. We use
a combination of phase equilibria models consistent with experimental results on lunar magma ocean
crystallization to study the effect of bulk silicate Moon composition on the properties of lunar
mantle reservoirs. We find that the densities and relative proportions of these mantle reservoirs,
in particular of the late forming ilmenite bearing cumulates (IBC), strongly depend on the FeO content
of the bulk silicate Moon. This relation has implications for post-magma ocean mantle dynamics
and the mass distribution in the lunar interior, because the dense IBC form at shallow depths but
tend to sink towards the core mantle boundary. We quantify the relations between bulk silicate Moon
FeO content, IBC thickness and bulk Moon density as well as mantle stratigraphy and bulk silicate
Moon moment of inertia to constrain the bulk silicate Moon FeO content and the efficiency of IBC sinking.
In combination with seismic and selenodetic constraints on mantle stratigraphy, core radius,
extent of the low velocity zone at the core mantle boundary, considerations about the present day
selenotherm and the effects of reservoir mixing by convection our model indicates that the bulk
silicate Moon is only moderately enriched in FeO compared to the Earths mantle and contains about
9.4 - 10.9 weight percent FeO (with a lowermost limit of 8.3 weight percent and an uppermost limit
of 11.9 weight percent). We also conclude that the observed bulk silicate Moon moment of inertia
requires incomplete sinking of the IBC layer by mantle convection: only 20 - 60 percent of the IBC
material might have reached the core mantle boundary, while the rest either remained at the depth
of origin or was mixed into the middle mantle.

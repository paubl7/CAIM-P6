Immense field enhancement and nanoscale confinement of light are possible within nanoparticle-on-mirror
(NPoM) plasmonic resonators, which enable novel optically-activated physical and chemical phenomena,
and render these nanocavities greatly sensitive to minute structural changes, down to the atomic
scale. Although a few of these structural parameters, primarily linked to the nanoparticle and
the mirror morphology, have been identified, the impact of molecular assembly and organization
of the spacer layer between them has often been left uncharacterized. Here, we experimentally investigate
how the complex and reconfigurable nature of a thiol-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM) adsorbed
on the mirror surface impacts the optical properties of the NPoMs. We fabricate NPoMs with distinct
molecular organizations by controlling the incubation time of the mirror in the thiol solution.
Afterwards, we investigate the structural changes that occur under laser irradiation by tracking
the bonding dipole plasmon mode, while also monitoring Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman scattering
from the molecules as a probe of their integrity. First, we find an effective decrease in the SAM height
as the laser power increases, compatible with an irreversible change of molecule orientation caused
by heating. Second, we observe that the nanocavities prepared with a densely packed and more ordered
monolayer of molecules are more prone to changes in their resonance compared to samples with sparser
and more disordered SAMs. Our measurements indicate that molecular orientation and packing on
the mirror surface play a key role in determining the stability of NPoM structures and hence highlight
the under-recognized significance of SAM characterization in the development of NPoM-based applications.

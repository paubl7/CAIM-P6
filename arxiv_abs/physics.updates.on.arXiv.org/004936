Adaptive lattice Boltzmann methods (LBMs) are based on velocity discretizations that self-adjust
to local macroscopic conditions such as velocity and temperature. While this feature improves
the accuracy and the stability of LBMs for large velocity and temperature fluctuations, it also
strongly impacts the efficiency of the algorithm due to space interpolations that are required
to get populations at grid nodes. To avoid this defect, the present work proposes new formulations
of adaptive LBMs for the simulation of compressible flows which do not rely anymore on space interpolations,
hence, drastically improving their parallel efficiency for the simulation of high-speed compressible
flows. To reach this goal, the adaptive phase discretization is restricted to particular states
that are compliant with the efficient ``collide and stream'' algorithm, and as a consequence it
does not require additional interpolation steps. The development of proper state-adaptive solvers
with on-grid propagation imposes new restrictions and challenges on the discrete stencils, namely
the need for an extended operability range allowing for the transition between two phase discretizations.
Achieving the minimum operability range for discrete polynomial equilibria requires rather large
stencils (e.g. D2Q81, D2Q121) and is therefore not competitive for compressible flow simulations.
However, as shown in the article, the use of numerical equilibria can provide for overlaps in the
operability ranges of neighboring discrete shifts at acceptable cost using the D2Q21 lattice.
Through several numerical validations, the present approach is shown to allow for an efficient
realization of discrete state-adaptive LBMs for high Mach number flows even in the low viscosity
regime.

A new model for the numerical simulation of a rigid body moving in a viscous fluid flow using FEM is
presented. One of the most interesting features of this approach is the small computational effort
required to solve the motion of the rigid body compared to a pure fluid solver. The model is based on
the idea of extending the fluid velocity inside the rigid body and solving the flow equations with
a penalization term to enforce rigid motion inside the solid. In order to get the velocity field in
the fluid domain the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible viscous flow are solved using
a fractional-step procedure combined with the two-step Taylor-Galerkin for the fractional linear
momentum. Once the velocity field in the fluid domain is computed, calculation of the rigid motion
is obtained by averaging translation and angular velocities over the solid. One of the main challenges
when dealing with the fluid-solid interaction is the proper modelling of the interface which separates
the solid moving mass from the viscous fluid. In this work the combination of the level set technique
and the two-step Taylor-Galerkin algorithm for tracking the fluid-solid interface is proposed.
The good properties exhibited by the two-step Taylor-Galerkin, minimizing oscillations and numerical
diffusion, make this method suitable to accurately advect the solid domain avoiding distortions
at its boundaries, and thus preserving the initial size and shape of the rigid body. The proposed
model has been validated against empirical solutions, experimental data and numerical simulations
found in the literature. In all tested cases, the numerical results have shown to be accurate, proving
the potential of the proposed model as a valuable tool for the numerical analysis of the fluid-solid
interaction.

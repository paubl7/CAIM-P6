Living organisms must respond to environmental changes. Generally, accurate and rapid responses
are provided by simple, unidirectional networks that connect inputs with outputs. Besides accuracy
and speed, biological responses should also be robust to environmental or intracellular noise
and mutations. Furthermore, cells must also respond to unforeseen environmental changes that
have not previously been experienced, to avoid extinction prior to the evolutionary rewiring of
their networks, which takes numerous generations. We have investigated gene regulatory networks
that mutually activate or inhibit, and have demonstrated that complex entangled networks can make
appropriate input-output relationships that satisfy the robust and adaptive responses required
for unforeseen challenges. Such entangled networks function for sloppy and unreliable responses
with low Hill coefficient reactions for the expression of each gene. To compensate for such sloppiness,
several detours in the regulatory network exist. By taking advantage of the averaging over such
detours, the network shows a higher robustness to environmental and intracellular noise as well
as to mutations in the network, when compared to simple unidirectional circuits. Furthermore,
the appropriate response to unforeseen challenges, allowing for functional outputs, is achieved
as many genes exhibit similar dynamic expression responses, irrespective of inputs, as confirmed
by applying dynamic time warping and dynamic mode decomposition. As complex entangled networks
are common in gene regulatory networks and global gene expression responses are observed in microbial
experiments, the present results provide a novel design principle for cellular networks.

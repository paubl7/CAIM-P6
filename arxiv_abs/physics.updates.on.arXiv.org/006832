It is demonstrated that the development of a nuclear fusion rocket engine based on a D $-$ $^{3}$He
(Deterium-Helium 3) technology will allow to travel in the solar system and beyond. The Direct Fusion
Drive (DFD) is the D $-$ $^{3}$He-fueled, aneutronic, thermonuclear fusion propulsion system
that is under development at Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory [1]. It is considered
and analyzed the Earth-Mars mission using the DFD. It is shown that one-way trips to Mars in slightly
more than 100 days become possible and also journeys to the asteroid belt will take about 250 days
[2]. It is presented an analysis of realistic new trajectories for a robotic mission to Saturn's
largest moon, Titan, to demonstrate the great advantages related to the thermonuclear DFD. The
trajectories calculations and analysis for Saturn's largest moon Titan different profile missions
are given based on the characteristics of a 2 MW class DFD engine. This capability results in a total
trip duration of 2.6 years for the thrust-coast-thrust profile and less than 2 years for the continuous
thrust profile [3]. Using the same 2 MW class DFD engine one can reach some trans-Neptunian object,
such as the dwarf planets Makemake, Eris, and Haumea in less than 10 years with a payload mass of at
least 1500 kg, so that it would enable all kind of missions, from scientific observation to in-situ
operations [4]. We consider for each mission a Thrust-Coast-Thrust profile. For this reason, each
mission is divided into 3 phases: i. the trajectory to escape Earth gravity influence; ii. the interplanetary
travel, from the exit of Earth sphere of influence to the end of the coasting phase; iii. maneuvers
to rendezvous with a target object. We present calculations to reach a vicinity at 125 AU.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the surface of semiconductor photoanodes involves photo-generated
holes that oxidize water. A certain fraction of the holes that reach the surface recombine with electrons
from the conduction band, giving rise to the surface recombination loss. The charge transfer efficiency,
xt, defined as the ratio between the flux of holes that contribute to the water oxidation reaction
and the total flux of holes that reach the surface, is an important parameter that helps to distinguish
between bulk and surface recombination losses. However, accurate determination of xt by conventional
voltammetry measurements is complicated because only the total current is measured and it is difficult
to discern between different contributions to the current. Chopped light measurement and hole
scavenger measurement techniques are widely employed to determine xt, but they often lead to errors.
Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) is better suited for accurate determination
of xt because it provides direct information on both the total photocurrent and the surface recombination
current. Careful analysis of IMPS measurements at different light intensities is required to account
for nonlinear effects. We compare the xt values obtained by these methods using heteroepitaxial
hematite photoanodes. A wide spread of xt values is obtained by different analysis methods and different
light sources and light intensities. Statistical analysis of the results show good correlation
between different methods for measurements carried out with the same light source, light intensity
and potential. However, there is a considerable spread in the results obtained by different methods.
For accurate determination of xt, we recommend IMPS measurements with a bias light intensity such
that the irradiance is as close as possible to the standard solar spectrum.

Volcanic eruptions are associated with a wide range of electrostatic effects. Increasing evidence
suggests that high-altitude discharges (lightning) in maturing plumes are driven by electrification
processes that require the formation of ice (analogous to processes underpinning meteorological
thunderstorms). However, electrical discharges are also common at or near the volcanic vent. A
number of "ice-free" electrification mechanisms have been proposed to account for this activity:
fractocharging, triboelectric charging, radioactive charging, and charging through induction.
Yet, the degree to which each mechanism contributes to a jet's total electrification and how electrification
in the gas-thrust region influences electrostatic processes aloft remains poorly constrained.
Here, we use a shock-tube to simulate overpressured volcanic jets capable of producing spark discharges
in the absence of ice. These discharges may be representative of the continual radio frequency (CRF)
emissions observed at a number of eruptions. Using a suite of electrostatic sensors, we demonstrate
the presence of size-dependent bipolar charging (SDBC) in a discharge-bearing flow for the first
time. SDBC has been readily associated with triboelectric charging in other contexts and provides
direct evidence that contact and frictional electrification play significant roles in electrostatic
processes in the vent and near-vent regions of an eruption. Additionally, we find that particles
leaving the region where discharges occur remain moderately electrified. This degree of electrification
may be sufficient to drive near-vent lightning higher in the column. Thus, near-vent discharges
may be underpinned by the same electrification mechanisms driving CRF, albeit involving greater
degrees of charge separation.

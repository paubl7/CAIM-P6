In this article, visible-to-ultraviolet photon upconversion (UV-UC) by triplet-triplet annihilation
in the emission range shorter than 340 nm, which is previously unexplored, is presented and the relevant
physicochemical characteristics are elucidated. Investigations were carried out in several
deaerated solvents using acridone and naphthalene derivatives as a sensitizer and emitter, respectively.
Both upconversion quantum efficiency and sample photostability under continuous photoirradiation
strongly depended on the solvent. The former dependence is governed by the solvent polarity, which
affects the triplet energy level matching between the sensitizer and emitter because of the solvatochromism
of the sensitizer. To elucidate the latter, first we investigated the photodegradation of samples
without the emitter, which revealed that the sensitizer degradation rate is correlated with the
difference between the frontier orbital energy levels of the sensitizer and solvent. Inclusion
of the emitter effectively suppressed the degradation of the sensitizer, which is ascribed to fast
quenching of the triplet sensitizer by the emitter and justifies the use of ketonic sensitizers
for UV-UC in solvents. A theoretical model was developed to acquire insight into the observed temporal
decays of the upconverted emission intensity under continuous photoirradiation. The theoretical
curves generated by this model fitted the experimental decay curves well, which allowed the reaction
rate between the emitter and solvent to be obtained. This rate was also correlated with difference
between the frontier orbital energy levels of the emitter and solvent. Finally, based on the acquired
findings, general design guidelines for developing UV-UC samples were proposed.

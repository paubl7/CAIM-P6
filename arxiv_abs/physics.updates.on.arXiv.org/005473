Numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes, Nernst-Planck, and the Poisson equations are employed
to describe the transport processes in an aqueous electrolyte in a parallel-plate nanochannel,
where surface-acoustic waves (SAWs) are standing or traveling along (piezo-active) channel walls.
It is found that -- in addition to the conventional acoustic streaming flow -- a time-averaged electroosmotic
flow is induced. Employing the stream function-vorticity formulation, it is shown that the Maxwell
stress term causes an electroosmotic propulsion that is qualitatively identical to the one discussed
in the context of alternating current (AC) electroosmosis (EOF). Differences arise mainly due
to the high actuation frequencies of SAWs, which are in the MHz range rather than in the kHz regime
typical for ACEOF. Moreover, the instantaneous spatial periodicity of the EOF in the travel direction
of the SAW is intrinsically linked to the dispersion relation of the latter rather than a free geometric
parameter. This leads to a specific frequency band where an EOF of sizable magnitude can be found.
On the low frequency end, the ratio between the electric double layer (EDL) thickness and the SAW
wavelength becomes extremely small so that the net force leading to a non-vanishing time-averaged
flow becomes equally small. On the high frequency end, the RC time of the EDL is much larger than the
inverse of the SAW frequency leading to a vanishing effective charge density of the EDL. For a parallel-plate
channel, the EOF can be maximized by using two SAWs on both channel walls that have the same frequency
but are phase-shifted by $180^\circ$. It appears that the SAW-EOF is the dominant pumping mechanism
for such a scenario. The proposed actuation might be a viable alternative for driving liquid electrolytes
through narrow ducts and channels, without the need for electric interconnects and electrodes.

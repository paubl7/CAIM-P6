This paper presents deep unfolding neural networks to handle inverse problems in photothermal
radiometry enabling super resolution (SR) imaging. Photothermal imaging is a well-known technique
in active thermography for nondestructive inspection of defects in materials such as metals or
composites. A grand challenge of active thermography is to overcome the spatial resolution limitation
imposed by heat diffusion in order to accurately resolve each defect. The photothermal SR approach
enables to extract high-frequency spatial components based on the deconvolution with the thermal
point spread function. However, stable deconvolution can only be achieved by using the sparse structure
of defect patterns, which often requires tedious, hand-crafted tuning of hyperparameters and
results in computationally intensive algorithms. On this account, Photothermal-SR-Net is proposed
in this paper, which performs deconvolution by deep unfolding considering the underlying physics.
This enables to super resolve 2D thermal images for nondestructive testing with a substantially
improved convergence rate. Since defects appear sparsely in materials, Photothermal-SR-Net
applies trained block-sparsity thresholding to the acquired thermal images in each convolutional
layer. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated and discussed using various deep unfolding
and thresholding approaches applied to 2D thermal images. Subsequently, studies are conducted
on how to increase the reconstruction quality and the computational performance of Photothermal-SR-Net
is evaluated. Thereby, it was found that the computing time for creating high-resolution images
could be significantly reduced without decreasing the reconstruction quality by using pixel binning
as a preprocessing step.

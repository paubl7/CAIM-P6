Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides contrast that reflect diffusing spins' interactions with microstructural
features of biological systems, but its specificity remains limited due to the ambiguity of its
relation to the underlying microstructure. To improve specificity, biophysical models of white
matter (WM) typically express dMRI signals according to the Standard Model (SM) and have more recently
in gray matter (GM) attempted to incorporate cell soma (the SANDI model). The validity of the assumptions
underlying these models, however, remains largely undetermined, especially in GM. Observing
the models' unique, functional properties, such as the $b^{-1/2}$ power-law associated with 1d
diffusion, has emerged as a fruitful strategy for experimental validation. The absence of this
signature in GM has been explained by neurite water exchange, non-linear morphology, and/or obscuring
soma signal contributions. Here, we present simulations in realistic neurons demonstrating that
curvature and branching does not destroy the stick power-law in impermeable neurites, but that
their signal is drowned by the soma under typical experimental conditions: Nevertheless, we identify
an attainable experimental regime in which the neurite signal dominates. Furthermore, we find
that exchange-driven time dependence produces a behavior opposite to that expected from restricted
diffusion, thereby providing a functional signature disambiguating the two effects. We present
data from dMRI experiments in ex vivo rat brain at ultrahigh field and observe a time dependence consistent
with substantial exchange and a GM stick power-law. The first finding suggests significant water
exchange while the second suggests a small sub-population of impermeable neurites. To quantify
our observations, we harness the K\"arger exchange model and incorporate the corresponding signal
time dependence in SM and SANDI.

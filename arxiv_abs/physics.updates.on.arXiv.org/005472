Aggression in online social networks has been studied mostly from the perspective of machine learning
which detects such behavior in a static context. However, the way aggression diffuses in the network
has received little attention as it embeds modeling challenges. In fact, modeling how aggression
propagates from one user to another, is an important research topic since it can enable effective
aggression monitoring, especially in media platforms which up to now apply simplistic user blocking
techniques. In this paper, we address aggression propagation modeling and minimization on Twitter,
since it is a popular microblogging platform at which aggression had several onsets. We propose
various methods building on two well-known diffusion models, Independent Cascade (IC) and Linear
Threshold (LT), to study the aggression evolution in the social network. We experimentally investigate
how well each method can model aggression propagation using real Twitter data, while varying parameters,
such as seed users selection, graph edge weighting, users' activation timing, etc. It is found that
the best performing strategies are the ones to select seed users with a degree-based approach, weigh
user edges based on their social circles' overlaps, and activate users according to their aggression
levels. We further employ the best performing models to predict which ordinary real users could
become aggressive (and vice versa) in the future, and achieve up to AUC=0.89 in this prediction task.
Finally, we investigate aggression minimization by launching competitive cascades to "inform"
and "heal" aggressors. We show that IC and LT models can be used in aggression minimization, providing
less intrusive alternatives to the blocking techniques currently employed by popular online social
network platforms.

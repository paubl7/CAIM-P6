Increased economic activity and research interest in the Arctic raise the need for better wave forecasts
in the marginal ice zone (MIZ). Mathematical and numerical models of wave propagation in sea ice
would benefit from more in situ data for validation. This study presents shipborne wave measurements
from the MIZ where altimeter readings are corrected for ship motion to obtain estimated single point
ocean surface elevation. From the combined measurements, we obtain significant wave height and
zero up-crossing period, as well as one-dimensional wave spectra. In addition, we provide spectra
and integrated parameters obtained from inertial motion units (IMU) placed on ice floes inside
the MIZ. The results are compared with integrated parameters from the WAM-4 spectral wave model
over a period of three days in the open ocean. We also compare our measurements outside and inside
the MIZ with hindcast data from the new pan-Arctic WAM-3 model and the Wave Watch III model for the
European Arctic, which both model wave attenuation in sea ice. A good agreement is found with WAM-4
and WW3 in zero up-crossing period and significant wave height outside the MIZ, where deviations
are less than 23%. WAM-3 is on the other hand up to 60% higher than observations. WW3 and WAM-3 are able
to estimate the trends for significant wave height and zero up-crossing period inside the MIZ, although
the discrepancies with respect to the observations were larger than in the open ocean. Wave damping
by sea ice is investigated by looking at the spatial attenuation coefficients. Predicted attenuation
coefficients are found to be 72-83% smaller for WW3 and 3-64% larger for WAM-3 compared to observations.
Hence, further model tuning is necessary to better estimate wave parameters in the ice.

The hydrodynamics of droplets is significant in wide-ranging applications involving immiscible
fluids and emulsions in food and pharmaceutical. The control and manipulation of droplets are primarily
a function of flow governing and geometrical parameters. The finite element and level set approaches
are used in this work to explore the influences of capillary number (Ca) and flow rate ratio (Qr) of
dispersed and continuous phases on hydrodynamics of droplet generation in two-phase flow through
T-junction cross-flow microfluidic device. A mathematical model based on a mass continuity, Navier-Stokes,
and level set equations are solved computationally using the Eulerian framework for Ca = 1e-4 - 1
and Qr =0.1 - 10. Both immiscible phases, having equal density and unequal viscosity, flow (Re=0.1)
through equal-sized channels. In particular, instantaneous phase flow field, droplet size, droplet
detachment time and generation frequency are presented and discussed as a function of governing
parameters (Ca and Qr). Considered parametric space is characterized as squeezing, first transition,
dripping, second transition, parallel, and jet flow regimes. In contrast to threshold Ca ~ 0.01
in earlier studies, squeezing regime exists for all Ca and Qr = 2- 10. Flow regimes are also mapped
into droplets and non-droplet zones. Threshold interfacial Ca, defining the boundary between
droplet and non-droplet zones, scales quadratically with Qr. Droplet dynamics shows a complex
dependence on Ca and Qr. Droplet length varies linearly with Qr in squeezing regime whereas power-law
variation with Ca and Qr in dripping regime. Droplet frequency shows a power-law function of Ca and
Qr in droplet zone. Present results compare excellently with earlier limited experimental and
numerical studies. Finally, present results and predictive correlations can guide engineering
and design of droplet microfluidics devices.

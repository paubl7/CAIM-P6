The effective use of swift ion beams in cancer treatment (known as hadrontherapy) as well as an appropriate
protection in manned space missions rely on the accurate understanding of energy delivery to cells
damaging their genetic information. The key ingredient characterizing the response of a medium
to the perturbation induced by charged particles is its electronic excitation spectrum. By using
linear response time-dependent density functional theory, we obtain the energy and momentum transfer
excitation spectrum (the energy-loss function, ELF) of liquid water (main constituent of biological
tissues), in excellent agreement with experimental data. The inelastic scattering cross sections
obtained from this ELF, together with the elastic scattering cross sections derived considering
the condensed phase nature of the medium, are used to perform accurate Monte Carlo simulations of
the energy deposited by swift carbon ions in liquid water and carried away by the generated secondary
electrons producing inelastic events (ionization, excitation, and dissociation electron attachment,
DEA), strongly correlated with cellular death, which are scored in sensitive volumes having the
size of two DNA convolutions. The sizes of clusters of damaging events for a wide range of carbon ion
energies, from those relevant to hadrontherapy up to cosmic radiation, predict with unprecedented
statistical accuracy the nature and relative magnitude of the main inelastic processes contributing
to radiation biodamage, confirming that ionization accounts for the vast majority of complex damage.
DEA, typically regarded as a very relevant biodamage mechanism, surprisingly plays a minor role
in carbon-ion induced clusters of harmful events.

We investigate relationships between statistics obtained from filtering and from ensemble or
Reynolds-averaging turbulence flow fields as a function of length scale. Generalized central
moments in the filtering approach are expressed as inner products of generalized fluctuating quantities,
$q'(\xi,x)=q(\xi)-\overline q(x)$, representing fluctuations of a field $q(\xi)$, at any point
$\xi$, with respect to its filtered value at $x$. For positive-definite filter kernels, these expressions
provide a scale-resolving framework, with statistics and realizability conditions at any length
scale. In the small-scale limit, scale-resolving statistics become zero. In the large-scale limit,
scale-resolving statistics and realizability conditions are the same as in the Reynolds-averaged
description. Using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of homogeneous variable density turbulence,
we diagnose Reynolds stresses, $\mathcal{T}_{ij}$, resolved kinetic energy, $k_r$, turbulent
mass-flux velocity, $a_i$, and density-specific volume covariance, $b$, defined in the scale-resolving
framework. These variables, and terms in their governing equations, vary smoothly between zero
and their Reynolds-averaged definitions at the small and large scale limits, respectively. At
intermediate scales, the governing equations exhibit interactions between terms that are not
active in the Reynolds-averaged limit. For example, in the Reynolds-averaged limit, $b$ follows
a decaying process driven by a destruction term; at intermediate length scales it is a balance between
production, redistribution, destruction, and transport, where $b$ grows as the density spectrum
develops, and then decays when mixing becomes strong enough. This work supports the notion of a generalized,
length-scale adaptive model that converges to DNS at high resolutions, and to Reynolds-averaged
statistics at coarse resolutions.

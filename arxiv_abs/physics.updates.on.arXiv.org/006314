The fundamental interaction between free electrons and photons stands at the base of both classical
and quantum physics. In classical physics, this interaction has recently found renewed interest
in the fields of free-electron acceleration and radiation sources. In quantum physics, this interaction
has recently facilitated shaping the wavefunction of a single electron in time and space, giving
rise to coherent attosecond single-electron combs. Yet, to this day -- in all experiments involving
the interaction between free electrons and light -- the light was considered as a classical wave,
disregarding its quantum nature. Here, we observe the effect of the quantum statistics of photons
on free-electron interactions with light. We demonstrate interactions passing continuously
from Poissonian to super-Poissonian and up to thermal statistics, unveiling a surprising manifestation
of Bohr's Correspondence Principle: the continuous transition from quantum walk to classical
random walk of a free electron on the energy ladder. The electron walker serves as the probe in non-destructive
quantum detection experiments, measuring the photon statistics as well as degrees of coherence
${g^{(2)} (0)}$ and higher-orders ${g^{(n)} (0)}$. Unlike conventional quantum-optical detectors,
the electron can perform both quantum weak measurements and projective measurements of light by
evolving into an entangled joint-state with the photons. Our findings suggest hitherto inaccessible
concepts in quantum optics: free-electron-based non-destructive quantum tomography of light,
even with ultrafast modulation of the photon statistics or the field quadratures. The study of high-efficiency
electron-light coupling constitutes an important step towards combined attosecond-temporal
and sub-{\AA}-spatial resolution microscopy.

We present high resolution thermal expansion measurement data obtained with high relative sensitivity
of $\Delta$L$/$L = 10$^{-9}$ and accuracy of $\pm$2$\%$ using closed cycle refrigerators employing
two different dilatometers. The data quality is in excellent agreement with those obtained using
wet liquid helium based systems, demonstrating great technological possibilities for future
thermal expansion measurements in view of the depleting resource of liquid helium. The cryogenic
environment was achieved using two different cryostats that use pulse tube and Gifford-Mcmahon
coolers as the cryocoolers. Both the dilatometers employ a spring movement for achieving the parallel
movement of the capacitor plates. $Dilatometer \#1$ was built in-house based on a published design
while $dilatometer \#2$ was obtained commercially. Cell calibration for $dilatometer \#1$ was
done using copper and minimal deviation of the cell effect from the published values were found.
Linear thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$ obtained using both dilatometers was evaluated
using two different techniques, namely, numerical differentiation and derivative of a polynomial
fit. The resultant $\alpha$ obtained for metals silver and aluminium showed excellent match with
published values obtained on systems using wet cryostats. Finite element method simulations were
performed for understanding the spring movement in each dilatometer using which the effect of different
forces$/$pressures on the displacement of the spring was studied. Finally, we report thermal expansion
measurements done on single crystals of two high temperature superconductors YBa$_2$Cu$_{3-x}$Al$_x$O$_{6+\delta}$
and Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ along the c-axis and found very good match with published data
obtained using wet liquid helium based cryostats.

Linear instability of high-speed boundary layers is routinely examined assuming quiescent edge
conditions, without reference to the internal structure of shocks or to instabilities potentially
generated in them. Our recent work has shown that the kinetically modeled internal nonequilibrium
zone of straight shocks away from solid boundaries exhibits low-frequency molecular fluctuations.
The presence of the dominant low frequencies observed using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
method has been explained as a consequence of the well-known bimodal probability density function
(PDF) of the energy of particles inside a shock. Here, PDFs of particle energies are derived in the
upstream and downstream equilibrium regions, as well as inside shocks, and it is shown for the first
time that they have the form of the non-central chi-squared (NCCS) distributions. A linear correlation
is proposed to relate the change in the shape of the analytical PDFs as a function of Mach number, within
the range $3 \le M \le 10$, with the DSMC-derived average characteristic low-frequency of shocks,
as computed in our earlier work. At a given Mach number $M=7.2$, varying the input translational
temperature in the range $89 \le T_{tr,1}/(K) \le 1420$, it is shown that the variation in DSMC-derived
low-frequencies is correlated with the change in most-probable-speed inside shocks at the location
of maximum bulk velocity gradient. Using the proposed linear functions, average low-frequencies
are estimated within the examined ranges of Mach number and input temperature and a semi-empirical
relationship is derived to predict low-frequency oscillations in shocks. Our model can be used
to provide realistic physics-based boundary conditions in receptivity and linear stability analysis
studies of laminar-turbulent transition in high-speed flows.

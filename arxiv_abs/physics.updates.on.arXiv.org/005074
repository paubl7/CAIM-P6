We study in detail the electromagnetic fields and the Poynting flux in the case of a uniformly accelerated
charge, in order to examine whether such a charge does `emit' radiation, especially in view of the
widely accepted fact that there is no radiation reaction on the charge. Our concern, in particular,
is with the Poynting flow computed at large distances (approaching infinity!) from the time-retarded
positions of uniformly accelerated charge, and taken as an evidence of radiation emitted by the
charge, which we shall demonstrate to be not true. As the charge picks up speed due to a constant acceleration,
the energy in its self-fields accordingly increases and the Poynting flow, usually inferred as
radiation, actually forms part of the requisite energy being fed into fields, at a rate just sufficient
to match the increasing energy in its self-fields at various distances from the uniformly accelerated
charge, including that in the far-off regions. In fact, for the decelerating charge, the energy
in its self-fields decreases, at all distances from the charge, till it comes to momentary rest with
no energy in its transverse fields, and this decrease in energy is shown {\em everywhere} by an inward
radial flow of the Poynting vector, toward the `present' position of the decelerating charge. Moreover,
there is a convective flow of self-fields of the charge, seen as a Poynting flow component always
along the `present' direction of motion of the charge. Further, we shall show that effectively the
electromagnetic fields, including the acceleration fields, even when they are at large distances
from the time-retarded position of the charge, they continue to be all around the `present' position
of the charge which itself is moving toward infinity due to the uniform acceleration.

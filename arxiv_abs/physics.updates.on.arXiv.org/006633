Fault zones are associated with multi-scale heterogeneities of rock properties. Large scale variations
may be imaged with conventional seismic reflection methods that detect offsets in geological units,
and tomographic techniques that provide average seismic velocities in resolved volumes. However,
characterizing elementary localized inhomogeneities of fault zones, such as cracks and fractures,
constitutes a challenge for conventional techniques. Resolving these small-scale heterogeneities
can provide detailed information for structural and mechanical models of fault zones. Recently,
the reflection matrix approach utilizing body wave reflections in ambient noise cross-correlations
was extended with the introduction of aberration corrections to handle the actual lateral velocity
variations in the fault zone [Touma et al., Geophys. J. Int. 226, 780-794, 2021]. Here this method
is applied further to analyze the distribution of scatterers in the first few kilometers of the crust
in the San Jacinto Fault Zone at the Sage Brush Flat (SGB) site, southeast of Anza, California. The
matrix approach allows us to image not only specular reflectors but also to resolve the presence,
location and intensity of scatterers of seismic waves starting with a simple homogeneous background
velocity model of the medium. The derived three-dimensional image of the fault zone resolves lateral
variations of scattering properties in the region within and around the surface fault traces, as
well as differences between the Northwest (NW) and the Southeast (SE) parts of the study area. A localized
intense damage zone at depth is observed in the SE section, suggesting that a geometrical complexity
of the fault zone at depth induces ongoing generation of rock damage.

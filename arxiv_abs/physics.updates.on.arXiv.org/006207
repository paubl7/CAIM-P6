The reduction and control of particulate matter generated by fossil fuel combustion are among the
main issues for actual and future combustion devices due to the increasingly stringent emission
regulations. Recently, various fuels have been investigated as a potential substitute or additive
for diesel and gasoline. This work focuses on how oxymethylene ether-3 (OME3), the smallest promising
OME compound, affects carbon particulate formation when blended with ethylene in burner-stabilized
premixed flames at different equivalence ratios. Particle size distribution (PSD) and Laser Induced
Fluorescence (LIF) and Incandescence (LII) along with numerical (Conditional Quadrature Method
of Moments - CQMOM, based on D'Anna physico-chemical soot model) investigations were conducted
to study particle formation and growth in pure ethylene and ethylene/OME3 flames. The soot volume
fraction and PSD indicate a reduction in the total number and the size of the soot particles at all
equivalence ratios, while the number of small nanoparticles remains almost unchanged. The CQMOM
model is able to predict similar trends for the soot volume fraction and, using the entropy maximization
concept, the general shape of the PSD for both pure ethylene and OME3-blended flames, compared to
the experimental measurements. Further, carbon particulate matter was thermophoretically sampled
in the highest equivalence ratio conditions and spectroscopically analyzed. The soot structure
was investigated using UV-Visible and Raman spectroscopy, finding a slightly higher aromaticity
for the pure ethylene soot. FTIR analysis showed that carbon particulate matter produced from an
OME3-doped flame contained larger amounts of oxygen, mainly in the form of C=O.

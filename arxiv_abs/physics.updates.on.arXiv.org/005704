Characterization of the long-time behavior of an inviscid incompressible fluid evolving on a two-dimensional
domain is a long-standing problem in physics. The motion is described by Euler's equations: a non-linear
system with infinitely many conservations laws, yet non-integrable dynamics. In both experiments
and numerical simulations, coherent vortex structures, or blobs, typically form after some stage
of initial mixing. These formations dominate the slow, large-scale dynamics. Nevertheless, fast,
small-scale dynamics also persist. Kraichnan, in his classical work, qualitatively describes
a direct cascade of enstrophy into smaller scales and a backward cascade of energy into larger scales.
Previous attempts to quantitatively model this double cascade are based on filtering-like techniques
that enforce separation from the outset. Here we show that Euler's equations possess a natural,
intrinsic splitting of the vorticity function. This canonical splitting is remarkable in four
ways: (i) it is defined only in terms of the Poisson bracket and the Hamiltonian, (ii) it characterizes
steady flows (equilibria), (iii) it genuinely, without imposition, evolves into a separation
of scales, thus enabling the quantitative dynamics behind Kraichnan's qualitative description,
and (iv) it accounts for the "broken line" in the power law for the energy spectrum (observed in both
experiments and numerical simulations). The splitting originates from a quantized version of
Euler's equations in combination with a standard quantum-tool: the spectral decomposition of
Hermitian matrices. In addition to theoretical insight, the canonical scale separation dynamics
might be used as a foundation for stochastic model reduction, where the small scales are modelled
by suitable multiplicative noise.

In multiscale modelling, multiple models are used simultaneously to describe scale-dependent
phenomena in a system of interest. Here we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based multiscale modelling
framework for modelling hierarchical multiscale problems. In these problems, closure relations
are required for the macroscopic problem in the form of constitutive relations. However, forming
explicit closures for nonlinear and hysteretic processes remains challenging. Instead, we provide
a framework for learning constitutive mappings given microscale data generated according to micro
and macro transitions governed by two-scale homogenisation rules. The resulting data-driven
model is then coupled to a macroscale simulator leading to a hybrid ML-physics-based modelling
approach. Accordingly, we apply the multiscale framework within the context of transient phenomena
in dual-porosity geomaterials. In these materials, the inter-porosity flow is a complex time-dependent
function making its adoption within flow simulators challenging. We explore nonlinear feedforward
autoregressive ML strategies for the constitutive modelling of this sequential problem. We demonstrate
how to inject the resulting surrogate constitutive model into a simulator. We then compare the resulting
hybrid approach to traditional dual-porosity and microscale models on a variety of tests. We show
the hybrid approach to give high-quality results with respect to explicit microscale simulations
without the computational burden of the latter. Lastly, the steps provided by the multiscale framework
herein are sufficiently general to be applied to a variety of multiscale settings, using different
data generation and learning techniques accordingly.

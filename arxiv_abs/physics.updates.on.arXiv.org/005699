The complexity of financial markets arise from the strategic interactions among agents trading
stocks, which manifest in the form of vibrant correlation patterns among stock prices. Over the
past few decades, complex financial markets have often been represented as networks whose interacting
pairs of nodes are stocks, connected by edges that signify the correlation strengths. However,
we often have interactions that occur in groups of three or more nodes, and these cannot be described
simply by pairwise interactions but we also need to take the relations between these interactions
into account. Only recently, researchers have started devoting attention to the higher-order
architecture of complex financial systems, that can significantly enhance our ability to estimate
systemic risk as well as measure the robustness of financial systems in terms of market efficiency.
Geometry-inspired network measures, such as the Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Forman-Ricci curvature,
can be used to capture the network fragility and continuously monitor financial dynamics. Here,
we explore the utility of such discrete Ricci curvatures in characterizing the structure of financial
systems, and further, evaluate them as generic indicators of the market instability. For this purpose,
we examine the daily returns from a set of stocks comprising the USA S&P-500 and the Japanese Nikkei-225
over a 32-year period, and monitor the changes in the edge-centric network curvatures. We find that
the different geometric measures capture well the system-level features of the market and hence
we can distinguish between the normal or `business-as-usual' periods and all the major market crashes.
This can be very useful in strategic designing of financial systems and regulating the markets in
order to tackle financial instabilities.

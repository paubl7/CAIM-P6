Quenching of limit cycle oscillations (LCO), either through mutual coupling or external forcing,
has attracted wide attention in several fields of science and engineering. However, the simultaneous
utilization of these coupling schemes in quenching of LCO has rarely been studied despite its practical
applicability. We study the dynamics of two thermoacoustic oscillators simultaneously subjected
to mutual coupling and asymmetric external forcing through experiments and theoretical modeling.
We investigate the forced response of both identical and non-identical thermoacoustic oscillators
for two different amplitudes of LCO. Under mutual coupling alone, identical thermoacoustic oscillators
display the occurrence of partial amplitude death and amplitude death, whereas under forcing alone,
asynchronous quenching of LCO is observed at non-resonant conditions. When the oscillators are
simultaneously subjected to mutual coupling and asymmetric forcing, we observe a larger parametric
region of oscillation quenching than when the two mechanisms are utilized individually. This enhancement
in the region of oscillation quenching is due to the complementary effect of amplitude death and
asynchronous quenching. However, a forced response of coupled non-identical oscillators shows
that the effect of forcing is insignificant on synchronization and quenching of oscillations in
the oscillator which is not directly forced. Finally, we qualitatively capture the experimental
results using a reduced-order theoretical model of two coupled Rijke tubes which are coupled through
dissipative and time-delay coupling and asymmetrically forced. We believe that these findings
offer fresh insights into the combined effects of mutual and forced synchronization in a system
of coupled nonlinear oscillators.

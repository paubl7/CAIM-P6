Achieving accurate numerical results of hydrodynamic loads based on the potential-flow theory
is very challenging for structures with sharp edges, due to the singular behavior of the local-flow
velocities. In this paper, we introduce the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) to solve fluid-structure
interaction problems involving sharp edges on structures. Four different FEM solvers, including
conventional linear and quadratic FEMs as well as their corresponding XFEM versions with local
enrichment by singular basis functions at sharp edges, are implemented and compared. To demonstrate
the accuracy and efficiency of the XFEMs, a thin flat plate in an infinite fluid domain and a forced
heaving rectangle at the free surface, both in two dimensions, will be studied. For the flat plate,
the mesh convergence studies are carried out for both the velocity potential in the fluid domain
and the added mass, and the XFEMs show apparent advantages thanks to their local enhancement at the
sharp edges. Three different enrichment strategies are also compared, and suggestions will be
made for the practical implementation of the XFEM. For the forced heaving rectangle, the linear
and 2nd order mean wave loads are studied. Our results confirm the previous conclusion in the literature
that it is not difficult for a conventional numerical model to obtain convergent results for added
mass and damping coefficients. However, when the 2nd order mean wave loads requiring the computation
of velocity components are calculated via direct pressure integration, it takes a tremendously
large number of elements for the conventional FEMs to get convergent results. On the contrary, the
numerical results of XFEMs converge rapidly even with very coarse meshes, especially for the quadratic
XFEM.

The linear instability of a surfactant-laden two-layer falling film over an inclined slippery
wall is analyzed under an influence of external shear which is imposed on the top surface of the flow.
The free surface of the flow as well as the interface among the fluids are contaminated by insoluble
surfactants. Dynamics of both the layers are governed by the Navier--Stokes equations, and the
surfactant transport equation regulates the motion of the insoluble surfactants at the interface
and free surface. Instability mechanisms are compared by imposing the external shear along and
opposite to the flow direction. A coupled Orr--Sommerfeld system of equations for the considered
problem is derived using the perturbation technique and normal mode analysis. The eigenmodes corresponding
to the Orr--Sommerfeld eigenvalue problem are obtained by employing the spectral collocation
method. The numerical results imply that the stronger external shear destabilizes the interface
mode instability. However, a stabilizing impact of the external shear on the surface mode is noticed
if the shear is imposed in the flow direction, which is in contrast to the role of imposed external
shear on the surface mode for a surfactant laden single layer falling film. Moreover, the impression
of shear mode on the primary instability is analyzed in the high Reynolds number regime with sufficiently
low inclination angle. Under such configuration, dominance of the shear mode over the surface mode
is observed due to the weaker impact of the gravitation force on the surface instability. The shear
mode can also be stabilized by applying the external shear in the counter direction of the streamwise
flow. Conclusively, the extra imposed shear on the stratified two-layer falling film plays an active
role to control the attitude of the instabilities.

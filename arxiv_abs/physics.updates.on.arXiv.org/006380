This paper introduces a new time-frequency representation method for biomedical signals: the
dyadic aggregated autoregressive (DASAR) model. Signals, such as electroencephalograms (EEGs)
and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), exhibit physiological information through
time-evolving spectrum components at specific frequency intervals: 0-50 Hz (EEG) or 0-150 mHz
(fNIRS). Spectrotemporal features in signals are conventionally estimated using short-time
Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform (WT). However, both methods may not offer the most
robust or compact representation despite their widespread use in biomedical contexts. The presented
method, DASAR, improves precise frequency identification and tracking of interpretable frequency
components with a parsimonious set of parameters. DASAR achieves these characteristics by assuming
that the biomedical time-varying spectrum comprises several independent stochastic oscillators
with (piecewise) time-varying frequencies. Local stationarity can be assumed within dyadic subdivisions
of the recordings, while the stochastic oscillators can be modeled with an aggregation of second-order
autoregressive models (ASAR). DASAR can provide a more accurate representation of the (highly
contrasted) EEG and fNIRS frequency ranges by increasing the estimation accuracy in user-defined
spectrum region of interest (SROI). A mental arithmetic experiment on a hybrid EEG-fNIRS was conducted
to assess the efficiency of the method. Our proposed technique, STFT, and WT were applied on both
biomedical signals to discover potential oscillators that improve the discrimination between
the task condition and its baseline. The results show that DASAR provided the highest spectrum differentiation
and it was the only method that could identify Mayer waves as narrow-band artifacts at 97.4-97.5
mHz.

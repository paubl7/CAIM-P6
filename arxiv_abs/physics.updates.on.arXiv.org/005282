Influences of reaction zone thickening and local extinctions on the burning rate of extremely turbulent
hydrogen-enriched methane-air flames are investigated using simultaneous planar laser-induced
fluorescence of formaldehyde molecule and hydroxyl radical as well as separate stereoscopic particle
image velocimetry techniques. Karlovitz numbers upto 76 are examined. It is shown that, by increasing
the turbulence intensity, the preheat and reaction zone thicknesses can increase to values that
are, respectively, 6.3 and 4.9 of the corresponding laminar flames. Broadening of these zones for
intensely turbulent hydrogen-enriched methane-air flames is shown experimentally for the first
time. Broadening of the reaction zone suggests that the flamelet assumption used for development
of the burning rate formulations may not hold. Thus, a new formulation, which does not utilize the
flamelet assumption, is developed and used to calculate the burning rate of the tested flames. It
is shown that, at small turbulence intensities, the burning rate values follow those of the local
consumption speed, which is developed in the literature based on the flamelet assumption. However,
at large turbulence intensities, the estimated burning rate features large values, and the ratio
of this parameter to the local consumption speed is consistent with the ratio of the global and local
consumption speeds reported in the literature. It is shown that the ratio of the normalized burning
rate to the normalized local consumption speed is correlated with the broadening of reaction zone,
suggesting that the disparity between the values of the burning rate and local consumption speed
is linked to the reaction zone thickening. It is shown, although the flame thickening increase the
burning rate, local extinctions decrease this parameter leading to the bending behavior reported
in the literature.

Here we propose a local earthquake tomography method that applies a structured regularization
technique to determine sharp changes in the Earth's seismic velocity structure with travel time
data of direct waves. Our approach focuses on the ability to better image two common features that
are observed the Earth's seismic velocity structure: velocity jumps that correspond to material
boundaries, such as the Conrad and Moho discontinuities, and gradual velocity changes that are
associated with the pressure and temperature distributions in the crust and mantle. We employ different
penalty terms in the vertical and horizontal directions to refine the imaging process. We utilize
a vertical-direction (depth) penalty term that takes the form of the l1-sum of the l2-norm of the
second-order differences of the horizontal units in the vertical direction. This penalty is intended
to represent sharp velocity jumps due to discontinuities by creating a piecewise linear depth profile
of the average velocity structure. We set a horizontal-direction penalty term on the basis of the
l2-norm to express gradual velocity tendencies in the horizontal direction. We use a synthetic
dataset to demonstrate that our method provides significant improvements over the estimated velocity
structures from conventional methods by obtaining stable estimates of both the velocity jumps
and gradual velocity changes. We also demonstrate that our proposed method is relatively robust
against variations in the amplitude of the velocity jump, initial velocity model, and the number
of observed travel times. Furthermore, we present a considerable potential for detecting a velocity
discontinuity using the observed travel times from only a small number of direct-wave observations.

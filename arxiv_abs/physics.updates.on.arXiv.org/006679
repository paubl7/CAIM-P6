Targeting sustainability in our industrial society requires integrating specific criteria in
the design process of products and processes. A paradigm shift is necessary in the economical, social
and political systems to ensure the natural ecosystems preservation on the planet while fulfilling
society needs. Various research methods have therefore emerged to change the way products and services
are designed, developed, used and discarded considering territorial contexts. Design for Sustainability,
Design for Sustainable Transition, Socially Responsible Design, post-growth design, etc. provide
several methods integrating the sustainable principles in the design process. However those approaches
remain mainly experimental and are limited to the industrial context. In parallel to those approaches
a wide variety of grassroots initiatives have emerged in territories. They propose alternative
ways to design systems and they integrate new constraints in a practical manner. This research therefore
aims to confront the diversity of Design to Environment (DtE) approaches with 'grassroots' initiatives
in order to understand the possible evolution of the integration of sustainability into the design
process of products and services used in industry. This paper presents the first literature review
results of a started project in 2020. An original research protocol is proposed in this paper, based
on specific focus groups with grassroots initiatives practitioners and eco-design experts from
research and industry. The presentation of four DtE frameworks are analysed in this paper. This
research finally discusses the opportunity of integrating the grassroots enriched DtE frameworks
by non-officialdesigners in life cycle engineering. This bottom-up process may drive an expression
of sustainability in industry aligned with some emerging local socio-technical systems.

Many different simulation methods for Stokes flow problems involve a common computationally intense
task---the summation of a kernel function over $O(N^2)$ pairs of points. One popular technique
is the Kernel Independent Fast Multipole Method (KIFMM), which constructs a spatial adaptive octree
and places a small number of equivalent multipole and local points around each octree box, and completes
the kernel sum with $O(N)$ performance. However, the KIFMM cannot be used directly with nonlinear
kernels, can be inefficient for complicated linear kernels, and in general is difficult to implement
compared to less-efficient alternatives such as Ewald-type methods. Here we present the Kernel
Aggregated Fast Multipole Method (KAFMM), which overcomes these drawbacks by allowing different
kernel functions to be used for specific stages of octree traversal. In many cases a simpler linear
kernel suffices during the most extensive stage of octree traversal, even for nonlinear kernel
summation problems. The KAFMM thereby improves computational efficiency in general and also allows
efficient evaluation of some nonlinear kernel functions such as the regularized Stokeslet. We
have implemented our method as an open-source software library STKFMM with support for Laplace
kernels, the Stokeslet, regularized Stokeslet, Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) tensor, and the
Stokes double-layer and traction operators. Open and periodic boundary conditions are supported
for all kernels, and the no-slip wall boundary condition is supported for the Stokeslet and RPY tensor.
The package is designed to be ready-to-use as well as being readily extensible to additional kernels.
Massive parallelism is supported with mixed OpenMP and MPI.

Societal transformations are necessary to address critical global challenges, such as mitigation
of anthropogenic climate change and reaching UN sustainable development goals. Recently, social
tipping processes have received increased attention, as they present a form of social change whereby
a small change can shift a sensitive social system into a qualitatively different state due to strongly
self-amplifying (mathematically positive) feedback mechanisms. Social tipping processes have
been suggested as key drivers of sustainability transitions emerging in the fields of technological
and energy systems, political mobilization, financial markets and sociocultural norms and behaviors.
Drawing from expert elicitation and comprehensive literature review, we develop a framework to
identify and characterize social tipping processes critical to facilitating rapid social transformations.
We find that social tipping processes are distinguishable from those of already more widely studied
climate and ecological tipping dynamics. In particular, we identify human agency, social-institutional
network structures, different spatial and temporal scales and increased complexity as key distinctive
features underlying social tipping processes. Building on these characteristics, we propose
a formal definition for social tipping processes and filtering criteria for those processes that
could be decisive for future trajectories to global sustainability in the Anthropocene. We illustrate
this definition with the European political system as an example of potential social tipping processes,
highlighting the potential role of the FridaysForFuture movement. Accordingly, this analytical
framework for social tipping processes can be utilized to illuminate mechanisms for necessary
transformative climate change mitigation policies and actions.

The flow of segregated bidisperse assemblies of particles is of major importance for geophysical
flows and bedload transport in particular. In the present paper, the mobility of bidisperse segregated
particle beds was studied with a coupled fluid discrete element method. Large particles were initially
placed above small ones and it was observed that, for the same flow conditions, the bedload transport
rate is higher in the bidisperse configuration than in the monodisperse one. Depending on the Shields
number and on the depth of the interface between small and large particles, different transport
phenomenologies are observed, ranging from no influence of the small particles to small particles
reaching the bed surface due to diffusive remixing. In cases where the small particles hardly mix
with the overlying large particles and for the range of studied size ratios ($r<4$), it is shown that
the increased mobility is not a bottom roughness effect, that would be due to the reduction of roughness
of the underlying small particles, but a granular flow effect. This effect is analyzed within the
framework of the $\mu(I)$ rheology and it is demonstrated that the buried small particles are more
mobile than larger particles and play the role of a "conveyor belt" for the large particles at the
surface. Based on rheological arguments, a simple predictive model is proposed for the additional
transport in the bidisperse case. It reproduces quantitatively the DEM results for a large range
of Shields numbers and for size ratios smaller than 4. The results of the model are used to identify
four different transport regimes of bidisperse mixtures, depending on the mechanism responsible
for the mobility of the small particles. A phenomenological map is proposed for bidisperse bedload
transport and, more generally, for any granular flow on an erodible bed.

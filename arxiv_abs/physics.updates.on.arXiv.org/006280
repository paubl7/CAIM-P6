By including a fraction of exact exchange (EXX), hybrid functionals reduce the self-interaction
error in semi-local density functional theory (DFT), and thereby furnish a more accurate and reliable
description of the electronic structure in systems throughout biology, chemistry, physics, and
materials science. However, the high computational cost associated with the evaluation of all
required EXX quantities has limited the applicability of hybrid DFT in the treatment of large molecules
and complex condensed-phase materials. To overcome this limitation, we have devised a linear-scaling
yet formally exact approach that utilizes a local representation of the occupied orbitals (e.g.,
maximally localized Wannier functions, MLWFs) to exploit the sparsity in the real-space evaluation
of the quantum mechanical exchange interaction in finite-gap systems. In this work, we present
a detailed description of the theoretical and algorithmic advances required to perform MLWF-based
ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of large-scale condensed-phase systems at the
hybrid DFT level. We provide a comprehensive description of the exx algorithm, which is currently
implemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO program and employs a hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization scheme
to efficiently utilize high-performance computing (HPC) resources. This is followed by a critical
assessment of the accuracy and parallel performance of this approach when performing AIMD simulations
of liquid water in the canonical ensemble. With access to HPC resources, we demonstrate that exx
enables hybrid DFT based AIMD simulations of condensed-phase systems containing 500-1000 atoms
with a walltime cost that is comparable to semi-local DFT. In doing so, exx takes us closer to routinely
performing AIMD simulations of large-scale condensed-phase systems for sufficiently long timescales
at the hybrid DFT level of theory.

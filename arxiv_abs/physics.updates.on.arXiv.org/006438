Mini-proteins and peptides manifest dynamic conformational fluctuation and involve mutual interconversion
among metastable states. A robust mapping of the conformational landscape underlying mini-proteins
and peptides often requires low-dimensional projection of the conformational ensemble along
optimized collective variables. However, the traditional choice for the collective variable
(CV) is often limited by user-intuition and prior knowledge about the system, which lacks a rigorous
assessment of their optimality over other candidate CVs. To address this issue, we propose a generic
approach in which we first choose the possible combinations of inter-residue Calpha-distances
within a given macromolecule as a set of input CVs. Subsequently we derive a non-linear combination
of latent-space embedded collective variables via auto-encoding the unbiased MD simulation trajectories
within the framework of feed-forward neural network. We demonstrate the ability of the derived
latent space variables in elucidating the conformational landscape in three hierarchically complex
systems. When the conformational dynamics is resolved along the latent space CVs, it identifies
key metastable states of a bead-in-a-spring polymer. The combination of the adopted dimensionally
reduction technique with a Markov state model, built on the derived latent space, efficiently projects
the free energy landscape of GB1 beta-hairpin, revealing multiple spatially well-resolved and
kinetically well-separated metastable conformations. A quantitative comparison based on variational
approach to Markov Process of the auto encoder-derived latent-space CVs with the ones obtained
PCA or TICA confirms the optimality of the former. Finally, as a practical application, we demonstrate
that the auto-encoder derived CVs successfully predict the reinforced folding of Trp-cage mini-protein
in an aqueous osmolyte solution.

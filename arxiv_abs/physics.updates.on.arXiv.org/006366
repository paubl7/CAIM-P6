Studying the changed water dynamics in the hydration layers of biomolecules is an important step
towards fuller understanding of their function and mechanisms, but has shown to be quite difficult.
The measurement of the time-dependent Stokes shift of a chromophore attached to the biomolecule
is a promising method to achieve this goal, as published in J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 5 (2014), 1845, where
trehalose was used as biomolecule, 1-methyl-6-oxyquinolinium betaine as chromophore and water
as solvent. An overall retardation of solvent molecules is then obtained by comparison of the linked
system to the same system without trehalose, but contributions from different subgroups of solvent
molecules, for example molecules close to or far from trehalose, are unknown. The difficulty arising
from these unknown contributions of retarded and possibly unretarded solvent molecules is overcome
in this work by conducting computer simulations on this system and decomposing the overall signal
into contributions from various molecules at different locations. We performed non-equilibrium
molecular dynamics simulation using a polarizable water model and a non-polarizable solute model
and could reproduce the experimental time-dependent Stokes shift accurately for the linked trehalose-oxyquinolinium
and the pure oxyquinolinium over a wide temperature range, indicating the correctness of our employed
models. Decomposition of the shift into contributions from different solvent subgroups showed
that the amplitude of the measured shift is made up only half by the desired retarded solvent molecules
in the hydration layer, but to another half by unretarded bulk water, so that measured relaxation
times of the overall Stokes shift are only a lower boundary for the true relaxation times in the hydration
layer of trehalose.

Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) have gained increasing popularity over the years. Rooted
into statistical physics, the ERGMs framework has been successfully employed for reconstructing
networks, detecting statistically significant patterns in graphs, counting networked configurations
with given properties. From a technical point of view, the ERGMs workflow is defined by two subsequent
optimization steps: the first one concerns the maximization of Shannon entropy and leads to identify
the functional form of the ensemble probability distribution that is maximally non-committal
with respect to the missing information; the second one concerns the maximization of the likelihood
function induced by this probability distribution and leads to its numerical determination. This
second step translates into the resolution of a system of $O(N)$ non-linear, coupled equations
(with $N$ being the total number of nodes of the network under analysis), a problem that is affected
by three main issues, i.e. accuracy, speed and scalability. The present paper aims at addressing
these problems by comparing the performance of three algorithms (i.e. Newton's method, a quasi-Newton
method and a recently-proposed fixed-point recipe) in solving several ERGMs, defined by binary
and weighted constraints in both a directed and an undirected fashion. While Newton's method performs
best for relatively little networks, the fixed-point recipe is to be preferred when large configurations
are considered, as it ensures convergence to the solution within seconds for networks with hundreds
of thousands of nodes (e.g. the Internet, Bitcoin). We attach to the paper a Python code implementing
the three aforementioned algorithms on all the ERGMs considered in the present work.

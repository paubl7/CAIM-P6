The traveltime of compressional (P) and shear (S) waves have proven essential in many applications
of earthquake and exploration seismology. An accurate and efficient traveltime computation for
P and S waves is crucial for the success of these applications. However, solutions to the Eikonal
equation with a complex phase velocity field in anisotropic media is challenging. The Eikonal equation
is a first-order, hyperbolic, nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) that represents
the high-frequency asymptotic approximation of the wave equation. The fast marching and sweeping
methods are commonly used due to their efficiency in numercally solving Eikonal equation. However,
these methods suffer from numerical inaccuracy in anisotropic media with sharp heterogeneity,
irregular surface topography and complex phase velocity fields. This study presents a new method
to solving the Eikonal equation by employing the peridynamic differential operator (PDDO). The
PDDO provides the nonlocal form of the Eikonal equation by introducing an internal length parameter
(horizon) and a weight function with directional nonlocality. The operator is immune to discontinuities
in the form sharp changes in field or model variables and invokes the direction of traveltime in a
consistent manner. The weight function controls the degree of association among points within
the horizon. Solutions are constructed in a consistent manner without upwind assumptions through
simple discretization. The capability of this approach is demonstrated by considering different
types of Eikonal equations on complex velocity models in anisotropic media. The examples demonstrate
its unconditional numerical stability and results compare well with the reference solutions.

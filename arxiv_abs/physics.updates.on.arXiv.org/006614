Decision support systems like computer-aided energy system analysis (ESA) are considered one
of the main pillars for developing sustainable and reliable energy transformation strategies.
Although today's diverse tools can already support decision-makers in a variety of research questions,
further developments are still necessary. Intending to identify opportunities and challenges
in the field, we classify modelling capabilities (32), methodologies (15) implementation issues
(15) and management issues (7) from an extensive literature review. Based on a quantitative expert
survey of energy system modellers (N=61) mainly working with simulation and optimisation models,
the status of development and the complexity of realisation of those modelling topics are assessed.
While the rated items are considered to be more complex than actually represented, no significant
outliers are determinable, showing that there is no consensus about particular aspects of ESA that
are lacking development. Nevertheless, a classification of the items in terms of a specially defined
modelling strategy matrix identifies capabilities like land-use planning patterns, equity and
distributional effects and endogenous technological learning as "low hanging fruits" for enhancement,
as well as a large number of complex topics that are already well implemented. The remaining "tough
nuts" regarding modelling capabilities include non-energy sector and social behaviour interaction
effects. In general, the optimisation and simulation models differ in their respective strengths,
justifying the existence of both. While methods were generally rated as quite well developed, combinatorial
optimisation approaches, as well as machine learning, are identified as important research methods
to be developed further for ESA.

We perform interface-resolved simulations of finite-size evaporating droplets in weakly-compressible
homogeneous shear turbulence (HST). The study is conducted by varying three dimensionless physical
parameters: the initial gas temperature over the critical temperature $T_{g,0}/T_c$, the initial
droplet diameter over the Kolmogorov scale $d_0/\eta$ and the surface tension, i.e. the shear-based
Weber number, $We_{\mathcal{S}}$. For the smallest $We_{\mathcal{S}}$, we first discuss the
impact on the evaporation rate of the three thermodynamic models employed to evaluate the gas thermophysical
properties: a constant property model and two variable-properties approaches where either the
gas density or all the gas properties are allowed to vary. Taking this last approach as reference,
the model assuming constant gas properties and evaluated with the "1/3" rule, is shown to predict
the evaporation rate better than the model where the only variable property is the gas density. Moreover,
we observe that the well-known Fr\"ossling/Ranz-Marshall correlation underpredicts the Sherwood
number at low temperatures, $T_{g,0}/T_c=0.75$. Next, we show that the ratio between the actual
evaporation rate in turbulence and the one computed in stagnant condition is always much higher
than one for weakly deformable droplets: it decreases with $T_{g,0}/T_c$ without approaching
unity at the highest $T_{g,0}/T_c$ considered. This suggests an evaporation enhancement due to
turbulence also in conditions typical of combustion applications. Finally, we examine the overall
evaporation rate and the local interfacial mass-flux at higher $We_{\mathcal{S}}$, showing a
positive correlation between evaporation rate and interfacial curvature, especially at the lowest
$T_{g,0}/T_c$.

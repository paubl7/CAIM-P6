We report on the mobility and orientation of finite-size, neutrally buoyant prolate ellipsoids
(of aspect ratio $\Lambda=4$) in Taylor-Couette flow, using interface resolved numerical simulations.
The setup consists of a particle-laden flow in between a rotating inner and a stationary outer cylinder.
We simulate two particle sizes $\ell/d=0.1$ and $\ell/d=0.2$, $\ell$ denoting the particle major
axis and $d$ the gap-width between the cylinders. The volume fractions are $0.01\%$ and $0.07\%$,
respectively. The particles, which are initially randomly positioned, ultimately display characteristic
spatial distributions which can be categorised into four modes. Modes $(i)$ to $(iii)$ are observed
in the Taylor vortex flow regime, while mode ($iv$) encompasses both the wavy vortex, and turbulent
Taylor vortex flow regimes. Mode $(i)$ corresponds to stable orbits away from the vortex cores.
Remarkably, in a narrow $\textit{Ta}$ range, particles get trapped in the Taylor vortex cores (mode
($ii$)). Mode $(iii)$ is the transition when both modes $(i)$ and $(ii)$ are observed. For mode $(iv)$,
particles distribute throughout the domain due to flow instabilities. All four modes show characteristic
orientational statistics. We find the particle clustering for mode ($ii$) to be size-dependent,
with two main observations. Firstly, particle agglomeration at the core is much higher for $\ell/d=0.2$
compared to $\ell/d=0.1$. Secondly, the $\textit{Ta}$ range for which clustering is observed
depends on the particle size. For this mode $(ii)$ we observe particles to align strongly with the
local cylinder tangent. The most pronounced particle alignment is observed for $\ell/d=0.2$ around
$\textit{Ta}=4.2\times10^5$. This observation is found to closely correspond to a minimum of
axial vorticity at the Taylor vortex core ($\textit{Ta}=6\times10^5$) and we explain why.

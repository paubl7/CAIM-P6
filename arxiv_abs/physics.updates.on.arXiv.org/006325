We consider a biological network of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). The DG is a pre-processor
for pattern separation which facilitates pattern storage and retrieval in the CA3 area of the hippocampus.
The main encoding cells in the DG are the granule cells (GCs) which receive the input from the entorhinal
cortex (EC) and send their output to the CA3. The activation degree of GCs is so low (~ 5%). This sparsity
has been thought to enhance the pattern separation. We investigate the dynamical origin for winner-take-all
(WTA) competition which leads to sparse activation of the GCs. The whole GCs are grouped into lamellar
clusters. In each GC cluster, there is one inhibitory (I) basket cell (BC) along with excitatory
(E) GCs. There are three kinds of external inputs into the GCs; the direct excitatory EC input, the
indirect inhibitory EC input, mediated by the HIPP (hilar perforant path-associated) cells, and
the excitatory input from the hilar mossy cells (MCs). The firing activities of the GCs are determined
via competition between the external E and I inputs. The E-I conductance ratio ${\cal{R}}_{\rm
E-I}^{\rm (con)*}$ (given by the time average of the external E to I conductances) may represents
well the degree of such external E-I input competition. GCs become active when their $\cal{R}_{\rm
E-I}^{\rm (con)*}$ is larger than a threshold ${\cal{R}}_{th}^*$, and then the mean firing rates
of the active GCs are strongly correlated with $\cal{R}_{\rm E-I}^{\rm (con)*}$. In each GC cluster,
the feedback inhibition of the BC may select the winner GCs. GCs with larger $\cal{R}_{\rm E-I}^{\rm
(con)*}$ than the threshold ${\cal{R}}_{th}^*$ survive, and they become winners; all the other
GCs with smaller $\cal{R}_{\rm E-I}^{\rm (con)*}$ become silent. The WTA competition occurs via
competition between the firing activity of the GCs and the feedback inhibition from the BC in each
GC cluster.

In heliospheric plasmas the transport of energy and particles is governed by various fluxes (e.g.,
heat flux) triggered by different forces, electromagnetic fields, and gradients in density or
temperature. In the outer corona and at relatively low heliocentric distances in the solar wind
(i.e., < 1 AU), particle-particle collisions play an important role in the transport of energy,
momentum, and matter, described within classical transport theory by the transport coefficients,
which relate the fluxes to their sources. The present paper aims to improve the evaluation of the
main transport coefficients in such nonequilibrium plasmas, on the basis of an implicit realistic
characterization of their particle velocity distributions, in accord with the in situ observations.
Of particular interest is the presence of suprathermal populations and their influence on these
transport coefficients. Using the Boltzmann transport equation and macroscopic laws for the energy
and particle fluxes, we derived electric conductivity, thermoelectric coefficient, thermal
conductivity, diffusion, and mobility coefficient. These are conditioned by the electrons, which
are empirically well described by the Kappa distribution, with a nearly Maxwellian core and power-law
tails enhanced by the suprathermal population. Here we have adopted the original Kappa approach
that has the ability to outline and quantify the contribution of suprathermal populations. Without
exception, the transport coefficients are found to be systematically and markedly enhanced in
the presence of suprathermal electrons, due to the additional kinetic energy with which these populations
contribute to the dynamics of space plasma systems. The present results also show how important
an adequate Kappa modeling of suprathermal populations is, which is in contrast to other modified
interpretations that underestimate the effects of these populations.

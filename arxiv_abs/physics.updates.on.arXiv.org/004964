Renewed interest in Very Low Earth Orbits (VLEO) - i.e. altitudes below 450 km - has led to an increased
demand for accurate environment characterisation and aerodynamic force prediction. While the
former requires knowledge of the mechanisms that drive density variations in the thermosphere,
the latter also depends on the interactions between the gas-particles in the residual atmosphere
and the surfaces exposed to the flow. The determination of the aerodynamic coefficients is hindered
by the numerous uncertainties that characterise the physical processes occurring at the exposed
surfaces. Several models have been produced over the last 60 years with the intent of combining accuracy
with relatively simple implementations. In this paper the most popular models have been selected
and reviewed using as discriminating factors relevance with regards to orbital aerodynamics applications
and theoretical agreement with gas-beam experimental data. More sophisticated models were neglected,
since their increased accuracy is generally accompanied by a substantial increase in computation
times which is likely to be unsuitable for most space engineering applications. For the sake of clarity,
a distinction was introduced between physical and scattering kernel theory based gas-surface
interaction models. The physical model category comprises the Hard Cube model, the Soft Cube model
and the Washboard model, while the scattering kernel family consists of the Maxwell model, the Nocilla-Hurlbut-Sherman
model and the Cercignani-Lampis-Lord model. Limits and assets of each model have been discussed
with regards to the context of this paper. Wherever possible, comments have been provided to help
the reader to identify possible future challenges for gas-surface interaction science with regards
to orbital aerodynamic applications.

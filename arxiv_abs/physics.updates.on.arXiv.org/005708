The quiet solar corona consists of myriads of loop-like features, with magnetic fields originating
from network and internetwork regions on the solar surface. The continuous interaction between
these different magnetic patches leads to transient brightenings or bursts that might contribute
to the heating of the solar atmosphere. However, it remains unclear whether such transients, which
are mostly observed in the EUV, play a significant role in atmospheric heating. We revisit the open
question of these bursts as a prelude to the new high-resolution EUV imagery expected from the recently
launched Solar Orbiter. We use EUV images recorded by the SDO/AIA to investigate statistical properties
of the bursts. We detect the bursts in the 171 {\AA} filter images of AIA in an automated way through
a pixel-wise analysis by imposing different intensity thresholds. By exploiting the high cadence
(12 s) of the AIA observations, we find that the distribution of lifetimes of these events peaks at
about 120 s. The sizes of the detected bursts are limited by the spatial resolution, which indicates
that a larger number of events might be hidden in the AIA data. We estimate that about 100 new bursts
appear per second on the whole Sun. The detected bursts have nanoflare-like energies of $10^{24}$\,erg
per event. Based on this, we estimate that at least 100 times more events of a similar nature would
be required to account for the energy that is required to heat the corona. When AIA observations are
considered alone, the EUV bursts discussed here therefore play no significant role in the coronal
heating of the quiet Sun. If the coronal heating of the quiet Sun is mainly bursty, then the high-resolution
EUV observations from Solar Orbiter may be able to reduce the deficit in the number of EUV bursts seen
with SDO/AIA at least partly by detecting more such events.

In this work, we use a combination of formal upscaling and data-driven machine learning for explicitly
closing a nonlinear transport and reaction process in a multiscale tissue. The classical effectiveness
factor model is used to formulate the macroscale reaction kinetics. We train a multilayer perceptron
network using training data generated by direct numerical simulations over microscale examples.
Once trained, the network is used for numerically solving the upscaled (coarse-grained) differential
equation describing mass transport and reaction in two example tissues. The network is described
as being explicit in the sense that the network is trained using macroscale concentrations and gradients
of concentration as components of the feature space. Network training and solutions to the macroscale
transport equations were computed for two different tissues. The two tissue types (brain and liver)
exhibit markedly different geometrical complexity and spatial scale (cell size and sample size).
The upscaled solutions for the average concentration are compared with numerical solutions derived
from the microscale concentration fields by a posteriori averaging. There are two outcomes of this
work of particular note: 1) we find that the trained network exhibits good generalizability, and
it is able to predict the effectiveness factor with high fidelity for realistically-structured
tissues despite the significantly different scale and geometry of the two example tissue types;
and 2) the approach results in an upscaled PDE with an effectiveness factor that is predicted (implicitly)
via the trained neural network. This latter result emphasizes our purposeful connection between
conventional averaging methods with the use of machine learning for closure; this contrasts with
some machine learning methods for upscaling where the exact form of the macroscale equation remains
unknown.

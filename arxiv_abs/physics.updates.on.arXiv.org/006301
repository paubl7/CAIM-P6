Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the world's leading cause of mortality and the disease burden
is continually expanding as the population ages. Recently, the MR-INFORM randomised trial has
demonstrated that the management of patients with stable CAD can be guided by stress perfusion cardiovascular
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and it is non-inferior to the using the invasive reference standard
of fractional flow reserve. The benefits of using stress perfusion CMR include that it is non-invasive
and significantly reduces the number of unnecessary coronary revascularisations. As compared
to other ischaemia tests, it boasts a high spatial resolution and does not expose the patient to ionising
radiation. However, the main limitation of stress perfusion CMR is that the diagnostic accuracy
is highly dependent on the level of training of the operator, resulting in the test only being performed
routinely in experienced tertiary centres. The clinical translation of stress perfusion CMR would
be greatly aided by a fully automated, user-independent, quantitative evaluation of myocardial
blood flow. This thesis presents major steps towards this goal: robust motion correction, automated
image processing, reliable quantitative modelling, and thorough validation. The motion correction
scheme makes use of data decomposition techniques, such as robust principal component analysis,
to mitigate the difficulties in image registration caused by the dynamic contrast enhancement.
The motion corrected image series are input to a processing pipeline which leverages the recent
advances in image processing facilitated by deep learning. The pipeline utilises convolutional
neural networks to perform a series of computer vision tasks including myocardial segmentation
and right ventricular insertion point detection...

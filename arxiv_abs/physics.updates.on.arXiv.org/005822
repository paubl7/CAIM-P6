We report on the effects of electron collision and indirect ionization processes, occurring at
photoexcitation and electron kinetic energies well below 30 eV on the photoemission spectra of
liquid water. We show that the nascent photoelectron spectrum and, hence, the inferred electron
binding energy can only be accurately determined if electron energies are large enough that cross
sections for quasi-elastic scattering processes, such as vibrational excitation, are negligible.
Otherwise, quasi-elastic scattering leads to strong, down-to-few-meV kinetic energy scattering
losses from the direct photoelectron features, which manifest in severely distorted intrinsic
photoelectron peak shapes. The associated cross-over point from predominant (known) electronically
inelastic to quasi-elastic scattering seems to arise at surprisingly large electron kinetic energies,
of approximately 10-14 eV. Concomitantly, we present evidence for the onset of indirect, autoionization
phenomena (occurring via superexcited states) within a few eV of the primary and secondary ionization
thresholds. These processes are inferred to compete with the direct ionization channels and primarily
produce low-energy photoelectrons at photon and electron impact excitation energies below ~15
eV. Our results highlight that vibrational inelastic electron scattering processes and neutral
photoexcitation and autoionization channels become increasingly important when photon and electron
kinetic energies are decreased towards the ionization threshold. Correspondingly, we show that
for neat water and aqueous solutions, great care must be taken when quantitatively analyzing photoelectron
spectra measured too close to the ionization threshold. Such care is essential for both the accurate
determination of solvent and solute ionization energies as well as photoelectron branching ratios
and peak magnitudes.

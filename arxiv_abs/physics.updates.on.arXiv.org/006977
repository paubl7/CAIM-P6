The issue of the accuracy of wind speed/power forecasts is becoming more and more important as wind
power production continues to increase year after year. Having accurate forecasts for the energy
market clashes with intrinsic difficulties of wind forecasts due to, e.g., the coarse resolution
of Numerical Weather Prediction models. Accuracy goes along with the need of providing uncertainties
estimations associated to a given deterministic forecast. However, the same issue of accuracy
also arises for uncertainties estimations. Forecast calibration via a suitable set of observed
data has been proved to be the right answer to the need of forecast accuracy. Here, we perform a systematic
study of accuracy assessment of wind speed/power forecasts over Italy from the Ensemble Prediction
System (EPS) in use at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Our study
aims at identifying the best Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS)-based calibration, among
those proposed in the present study, for the whole wind ensemble statistics. The calibrations are
based on the use of past wind speed measurements collected by 69 SYNOP stations over Italy in the years
2018 and 2019. We will start by proposing a simple calibration for observation-driven forecasts
(based on persistence) then passing to more complex EMOS strategies (local and regionalized) applied
to the full EPS where the role of conditioning on suitable meteorological variables will turn out
to be the key ingredient for accuracy. Our proposed strategies are ordered into a hierarchy of complexity
and assessed in a comparative way. Finally, we will quantify the impact of (local and regionalized)
calibrated wind forecasts on the wind power forecasts finding results of interest for the renewable
energy market.

Stellar interiors are the seat of efficient transport of angular momentum all along their evolution.
Understanding the dependence of the turbulent transport triggered by the shear instabilities
due to the differential rotation in stellar radiation zones is mandatory. Indeed, it constitutes
one of the cornerstones of the rotational transport and mixing theory which is implemented in stellar
evolution codes to predict the rotational and chemical evolutions of stars. We investigate horizontal
shear instabilities in stellar radiation zones by considering the full Coriolis acceleration
with both the dimensionless horizontal component $\tilde{f}$ and the vertical component $f$.
We performed a linear stability analysis for a horizontal shear flow with a hyperbolic tangent profile,
both numerically and asymptotically using the WKBJ approximation. As in the traditional approximation,
we identified the inflectional and inertial instabilities. The inflectional instability is destabilized
as $\tilde{f}$ increases and its maximum growth rate increases significantly, while the thermal
diffusivity stabilizes the inflectional instability similarly to the traditional case. The inertial
instability is also strongly affected; for instance, the inertially unstable regime is extended
in the non-diffusive limit as $0<f<1+\tilde{f}^{2}/N^{2}$, where $N$ is the dimensionless Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a
frequency. More strikingly, in the high-thermal-diffusivity limit, it is always inertially unstable
at any colatitude $\theta$ except at the poles (i.e., $0^{\circ}<\theta<180^{\circ}$). Using
the asymptotic and numerical results, we propose a prescription for the effective turbulent viscosities
induced by the instabilities to be possibly used in stellar evolution models. The characteristic
time of this turbulence is short enough to redistribute efficiently angular momentum and mix chemicals
in the radiation zones.

Differential buoyancy surface sources in the ocean may induce a density-driven flow that joins
faster flow components to create a multi-scale, 3D flow. Potential temperature and salinity are
active tracers that determine the ocean's potential density: their distribution strongly affects
the density-driven component while the overall flow affects their distribution. We present a robust
framework that allows one to study the effects of a general 3D flow on a density-driven velocity component,
by constructing a modular observation-based 3D model of intermediate complexity. The model contains
an incompressible velocity that couples two advection-diffusion equations, for temperature
and salinity. Instead of solving the Navier-Stokes equations for the velocity, we consider a flow
composed of several temporally separated, spatially predetermined modes. One of these modes models
the density-driven flow: its spatial form describes the density-driven flow structure and its
strength is determined dynamically by average density differences. The other modes are completely
predetermined, consisting of any incompressible, possibly unsteady, 3D flow, e.g. as determined
by kinematic models, observations, or simulations. The model is a non-linear, weakly coupled system
of two non-local PDEs. We prove its well-posedness in the sense of Hadamard, and obtain rigorous
bounds regarding analytical solutions. The model's relevance to oceanic systems is demonstrated
by tuning the model to mimic the North Atlantic ocean's dynamics. In one limit the model recovers
a simplified oceanic box model and in another limit a kinematic model of oceanic chaotic advection,
suggesting it can be utilized to study spatially dependent feedback processes in the ocean.

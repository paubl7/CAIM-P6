We theoretically formulate and experimentally demonstrate the design of metagratings (MGs) composed
of periodic rectangular grooves in a metallic medium, intended for perfect anomalous reflection.
Using mode matching, a semianalytical scheme for analysis and synthesis of such MGs, containing
multiple, arbitrarily arranged, grooves per period, is derived. Following the typical MG design
approach, we use this formalism to identify the relevant Floquet-Bloch (FB) modes and conveniently
formulate constraints for suppression of spurious scattering, directly tying the structure's
geometrical degrees of freedom (DOFs) to the desired functionality. Solving this set of constraints,
in turn, yields a detailed fabrication-ready MG design, without any full-wave optimization. Besides
providing means to realize highly-efficient beam deflection with all-metallic formations, we
show that the rectangular (two-dimensional) groove configuration enables \emph{simultaneous}
manipulation of both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized fields,
unavailable to date with common, printed-circuit-board-based, microwave MGs. In addition, we
highlight a physical limitation on the TE-polarization performance, preventing the ability to
achieve perfect anomalous reflection in any desired angle. These capabilities are verified using
three MG prototypes, produced with standard computer numerical control (CNC) machines, demonstrating
both single- and dual-polarized control of multiple diffraction modes. These results enable the
use of MGs for a broader range of applications, where dual-polarized control is required, or all-metallic
devices are preferable (e.g., spaceborne systems or at high operating frequencies).

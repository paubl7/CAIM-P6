Fourier ptychography microscopy (FPM), sharing its roots with synthetic aperture technique and
phase retrieval method, is a recently developed computational microscopic super-resolution
technique. By turning on the light-emitting diode (LED) elements sequentially and acquiring the
corresponding images that contain different spatial frequencies, FPM can achieve a wide field-of-view
(FOV), high-spatial-resolution imaging, and phase recovery simultaneously. Conventional FPM
assumes that the sample is sufficiently thin and strictly in focus. Nevertheless, even for a relatively
thin sample, the non-planar distribution characteristics and the non-ideal position/posture
of the sample will cause all or part of FOV to be defocused. In this paper, we proposed a fast digital
refocusing and depth-of-field (DOF) extended FPM strategy by taking the advantages of image lateral
shift caused by sample defocusing and varied-angle illuminations. The lateral shift amount is
proportional to the defocus distance and the tangent of the illumination angle. Instead of searching
the optimal defocus distance in optimization strategy, which is time-consuming, the defocus distance
of each subregion of the sample can be precisely and quickly obtained by calculating the relative
lateral shift amounts corresponding to different oblique illuminations. And then, the digital
refocusing strategy rooting in the Fresnel propagator is integrated into the FPM framework to achieve
the high-resolution and phase information reconstruction for each part of the sample, which means
the DOF the FPM is effectively extended. The feasibility of the proposed method in fast digital refocusing
and FOV extending is verified in the actual experiments with the USAF chart and biological samples.

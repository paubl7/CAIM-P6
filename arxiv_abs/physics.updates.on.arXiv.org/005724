One of the most important aims of grain boundary modeling is to predict the evolution of a large collection
of grains in phenomena such as abnormal grain growth, coupled grain boundary motion, and recrystallization
that occur under extreme thermomechanical loads. A unified framework to study the coevolution
of grain boundaries with bulk plasticity has recently been developed by Admal et al. (2018), which
is based on modeling grain boundaries as continuum dislocations governed by an energy based on the
Kobayashi--Warren--Carter (KWC) model (Kobayashi et al., 1998, 2000). While the resulting unified
model demonstrates coupled grain boundary motion and polygonization (seen in recrystallization),
it is restricted to grain boundary energies of the Read--Shockley type, which applies only to small
misorientation angles. In addition, the implementation of the unified model using finite elements
inherits the computational challenges of the KWC model that originate from the singular diffusive
nature of its governing equations. The main goal of this study is to generalize the KWC functional
to grain boundary energies beyond the Read--Shockley-type that respect the bicrystallography
of grain boundaries. The computational challenges of the KWC model are addressed by developing
a thresholding method that relies on a primal dual algorithm and the fast marching method, resulting
in an O(NlogN) algorithm, where N is the number of grid points. We validate the model by demonstrating
the Herring angle relation, followed by a study of the grain microstructure evolution in a two-dimensional
face-centered cubic copper polycrystal with crystal symmetry-invariant grain boundary energy
data obtained from the lattice matching method of Runnels et al. (2016a,b).

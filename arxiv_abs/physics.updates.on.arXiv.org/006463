In atmospheric pressure capacitively coupled microplasma jets, Voltage Waveform Tailoring (VWT)
was demonstrated to provide ultimate control of the Electron Energy Distribution Function (EEDF),
which allows to enhance and adjust the generation of selected neutral species by controlling the
electron power absorption dynamics. However, at the fundamental level, the physical origin of
these effects of VWT remained unclear. Therefore, in this work, the electron power absorption dynamics
is investigated in a He/N$_2$ jet with a nitrogen concentration of 0.05\% driven by a valleys waveform
at a base frequency of 13.56 MHz for different numbers of harmonics using a self-consistent Particle
in Cell simulation coupled with a spatio-temporally resolved analysis of the electron power absorption
based on the momentum balance equation. Due to the local nature of the transport at atmospheric pressure,
ohmic power absorption is dominant. Increasing the number of harmonics, due to the peculiar shape
of the excitation waveform the sheath collapse at the grounded electrode is shortened relative
to the one at the powered electrode. As a consequence, and in order to ensure flux compensation of
electrons and positive ions at this electrode, a high current is driven through the discharge at
the time of this short sheath collapse. This current is driven by a high ohmic electric field. Close
to the grounded electrode, where the electron density is low and the electric field is high, electrons
are accelerated to high energies and strong ionization as well as the formation of a local electron
density maximum are observed. This electron density maximum leads to a local ambipolar electric
field that acts as an electric field reversal and accelerates electrons to even higher energies.
These effects are understood in detail to fundamentally explain the unique potential of VWT for
EEDF control in such plasmas.

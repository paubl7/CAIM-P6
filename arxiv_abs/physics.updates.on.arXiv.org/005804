At the beginning of the second half of the twentieth century, Proudman and Pearson (JFM,2(3), 1956,
pp.237-262) suggested that the functional form of the drag coefficient of a single sphere subjected
to uniform fluid flow consists of a series of logarithmic and power terms of the Reynolds number.\
In this paper, we will explore the validity of the above statement for Reynolds numbers up to $10^{6}$,
by using a symbolic regression machine learning method.\ The algorithm is trained by using available
experimental data, as well as data from a well-known correlation from the literature for $Re$ ranging
from $0.1$ to $2\times 10^5$.\ The symbolic regression method finds the following expression for
the drag coefficient $C_D = a+\frac{24}{Re}+f(\log(Re))$, where $Re$ is the Reynolds number,
and the constituents of $f(\log(Re))$ are integer powers of $\log(Re)$.\ Interestingly, the value
of $a$ resembles the value of $C_D$, at the point where the laminar separation point occurs.\ The
above expression can generalize (extrapolate) with acceptable accuracy compared with the experiments
and numerical simulations for $Re$ ranging between $10^{-4}$ to $10^6$.\ The derived equation
is the first in the literature that predicted the drag reduction at extremely high $Re$ due to the
transition from laminar to turbulent flow regime (drag crisis), without ever being exposed to data
from the critical flow regime. \ We did the same analysis for the problem of heat transfer under forced
convection around a sphere, and found that the logarithmic terms of $Re$ and Peclect number $Pe$
play an essential role in the variation of the Nusselt number $Nu$.\ The machine learning algorithm
independently found the asymptotic solution of Acrivos and Goddard (JFM, 23(2), pp.273-291).

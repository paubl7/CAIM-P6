Numerous early warning systems based on rainfall measurements have been designed over the last
decades to forecast the onset of rainfall-induced shallow landslides. However, their use over
large areas poses challenges due to uncertainties related with the interaction among various controlling
factors. We propose a hybrid stochastic-mechanical approach to quantify the role of the hydro-mechanical
factors influencing slope stability and rank their importance. The proposed methodology relies
on a physically-based model of landslide triggering, and a stochastic approach treating selected
model parameters as correlated aleatory variables. The features of the methodology are illustrated
by referencing data for Campania, an Italian region characterized by landslide-prone volcanic
deposits. Synthetic intensity-duration (ID) thresholds are computed through Monte Carlo simulations.
Several key variables are treated as aleatoric, constraining their statistical properties through
available measurements. The variabilities of topographic features (e.g., slope angle), physical
and hydrological properties (e.g., porosity, dry unit weight ${\gamma}_d$, and saturated hydraulic
conductivity, $K_s$), and pre-rainstorm suction is evaluated to inspect its role on the resulting
scatter of ID thresholds. We find that: i) $K_s$ is most significant for high-intensity storms;
ii) in steep slopes, changes in pressure head greatly reduce the timescale of landslide triggering,
making the system heavily reliant on initial conditions; iii) for events occurring at long failure
times (gentle slopes and/or low intensity storms), the significance of the evolving stress level
(through ${\gamma}_d$) is highest. The proposed approach can be translated to other regions, expanded
to encompass new aleatory variables, and combined with other hydro-mechanical triggering models.

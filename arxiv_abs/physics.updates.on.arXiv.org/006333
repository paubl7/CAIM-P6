The high computational cost of evaluating atomic interactions recently motivated the development
of computationally inexpensive kinetic models, which can be parametrized from MD simulations
of complex chemistry of thousands of species or other processes and accelerate the prediction of
the chemical evolution by up to four order of magnitude. Such models go beyond the commonly employed
potential energy surface fitting methods in that they are aimed purely at describing kinetic effects.
So far, such kinetic models utilize molecular descriptions of reactions and have been constrained
to only reproduce molecules previously observed in MD simulations. Therefore, these descriptions
fail to predict the reactivity of unobserved molecules, for example in the case of large molecules
or solids. Here we propose a new approach for the extraction of reaction mechanisms and reaction
rates from MD simulations, namely the use of atomic-level features. Using the complex chemical
network of hydrocarbon pyrolysis as example, it is demonstrated that kinetic models built using
atomic features are able to explore chemical reaction pathways never observed in the MD simulations
used to parametrize them. Atomic-level features are shown to construct reaction mechanisms and
estimate reaction rates of unknown molecular species from elementary atomic events. Through comparisons
of the model ability to extrapolate to longer simulation timescales and different chemical compositions
than the ones used for parameterization, it is demonstrated that kinetic models employing atomic
features retain the same level of accuracy and transferability as the use of features based on molecular
species, while being more compact and parametrized with less data. We also find that atomic features
can better describe the formation of large molecules enabling the simultaneous description of
small molecules and condensed phases.

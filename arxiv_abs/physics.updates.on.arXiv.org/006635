Import and export of fossil energy carriers are cornerstones of energy systems world-wide. If energy
systems are to become climate neutral and sustainable, fossil carriers need to be substituted with
carbon neutral alternatives or electrified if possible. We investigate synthetic chemical energy
carriers, hydrogen, methane, methanol, ammonia and Fischer-Tropsch fuels, produced using electricity
from renewable energy sourceses as fossil substitutes. Renewable energy sourceses potentials
are obtained from GIS-analysis and hourly resolved time-series are derived using reanalysis weather
data. We model the sourcing of feedstock chemicals, synthesis and transport along nine different
energy supply chains to Germany. and compare import options for seven locations around the world
against each other and with domestically sourced alternatives on the basis of their respective
cost per unit of hydrogen and energy delivered. We find that for each type of chemical energy carrier
an import option with lower costs compared to domestic production in Germany exists. The lowest
cost import options for energy and hydrogen are by hydrogen pipeline from Denmark, Spain and Western
Asia and North Africa at 40.6 to 46.8 EUR per MWh (LHV) (1.4 to 1.6 EUR per kg H2) in 2050 assuming 5% p.a.
capital cost. For complex energy carriers like methane, ammonia, methanol or Fischer-Tropsch
fuel, imports from Argentina by ship to Germany are attractive even compared to closer European
Union or Western Asia and North Africa exporters. For meeting hydrogen demand, direct hydrogen
imports are more attractive than indirect routes using methane, methanol or ammoniaimports and
subsequent decomposition to hydrogen because of high capital investment costs and energetic losses
of the indirect routes. We make our model and data available under open licenses for adaptation and
reuse.

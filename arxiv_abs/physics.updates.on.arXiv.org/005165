Compton-to-peak analysis is a method for selecting coefficients for converting count rates measured
with in situ gamma ray spectrometry to radioactivity concentrations of $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs
in the environment. Compton-to-peak analysis is based on the count rate ratio between the spectral
regions containing scattered gamma rays to the primary $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs photopeaks (known
as the Compton-to-peak ratio - RCP). RCP changes with the vertical distribution of $^{134}$Cs and
$^{137}$Cs within the ground. Inferring this distribution enables the selection of appropriate
count rate to activity concentration conversion coefficients. Here PHITS was used to simulate
the dependency of RCP on different vertical distributions of $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs within
the ground. A model was created of a LaBr$_3$(Ce) detector used in drone helicopter aerial surveys
in Fukushima Prefecture. The model was verified by comparing simulated gamma ray spectra to measurements
from test sources. Simulations were performed for the infinite half-space geometry to calculate
the dependency of RCP on the mass depth distribution (exponential or uniform) of $^{134}$Cs and
$^{137}$Cs within the ground, and on the altitude of the detector above the ground. The calculations
suggest that the sensitivity of the Compton-to-peak method is greatest for the initial period following
nuclear fallout when $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs are located close to the ground surface, and for
aerial surveys conducted at low altitudes. This is because the relative differences calculated
between RCP with respect to changes in the mass depth distribution were largest for these two cases.
Data on the measurement height above and on the $^{134}$Cs to $^{137}$Cs activity ratio is necessary
for applying the Compton-to-peak method to determine the distribution and radioactivity concentration
of $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs within the ground.

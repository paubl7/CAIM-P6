We are currently conceiving, through (MC) simulation, a multi-channel gamma detector array (TIARA
for Time-of-flight Imaging ARrAy) for the online monitoring of protontherapy treatments. By measuring
the Time-Of-Flight (TOF) between a beam monitor placed upstream and the Prompt-Gamma (PG) detector,
our goal is to reconstruct the PG vertex distribution to detect a possible deviation of proton beam
delivery. In this paper, two non-iterative reconstruction strategies are proposed. The first
is based on the resolution of an analytical formula describing the PG vertex distribution in 3D.
Here, it was resolved under a one-dimensional approximation in order to measure a potential proton
range shift along the beam direction. The second is based on the calculation of the Centre-Of-Gravity
(COG) of the TIARA pixel detectors counts and also provides 3D information on a possible beam displacement.
The PG vertex reconstruction was evaluated in two different scenarios. A coincidence time resolution
of 100 ps (rms) can be attained in single proton regime (operating a reduction of the beam current)
and using an external beam monitor to provide a start trigger for the TOF measurement. Under these
conditions, MC simulations have shown that a millimetric proton range shift sensitivity can be
achieved at 2$\sigma$ with 10$^{8}$ incident protons. This level of accuracy would allow to act
in real-time if the treatment does not conform to treatment plan. A worst case scenario of a 1 ns (rms)
TOF resolution was also considered to demonstrate that a degraded timing information can be compensated
by increasing the acquisition statistics: in this case, a 2 mm range shift would be detectable at
2$\sigma$ with 10$^{9}$ incident protons. The COG method has shown excellent capabilities of detecting
lateral beam displacements: a 2 mm sensitivity was found at 2$\sigma$ with 10$^{8}$ incident protons.

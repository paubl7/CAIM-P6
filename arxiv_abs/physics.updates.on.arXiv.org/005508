Pore-scale observation of vortical flow structures in porous media is a significant challenge
in many natural and industrial systems. Vortical structure dynamics is believed to be the driving
mechanism in the transition regime in porous media based on the pore Reynolds number, $Re_p$. To
examine this assertion, a refractive-index matched randomly packed porous medium is designed
to measure the scale of vortical flow structures in transition from unsteady laminar to turbulent
using two-dimensional time-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Planar PIV data for $Re_p$
from 100 to 948 is used to quantify the scale in terms of the size, strength, and number density using
two different scalings (i) $Re_p$ macroscopic (global), and (ii) $Re_{\langle p\rangle}$ microscopic
(local). Direct measurement of vortex scale is quantified by employing swirl strength, vortex
core, and enhanced swirl strength vortex identification methods. These scales are compared with
turbulent integral scales. Shear-dominant vortical structures in moderate unsteady laminar
Reynolds numbers ($Re_p <300$) were observed, while the swirl-dominant flow structures appeared
in weak turbulent Reynolds numbers ($Re_p>500$). From the macroscopic point of view, increasing
Rep resulted in, (i) reduction in the sizes of vortical structures to asymptotically to reach 20$\%$
of the global hydraulic diameter, (ii) growth in strength of vortices, and (iii) increase in the
average number densities of vortices. From the pore-scale (local) point of view, increasing $Re_{\langle
p\rangle}$ led to decrease in the size of vortical structures monotonically, (ii) rise of the strength
of vortices, and (iii) invariance in the number density of vortical structures. These findings
suggest pore versus macro-scale coupling exists for the scale of vortical flow structures in the
transition regime.

We present a first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and expound upon a mechanism
of oxygen depletion hypothesis to explain the mitigation of normal tissue injury observed in ultra-high-dose-rate
(UHDR) FLASH radiotherapy. We simulated damage to a segment of DNA (also representing other bio-molecules
such as RNA and proteins) in a simulation box filled with H$_2$O and O$_2$ molecules. Attoseconds
physical interactions (ionizations, electronic and vibrational excitations) were simulated
by using the Monte Carlo track structure code Geant4-DNA. Immediately after ionization, {\it ab
initio} Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) simulation was used to identify which H$_2$O
and O$_2$ molecules surrounding the DNA-molecule were converted into reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Subsequently, the femto- to nano-second reactions of ROS were simulated by using MD with
Reactive Force Field (ReaxFF), to illustrate ROS merging into new types of non-reactive oxygen
species (NROS) due to strong coupling among ROS. Time-dependent molecular simulations revealed
the formation of metastable and transient spaghetti-like complexes among ROS generated at UHDR.
At the higher ROS densities produced under UHDR, stranded chains (i.e., NROS) are produced, mediated
through attractive electric polarity forces, hydrogen bonds, and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions
among hydroxyl (\ce{^{.}OH}) radicals. NROS tend to be less mobile than cellular biomolecules
as opposed to the isolated and sparsely dense ROS generated at conventional dose rates (CDR). We
attribute this effect to the suppression of bio-molecular damage induced per particle track. At
a given oxygen level, as the dose rate increases, the size and number of NROS chains increase, and
correspondingly the population of toxic ROS components decreases.

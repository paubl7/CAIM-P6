Pellet ELM triggering is a well established scheme for decreasing the time between two successive
ELM crashes below its natural value. Reliable ELM pacing has been demonstrated experimentally
in several devices increasing the ELM frequency considerably. However, it was also shown that the
frequency cannot be increased arbitrarily due to a so-called lag-time. During this time after a
preceding natural or triggered ELM crash, neither a natural ELM crash occurs nor the triggering
of an ELM crash by pellet injection is possible. For this article, pellet ELM triggering simulations
are advanced beyond previous studies in two ways. Firstly, realistic ExB and diamagnetic background
flows are included. And secondly, the pellet is injected at different stages of the pedestal build-up.
This allows to recover the lag-time for the first time in simulations and investigate it in detail.
A series of non-linear extended MHD simulations is performed to investigate the plasma dynamics
resulting from an injection at different time points during the pedestal build-up. The experimentally
observed lag-time is qualitatively reproduced well. In particular, a sharp transition is observed
between the regime where no ELMs can be triggered and the regime where pellet injection causes an
ELM crash. Via variations of pellet parameters and injection time, the two regimes are studied and
compared in detail revealing pronounced differences in the non-linear dynamics. The toroidal
mode spectrum is significantly broader when an ELM crash is triggered enhancing the stochasticity
and therefore also the losses of thermal energy along magnetic field lines. In the heat fluxes to
the divertor targets, pronounced toroidal asymmetries are observed. In case of high injection
velocities leading to deep penetration, also the excitation of core modes like the $2/1$ neoclassical
tearing mode is observed.

In a recent study (Jozinovi\'c et al, 2020) we showed that convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
applied to network seismic traces can be used for rapid prediction of earthquake peak ground motion
intensity measures (IMs) at distant stations using only recordings from stations near the epicenter.
The predictions are made without any previous knowledge concerning the earthquake location and
magnitude. This approach differs from the standard procedure adopted by earthquake early warning
systems (EEWSs) that rely on location and magnitude information. In the previous study, we used
10 s, raw, multistation waveforms for the 2016 earthquake sequence in central Italy for 915 events
(CI dataset). The CI dataset has a large number of spatially concentrated earthquakes and a dense
station network. In this work, we applied the CNN model to an area around the VIRGO gravitational
waves observatory sited near Pisa, Italy. In our initial application of the technique, we used a
dataset consisting of 266 earthquakes recorded by 39 stations. We found that the CNN model trained
using this smaller dataset performed worse compared to the results presented in the original study
by Jozinovi\'c et al. (2020). To counter the lack of data, we adopted transfer learning (TL) using
two approaches: first, by using a pre-trained model built on the CI dataset and, next, by using a pre-trained
model built on a different (seismological) problem that has a larger dataset available for training.
We show that the use of TL improves the results in terms of outliers, bias, and variability of the residuals
between predicted and true IMs values. We also demonstrate that adding knowledge of station positions
as an additional layer in the neural network improves the results. The possible use for EEW is demonstrated
by the times for the warnings that would be received at the station PII.

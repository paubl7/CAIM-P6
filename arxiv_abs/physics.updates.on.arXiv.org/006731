The flow of viscoelastic wormlike micellar solutions (WLMs) in porous media is encountered in many
practical applications like enhanced oil recovery or groundwater remediation. To understand
the flow dynamics of these complex fluids in porous media, a model porous media consisting of a straight
microchannel with micropore throats present in it, is very often used. In this study, we perform
an extensive numerical investigation to understand the flow dynamics of wormlike micellar solutions
based on the two-species Vasquez-Cook-McKinley (VCM) model for micelles through such model porous
media. We find the existence of an elastic instability once the Weissenberg number exceeds a critical
value; likewise, it was seen in many prior experimental and numerical studies dealing with polymer
solutions. However, for the present case of a WLM solution, we observe that this elastic instability
is greatly influenced by the breakage and reformation mechanisms of the wormlike micelles. In particular,
we notice that the intensity of this instability (characterized by the fluctuating flow fields)
increases as the Weissenberg number increases; however, beyond a critical value of it, this elastic
instability and/or the flow field fluctuation is suppressed because of the breakage of long micelles.
This is in contrast to the polymer solutions for which the flow field gradually transits to a more
chaotic and turbulent-like state (or the so-called elastic turbulence state) as the Weissenberg
number gradually increases. Additionally, we observe that the flow dynamics of these WLM solutions
are strongly dependent on the type of micropore throat, the number of pore throats, and the spacing
between two consecutive pore throats. An extensive discussion on the pressure drop and apparent
viscosity is also presented in the present study.

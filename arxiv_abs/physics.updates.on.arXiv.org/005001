Even though Traumatic Brain Injuries remain one of the leading causes of death and disability, the
relationship between brain motion and injury is poorly understood, especially in the high strain
and high rate regime. Recently, high frame-rate (10,000 images/second) quantitative ultrasound
imaging has measured brain motion in a wide field of view (4 cm x 6 cm), with high displacement sensitivity
(< 1$\mu$m). The direct quantification of brain motion in this previously unobserved viscoelastodynamic
regime led to the discovery that shear waves develop into shear shocks deep inside the porcine brain.
Here we study the formation of shear shocks in the human head. High-order finite volume simulations
that describe the nonlinearity and viscosity responsible for shear shock wave formation in the
human head are used to determine the local acceleration, strain-rate, and strain for a range of frequency
and impact amplitudes. Quantitative ultrasound imaging of motion in a human head phantom are used
to experimentally observe shock formation and to validate the simulation tool in this regime. It
is shown that shear shocks form deep inside the brain, that they are focused at the geometrical center,
and that acceleration and strain-rate super-resolved. For a mild impact at 1.5 m/s, 24g at 25 Hz at
the brain surface, the shear shocks deep in the brain in the focal zone have a Mach number of 1.14, a
local acceleration 979g, and a strain-rate of 927 1/s. The focal zone is 56 times smaller than the
initial impact wavelength. Compared to linear viscoelastic predictions the acceleration is 41.29g,
the strain-rate is 124.2 1/s. The nonlinear shear shock wave physics is a necessary and primary component
of brain biomechanics which explosively amplifies the local biomechanical estimates. Including
shear shock wave physics may fundamentally change the way we approach the design of protective equipment.

Using 6 years of evaluation data we assess the medium- and long-term impacts upon a diverse range
of students, teachers, and schools from participating in a programme of protracted university-mentored
projects based in cutting-edge space science, astronomy, and particle physics research. After
having completed their 6-month-long projects, the 14-18 year-old school students report having
substantially increased in confidence relating to relevant scientific topics and methods as well
as having developed numerous skills, outcomes which are corroborated by teachers. There is evidence
that the projects helped increase students' aspirations towards physics, whereas science aspirations
(generally high to begin with) were typically maintained or confirmed through their involvement.
Longitudinal evaluation 3 years later has revealed that these projects have been lasting experiences
for students which they have benefited and drawn upon in their subsequent university education.
Data on students' destinations suggests that their involvement in research projects has made them
more likely to undertake physics and STEM degrees than would otherwise be expected. Cases of co-created
novel physics research resulting from PRiSE also has seemed to have a powerful effect, not only on
the student co-authors but participating students from other schools also. Teachers have also
been positively affected through participating, with the programme having influenced their own
knowledge, skills, and pedagogy, as well as having advantageous effects felt across their wider
schools. These impacts suggest that similar `research in schools' initiatives may have a role to
play in aiding the increased uptake and diversity of physics and/or STEM in higher education as well
as meaningfully enhancing the STEM environment within schools.

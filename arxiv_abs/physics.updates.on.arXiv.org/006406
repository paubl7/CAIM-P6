Optical frequency stabilization is a critical component for precision scientific systems including
quantum sensing, precision metrology, and atomic timekeeping. Ultra-high quality factor photonic
integrated optical resonators are a prime candidate for reducing their size, weight and cost as
well as moving these systems on chip. However, integrated resonators suffer from temperature-dependent
resonance drift due to the large thermal response as well as sensitivity to external environmental
perturbations. Suppression of the cavity resonance drift can be achieved using precision interrogation
of the cavity temperature through the dual-mode optical thermometry. This approach enables measurement
of the cavity temperature change by detecting the resonance difference shift between two polarization
or optical frequency modes. Yet this approach has to date only been demonstrated in bulk-optic whispering
gallery mode and fiber resonators. In this paper, we implement dual-mode optical thermometry using
dual polarization modes in a silicon nitride waveguide resonator for the first time, to the best
of our knowledge. The temperature responsivity and sensitivity of the dual-mode TE/TM resonance
difference is 180.7$\pm$2.5 MHz/K and 82.56 $\mu$K, respectively, in a silicon nitride resonator
with a 179.9E6 intrinsic TM mode Q factor and a 26.6E6 intrinsic TE mode Q factor. Frequency stabilization
is demonstrated by locking a laser to the TM mode cavity resonance and applying the dual-mode resonance
difference to a feedforward laser frequency drift correction circuit with a drift rate improvement
to 0.31 kHz/s over the uncompensated 10.03 kHz/s drift rate. Allan deviation measurements with
dual-mode feedforward-correction engaged shows that a fractional frequency instability of 9.6E-11
over 77 s can be achieved.

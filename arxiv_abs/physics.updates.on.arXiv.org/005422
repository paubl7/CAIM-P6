The paper is devoted to an adjoint complement to the universal Law of the Wall (LoW) for fluid dynamic
momentum boundary layers. The latter typically follows from a strongly simplified, unidirectional
shear flow under a constant stress assumption. We first derive the adjoint companion of the simplified
momentum equation, while distinguishing between two strategies. Using mixing-length arguments,
we demonstrate that the frozen turbulence strategy and a LoW-consistent (differentiated) approach
provide virtually the same adjoint momentum equations, that differ only in a single scalar coefficient
controlling the inclination in the logarithmic region. Moreover, it is seen that an adjoint LoW
can be derived which resembles its primal counterpart in many aspects. The strategy is also compatible
with wall-function assumptions for prominent RANS-type two-equation turbulence models, which
ground on the mixing-length hypothesis. As a direct consequence of the frequently employed assumption
that all primal flow properties algebraically scale with the friction velocity, it is demonstrated
that a simple algebraic expression provides a consistent closure of the adjoint momentum equation
in the logarithmic layer. This algebraic adjoint closure might also serve as an approximation for
more general adjoint flow optimization studies using standard one- or two-equation Boussinesq-viscosity
models for the primal flow. Results obtained from the suggested algebraic closure are verified
against the primal/adjoint LoW formulations for both, low- and high-Re settings. Applications
included in this paper refer to two- and three-dimensional shape optimizations of internal and
external engineering flows. Related results indicate that the proposed adjoint algebraic turbulence
closure accelerates the optimization process and provides improved optima in comparison to the
frozen turbulence approach.

We present a thorough numerical study on the MRI using the smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics
method (SPMHD) with the geometric density average force expression (GDSPH). We perform shearing
box simulations with different initial setups and a wide range of resolution and dissipation parameters.
We show, for the first time, that MRI with sustained turbulence can be simulated successfully with
SPH, with results consistent with prior work with grid-based codes. In particular, for the stratified
boxes, our simulations reproduce the characteristic butterfly diagram of the MRI dynamo with saturated
turbulence for at least 100 orbits. On the contrary, traditional SPH simulations suffer from runaway
growth and develop unphysically large azimuthal fields, similar to the results from a recent study
with mesh-less methods. We investigated the dependency of MRI turbulence on the numerical Prandtl
number in SPH, focusing on the unstratified, zero net-flux case. We found that turbulence can only
be sustained with a Prandtl number larger than $\sim$2.5, similar to the critical values of physical
Prandtl number found in grid-code simulations. However, unlike grid-based codes, the numerical
Prandtl number in SPH increases with resolution, and for a fixed Prandtl number, the resulting magnetic
energy and stresses are independent of resolution. Mean-field analyses were performed on all simulations,
and the resulting transport coefficients indicate no $\alpha$-effect in the unstratified cases,
but an active $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo and a diamagnetic pumping effect in the stratified medium,
which are generally in agreement with previous studies. There is no clear indication of a shear-current
dynamo in our simulation, which is likely to be responsible for a weaker mean-field growth in the
tall, unstratified, zero net-flux simulation.

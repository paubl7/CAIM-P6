Photosynthesis is an ancient metabolic process that began on the early Earth, offering plentiful
energy to organisms that utilize it, to the extent that they can achieve global significance. The
potential exists for similar processes to operate on habitable exoplanets and result in observable
biosignatures. Prior to the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis, the most primitive phototrophs,
anoxygenic phototrophs, dominated surface environments on the planet. Here, we characterize
surface polarization biosignatures associated with a diverse sample of anoxygenic phototrophs
and cyanobacteria, examining both pure cultures and microbial communities from the natural environment.
Polarimetry is a tool that can be used to measure the chiral signature of biomolecules. Chirality
is considered a universal, agnostic biosignature that is independent of a planet's biochemistry,
receiving considerable interest as a target biosignature for life detection missions. In contrast
to preliminary indications from earlier work, we show that there is a diversity of distinctive circular
polarization signatures, including the magnitude of the polarization, associated with the variety
of chiral photosynthetic pigments and pigment complexes of anoxygenic and oxygenic phototrophs.
We also show that the apparent death and release of pigments from one of the phototrophs is accompanied
by an elevation of the reflectance polarization signal by an order of magnitude, which may be significant
for remotely detectable environmental signatures. This work and others suggest circular polarization
signals up to ~1% may occur, significantly stronger than previously anticipated circular polarization
levels. We conclude that global surface polarization biosignatures may arise from anoxygenic
and oxygenic phototrophs, which have dominated nearly 80% of the history of our rocky, inhabited
planet.

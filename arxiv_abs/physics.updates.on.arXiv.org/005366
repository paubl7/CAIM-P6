Polarization singularities of vectorial electromagnetic fields locate at the positions (such
as points, lines, or surfaces) where properties of polarization ellipses are not defined. They
are manifested as circular and linear polarization, for which respectively the semi-major axes
and normal vectors of polarization ellipses become indefinite. First observed in conical diffraction
in the 1830s, the field of polarization singularities has been systematically reshaped and deepened
by many pioneers of wave optics. Together with other exotic phenomena such as non-Hermiticity and
topology, polarization singularities have been introduced into the vibrant field of nanophotonics,
rendering unprecedented flexibilities for manipulations of light-matter interactions at the
nanoscale. Here we review the recent results on the generation and observation of polarization
singularities in metaphotonics. We start with the discussion of polarization singularities in
the Mie theory, where both electric and magnetic multipoles are explored from perspectives of local
and global polarization properties. We then proceed with the discussion of various photonic-crystal
structures, for which both near- and far-field patterns manifest diverse polarization singularities
characterized by the integer Poincare or more general half-integer Hopf indices (topological
charges). Next, we review the most recent studies of conversions from polarization to phase singularities
in scalar wave optics, demonstrating how bound states in the continuum can be exploited to generate
directly optical vortices of various charges. Throughout our paper, we discuss and highlight several
fundamental concepts and demonstrate their close connections and special links to metaphotonics.
We believe polarization singularities can provide novel perspectives for light-matter manipulation
for both fundamental studies and their practical applications.

JOREK is a massively parallel fully implicit non-linear extended MHD code for realistic tokamak
X-point plasmas. It is a widely used versatile code for studying large-scale plasma instabilities
and their control and is continuously developed in an international community with strong involvements
in European fusion research. This article gives a comprehensive overview of the physics models
implemented, numerical methods applied for solving the equations and physics studies performed
with the code. A dedicated section highlights verification work. A hierarchy of different physics
models is available including a free boundary and resistive wall extension and hybrid kinetic-fluid
models. The code allows for flux-surface aligned iso-parametric finite element grids in single
and double X-point plasmas, which can be extended to the physical walls and uses a robust fully implicit
time stepping. Particular focus is laid on plasma edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) physics as well
as disruption related phenomena. Among the key results obtained with JOREK regarding plasma edge
and SOL, are deep insights into the dynamics of edge localized modes (ELMs), ELM cycles, and ELM control
by resonant magnetic perturbations, pellet injection, as well as by vertical magnetic kicks. Also
ELM free regimes, detachment physics, the generation and transport of impurities during an ELM,
and electrostatic turbulence in the pedestal region are investigated. Regarding disruptions,
the focus is on the dynamics of the thermal quench and current quench triggered by massive gas injection
(MGI) and shattered pellet injection (SPI), runaway electron (RE) dynamics as well as the RE interaction
with MHD modes, and vertical displacement events (VDEs). Also the seeding and suppression of tearing
modes (TMs), the dynamics of naturally occurring thermal quenches triggered by locked modes, and
radiative collapses are being studied.

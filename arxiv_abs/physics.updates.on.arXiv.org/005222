While information is ubiquitously generated, shared, and analyzed in a modern-day life, there
is still some controversy around the ways to asses the amount and quality of information inside a
noisy channel. A number of theoretical approaches based on, e.g., conditional Shannon entropy
and Fisher information have been developed, along with some experimental validations. Some of
these approaches are limited to a certain alphabet, while others tend to fall short when considering
optical beams with non-trivial wavefront topology, such as orbital momentum laser modes. Here,
we introduce the concept of expressing information as a measure of structure in a laser beam. We propose
a new definition of classical Shannon information via the Wigner distribution function, while
respecting the Heisenberg inequality. Following this, we calculate the amount of information
in a Gaussian, Hermite-Gaussian, and Laguerre-Gaussian laser modes in juxtaposition and experimentally
validate it by reconstruction of the Wigner distribution function from the intensity distribution
of structured laser beams. We experimentally demonstrate measuring structure of the laser beams
in singular optics to assess the amount of contained information. Given the generality of this approach
of defining information via analyzing the beam complexity is applicable to laser modes of any topology
that can be described by 'well-behaved' functions. Classical Shannon information defined in this
way is detached from a particular alphabet, i.e. communication scheme, and scales with the structural
complexity of the system. Such a synergy between the Wigner distribution function encompassing
the information in both real and reciprocal space, and information being a measure of disorder,
can contribute into future coherent detection algorithms and remote sensing.

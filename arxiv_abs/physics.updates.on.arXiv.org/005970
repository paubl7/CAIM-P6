JOREK is a massively parallel fully implicit non-linear extended MHD code for realistic tokamak
X-point plasmas. It has become a widely used versatile code for studying large-scale plasma instabilities
and their control developed in an international community. This article gives a comprehensive
overview of the physics models implemented, numerical methods applied for solving the equations
and physics studies performed with the code. A dedicated section highlights some of the verification
work done for the code. A hierarchy of different physics models is available including a free boundary
and resistive wall extension and hybrid kinetic-fluid models. The code allows for flux-surface
aligned iso-parametric finite element grids in single and double X-point plasmas which can be extended
to the true physical walls and uses a robust fully implicit time stepping. Particular focus is laid
on plasma edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) physics as well as disruption related phenomena. Among
the key results obtained with JOREK regarding plasma edge and SOL, are deep insights into the dynamics
of edge localized modes (ELMs), ELM cycles, and ELM control by resonant magnetic perturbations,
pellet injection, as well as by vertical magnetic kicks. Also ELM free regimes, detachment physics,
the generation and transport of impurities during an ELM, and electrostatic turbulence in the pedestal
region are investigated. Regarding disruptions, the focus is on the dynamics of the thermal quench
and current quench triggered by massive gas injection (MGI) and shattered pellet injection (SPI),
runaway electron (RE) dynamics as well as the RE interaction with MHD modes, and vertical displacement
events (VDEs). Also the seeding and suppression of tearing modes (TMs), the dynamics of naturally
occurring thermal quenches triggered by locked modes, and radiative collapses are being studied.

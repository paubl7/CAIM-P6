Fifty years ago the standard model offered an elegant new step towards understanding elementary
fermion and boson fields, making several assumptions, suggested by experiments. The assumptions
are still waiting for explanations. There are many proposals in the literature for the next step.
The spin-charge-family theory of one of us (N.S.M.B.) is offering the explanation for not only all
by the standard model assumed properties of quarks and leptons and antiquarks and antileptons,
with the families included, of the vectors gauge fields, of the Higgs's scalar and Yukawa couplings,
but also for the second quantization postulates of Dirac and for cosmological observations, like
there are the appearance of the dark matter, of matter-antimatter asymmetry, making several predictions.
This theory proposes a simple starting action in d=(13+1)-dimensional space with fermions interacting
with the gravity only, what manifests in d=(3+1) as the vector and scalar gauge fields, and uses the
odd Clifford algebra to describe the internal space of fermions, what enables that the creation
and annihilation operators for fermions fulfill the anticommutation relations for the second
quantized fields without Dirac's postulates: Fermions single particle states already anticommute.
We present in this review article a short overview of the spin-charge-family theory, illustrating
shortly on the toy model the breaks of the starting symmetries in d=(13+1)-dimensional space, which
are triggered either by scalar fields - the vielbeins with the space index belonging to d>(3+1) -
or by the condensate of the two right handed neutrinos, with the family quantum number not belonging
to the observed families. We compare properties and predictions of this theory with the properties
and predictions of SO(10) unifying theories.

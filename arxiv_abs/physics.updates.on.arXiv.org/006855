Background: Magnetic field inhomogeneities generate important geometric distortions in reconstructed
echo-planar images. Various procedures were proposed for correcting these distortions on brain
images; yet, few neuroimaging studies tailored and incorporated the use of these techniques in
spinal cord diffusion MRI. Purpose: We present a comparative evaluation of distortion correction
methods that use the reversed gradient polarity technique on spinal cord. We propose novel geometric
metrics to measure the alignment of the reconstructed diffusion model with the apparent centerline
of the spinal cord. Subjects: 95 subjects, among which 29 healthy controls and 66 multiple sclerosis
patients. Assessment: Geometric distortions were corrected using 4 state-of-the-art methods.
We measured the alignment of the principal direction of diffusion with the apparent centerline
of the spine after correction and the correlation with the reference anatomical image. Results
are computed per vertebral level, to evaluate the impact on different portions of the spine. Besides,
subjective evaluation of the quality of the correction of healthy subjects images was performed
by three expert raters. Results: As a result of distortion correction, the diffusion directions
are better aligned locally with the centerline, in particular at both ends of the acquisition window.
The cross-correlation with anatomical image is also improved by Hyperelastic Susceptibility
Artefact Correction (HySCO) and block-matching. The subjective evaluation for HySCO is significantly
better (p < 0.05) than for Block-Matching; TOPUP performs significantly worse than the three other
methods. Conclusion: Correction based on HySCO provide best results among the selected methods.

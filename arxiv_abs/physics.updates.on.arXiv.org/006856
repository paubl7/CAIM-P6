Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system. Quantitative MRI
has huge potential to provide intrinsic and normative values of tissue properties useful for diagnosis,
prognosis and ultimately clinical follow-up of this disease. However, there is a large discrepancy
between the clinical observations and how the pathology is exhibited in MRI brain scans. Complementary
to brain imaging, the study of multiple sclerosis lesions in the spinal cord has recently gained
interest as a potential marker for early physical impairment. Therefore, investigating how the
spinal cord is damaged using quantitative imaging, in particular, diffusion MRI, becomes an acute
challenge. In this work, we extract average diffusion MRI metrics per vertebral level from spinal
cord data acquired from multiple clinical sites. The diffusion-based metrics involved are extracted
from the diffusion tensor imaging and Ball-and-Stick models and quantified for every cervical
vertebral level using a collection of image processing methods and an atlas-based approach. Then,
we perform a statistical analysis study to characterize the feasibility of these metrics to detect
lesions. Specifically, we study the usefulness of combining different metrics to improve the accuracy
prediction score associated with the presence of multiple sclerosis lesions. We demonstrate the
grade of sensitivity to underlying microstructure changes in MS patients of each metric. Ball-and-Stick
provides novel information about the MS damage to tissue microstructure. In addition, we show that
choosing a subset of metrics: [FA, RD, MD] and [FWW, MD, Stick-AD, RD], which bring complementary
information, has significantly increased the prediction score of the presence of the MS lesion
in the cervical spinal cord.

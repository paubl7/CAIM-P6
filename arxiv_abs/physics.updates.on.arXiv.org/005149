In high-speed flow past a normal shock, the fluid temperature rises rapidly triggering downstream
chemical dissociation reactions. The chemical changes lead to appreciable changes in fluid properties,
and these coupled multiphysics and the resulting multiscale dynamics are challenging to resolve
numerically. Using conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) requires excessive computing
cost. Here, we propose a totally new efficient approach, assuming that some sparse measurements
of the state variables are available that can be seamlessly integrated in the simulation algorithm.
We employ a special neural network for approximating nonlinear operators, the DeepONet, which
is used to predict separately each individual field, given inputs from the rest of the fields of the
coupled multiphysics system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepONet by predicting five
species in the non-equilibrium chemistry downstream of a normal shock at high Mach numbers as well
as the velocity and temperature fields. We show that upon training, DeepONets can be over five orders
of magnitude faster than the CFD solver employed to generate the training data and yield good accuracy
for unseen Mach numbers within the range of training. Outside this range, DeepONet can still predict
accurately and fast if a few sparse measurements are available. We then propose a composite supervised
neural network, DeepM&Mnet, that uses multiple pre-trained DeepONets as building blocks and scattered
measurements to infer the set of all seven fields in the entire domain of interest. Two DeepM&Mnet
architectures are tested, and we demonstrate the accuracy and capacity for efficient data assimilation.
DeepM&Mnet is simple and general: it can be employed to construct complex multiphysics and multiscale
models and assimilate sparse measurements using pre-trained DeepONets in a "plug-and-play" mode.

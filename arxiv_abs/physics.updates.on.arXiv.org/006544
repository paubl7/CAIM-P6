The dynamics and spectroscopy of N-methyl-acetamide (NMA) and trialanine in solution is characterized
from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using different energy functions, including a conventional
point charge (PC)-based force field, one based on a multipolar (MTP) representation of the electrostatics,
and a semiempirical DFT method. For the 1-d infrared spectra, the frequency splitting between the
two amide-I groups is 10 cm$^{-1}$ from the PC, 13 cm$^{-1}$ from the MTP, and 47 cm$^{-1}$ from SCC-DFTB
simulations, compared with 25 cm$^{-1}$ from experiment. The frequency trajectory required for
determining the frequency fluctuation correlation function (FFCF) is determined from individual
(INM) and full normal mode (FNM) analyses of the amide-I vibrations. The spectroscopy, time-zero
magnitude of the FFCF $C(t=0)$, and the static component $\Delta_0^2$ from simulations using MTP
and analysis based on FNM are all consistent with experiments for (Ala)$_3$. Contrary to that, for
the analysis excluding mode-mode coupling (INM) the FFCF decays to zero too rapidly and for simulations
with a PC-based force field the $\Delta_0^2$ is too small by a factor of two compared with experiments.
Simulations with SCC-DFTB agree better with experiment for these observables than those from PC-based
simulations. The conformational ensemble sampled from simulations using PCs is consistent with
the literature , whereas that covered by the MTP-based simulations is dominated by P$_{\rm II}$
which agrees with and confirms recently reported, Bayesian-refined populations based on 1-dimensional
infrared experiments. Full normal mode analysis together with a MTP representation provides a
meaningful model to correctly describe the dynamics of hydrated trialanine.

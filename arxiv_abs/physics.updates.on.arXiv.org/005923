The CMS Collaboration intends to pursue the study of central exclusive production (CEP) events,
pp $\to$ pXp, at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) by means of a new near-beam proton spectrometer.
In CEP events, the state X is produced at central rapidities, and the scattered protons do not leave
the beam pipe. The kinematics of X can be fully reconstructed from that of the protons, which gives
access to final states otherwise not visible. CEP allows unique sensitivity to physics beyond the
standard model, e.g. in the search for anomalous quartic gauge couplings, axion-like particles,
and in general new resonances. CMS has been successfully operating the Precision Proton Spectrometer
(PPS), initially a joint CMS and TOTEM project, since 2016. The present document outlines the physics
interest of a new PPS at the HL-LHC, and explores its feasibility and expected performance. Discussions
with the machine groups led to the identification of four locations suitable for the installation
of movable proton detectors: at 196, 220, 234, and 420 m from the interaction point, on both sides.
Acceptance studies indicate that having the beams cross in the vertical plane at the interaction
point, as implemented after Long Shutdown 3, is preferable over the present horizontal crossing.
This gives access to states X in the mass range 133 GeV$-$2.7 TeV with the stations at 196, 220, and
234 m. The lower mass limit becomes 43 GeV if the 420 m station is included, which makes it possible
to study central exclusive production of the 125 GeV Higgs boson. This is a major improvement with
respect to the current mass range of 350 GeV$-$2 TeV. The project and its costs can easily be staged;
the 420 m station can be addressed in a second step. In summary, a new near-beam proton spectrometer
for operation at the HL-LHC appears feasible. It would greatly extend the CMS physics reach with
a limited investment.

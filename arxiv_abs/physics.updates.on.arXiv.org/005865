Demonstrations of quantum advantage have largely focused on computational speedups and on quantum
simulation of many-body physics, limited by fidelity and capability of current devices. Discriminating
laser-pulse-modulated classical-communication codewords at the minimum allowable probability
of error using universal-quantum processing presents a promising parallel direction, one that
is of both fundamental importance in quantum state discrimination, as well as of technological
relevance in deep-space laser communications. Here we present an experimental realization of
a quantum joint detection receiver for binary phase shift keying modulated codewords of a 3-bit
linear tree code using a recently-proposed quantum algorithm: belief propagation with quantum
messages. The receiver, translated to a quantum circuit, was experimentally implemented on a trapped-ion
device -- the recently released Honeywell LT-1.0 system using ${}^{171}Yb+ $ ions, which possesses
all-to-all connectivity and mid-circuit measurement capabilities that are essential to this
demonstration. We conclusively realize a previously postulated but hitherto not-demonstrated
joint quantum detection scheme, and provide an experimental framework that surpasses the quantum
limit on the minimum average decoding error probability associated with pulse-by-pulse detection
in the low mean photon number limit. The full joint-detection scheme bridges across photonic and
trapped-ion based quantum information science, mapping the photonic coherent states of the modulation
alphabet onto inner product-preserving states of single-ion qubits. Looking ahead, our work opens
new avenues in hybrid realizations of quantum-enhanced receivers with applications in astronomy
and emerging space-based platforms.

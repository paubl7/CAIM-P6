It has been recently discovered that the measles virus can wipe out the adaptive immune system, destroying
B lymphocytes and reducing the diversity of non-specific B cells of the infected host. In particular,
this implies that previously acquired immunization from vaccination or direct exposition to other
pathogens could be erased in a phenomenon named "immune amnesia", whose effects can become particularly
worrisome given the actual rise of anti-vaccination movements. Here we present the first attempt
to incorporate immune amnesia into standard models of epidemic spreading. In particular, we analyze
diverse variants of a model that describes the spreading of two concurrent pathogens causing measles
and another generic disease: the SIR-IA model. Analytical and computational studies confirm that
immune amnesia can indeed have important consequences for epidemic spreading, significantly
altering the vaccination coverage required to reach herd-immunity for concurring infectious
diseases. More specifically, we uncover the existence of novel propagating and endemic phases
which are induced by immune amnesia, that appear both in fully-connected and more structured networks,
such as random networks and power-law degree-distributed ones. In particular, the transitions
from a quiescent state into these novel phases can become rather abrupt in some cases that we specifically
analyze. Furthermore, we discuss the meaning and consequences of our results and their relation
with, e.g., immunization strategies, together with the possibility that explosive types of transitions
may emerge, making immune-amnesia effects particularly dramatic. This work opens the door to further
developments and analyses of immune amnesia effects, contributing, more generally, to the theory
of interacting epidemics on complex networks.

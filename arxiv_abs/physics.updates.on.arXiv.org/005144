Nonadiabatic effects that arise from the concerted motion of electrons and atoms at comparable
energy and time scales are omnipresent in thermal and light-driven chemistry at metal surfaces.
Excited (hot) electrons can measurably affect molecule-metal reactions by contributing to state-dependent
reaction probabilities. Vibrational state-to-state scattering of NO on Au(111) has been one of
the most studied examples in this regard, providing a testing ground for developing various nonadiabatic
theories. This system is often cited as the prime example for the failure of electronic friction
theory, a very efficient model accounting for dissipative forces on metal-adsorbed molecules
due to the creation of hot electrons in the metal. However, the exact failings compared to experiment
and their origin from theory are not established for any system, because dynamic properties are
affected by many com-pounding simulation errors of which the quality of nonadiabatic treatment
is just one. We use a high-dimensional machine learning representation of electronic structure
theory to minimize errors that arise from quantum chemistry. This allows us to perform a comprehensive
quantitative analysis of the performance of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics in describing vibrational
state-to-state scattering of NO on Au(111) and compare directly to adiabatic results. We find that
electronic friction theory accurately predicts elastic and single-quantum energy loss, but underestimates
multi-quantum energy loss and overestimates molecular trapping at high vibrational excitation.
Our analysis reveals that that multi-quantum energy loss can potentially be remedied within friction
theory, whereas overestimation of trapping constitutes a genuine breakdown of electronic friction
theory, the correct account of which in catalysis and surface chemistry requires more sophisticated
theories.

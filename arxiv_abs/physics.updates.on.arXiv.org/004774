We propose a new approach to unambiguous determination of parameters of positive and negative electric
streamer discharges. From hydrodynamic equations, in the assumption of a solution in the shape
of a streamer, it is possible to derive several relations between streamer parameters, which form
a system of algebraic equations (SAE). Because of the made approximations, the error in the solution
of this system is expected to be probably up to a few tens of percent. Solving the SAE allows us to express
all streamer parameters in terms of the streamer length $L$, the constant uniform external electric
field $E_e$, and the streamer radius. The solutions with different radii are valid solutions of
the hydrodynamic equations, and are analogous to the propagation modes of flat-front perturbations
with different transverse wavelengths. We interpret the streamer as a nonlinear instability,
whose behavior is determined by choosing the radius at which the velocity is maximized, because,
as we show, the velocity plays the same role as the exponential growth rate in the case of linear instabilities.
Thus, streamer behavior is unambiguously determined by $E_e$ and $L$, in a relatively computationally
economical way. In contrast, numerical methods of solving the microscopic equations, such as hydrodynamic
simulations, are more computationally demanding, and the preferred solution in them arises automatically
because of numerical fluctuations. The calculations for air at sea level conditions produce reasonable
values for commonly observed streamer parameters. The calculated positive streamer velocities
and negative threshold fields are compatible with experimental measurements. The physical reason
for the positive threshold fields is also discussed. A much simplified analytical model (Appendix
B) reproduces many of the presented results, at least qualitatively.

Reduced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations are used to study the nonlinear dynamics of external
kinks in a quasi-axisymmetric (QA) stellarator with varying fractions of external rotational
transform. The large bootstrap currents associated with high beta plasmas may make QA configurations
susceptible to low n external modes, limiting their operational space. The violence of the nonlinear
dynamics, and, in particular, when these modes lead to a disruption, is not yet understood. In this
paper, the nonlinear phase of external kinks in an unstable QA configuration with an edge safety
factor below two is simulated. An axisymmetric approximation of this stellarator is constructed
in the nonlinear MHD code, JOREK, capturing the influence of the external rotational transform.
The use of this approximation for the considered stellarator is validated by comparing the linear
dynamics against the linear viscoresistive MHD code, CASTOR3D. The nonlinear dynamics of this
stellarator approximation are compared with an equivalent tokamak to understand the influence
of a relatively small external rotational transform. While the external rotational transform
does have a stabilising influence on the MHD activity, it remains violent. To explore the first order
influence of a larger external rotational transform, this equilibrium parameter is artificially
increased for the considered stellarator, reducing the effective plasma current. The violence
of the kink instability is quantified, and shown to reduce with the increasing external rotational
transform. At the same time, the external kink triggers internal modes that exacerbate the loss
in confinement during the nonlinear phase, such that it remains large over much of the parameter
space. It is only with a significant fraction of external rotational transform that these subsequent
modes are stabilised.

Breaking waves generate a distribution of bubble sizes that evolves over time. Knowledge of how
this distribution evolves is of practical importance for maritime and climate studies. The analytical
framework developed in Part 1 examined how this evolution is governed by the bubble-mass flux from
large to small bubble sizes, which depends on the rate of break-up events and the distribution of
child bubble sizes. These statistics are measured in Part 2 as ensemble-averaged functions of time
by simulating ensembles of breaking waves, and identifying and tracking individual bubbles and
their break-up events. The break-up dynamics are seen to be statistically unsteady, and two intervals
with distinct characteristics were identified. In the first interval, the dissipation rate and
bubble-mass flux are quasi-steady, and the theoretical analysis of Part 1 is supported by all observed
statistics, including the expected -10/3 power-law exponent for the super-Hinze-scale size distribution.
Strong locality is observed in the corresponding bubble-mass flux, supporting the presence of
a super-Hinze-scale break-up cascade. In the second interval, the dissipation rate decays, and
the bubble-mass flux increases as small- and intermediate-sized bubbles become more populous.
This flux remains strongly local with cascade-like behaviour, but the dominant power-law exponent
for the size distribution increases to -8/3 as small bubbles are also depleted more quickly. This
suggests the emergence of different physical mechanisms during different phases of the breaking-wave
evolution, although size-local break-up remains a dominant theme. Parts 1 and 2 present an analytical
toolkit for population balance analysis in two-phase flows.

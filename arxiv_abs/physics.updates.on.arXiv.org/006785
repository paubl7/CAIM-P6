In this paper, we report on the photon emission of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) from dark noise
charge avalanches, with the main objective of better understanding the associated systematics
for next-generation, large area, SiPM-based physics experiments. A new apparatus for spectral
and imaging analysis was developed at TRIUMF and used to measure the light produced by two SiPMs considered
as photo-sensor candidates for the nEXO neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment: one Fondazione
Bruno Kessler (FBK) VUV-HD Low Field (LF) Low After Pulse (Low AP) (VUV-HD3) SiPM, and one Hamamatsu
Photonics K.K. (HPK) VUV4 Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC). Spectral measurements of their light
emission were taken with varying over-voltage in the wavelength range of 450--1020 nm. For the FBK
VUV-HD3, at an over-voltage of $12.1 \pm 1.0$ V, we measure a photon yield (number of photons ($\gamma$)
emitted per charge carrier ($e^{-}$)) of $(4.04 \pm 0.02) \times10^{-6}$ $\gamma / e^{-}$. The
emission spectrum of the FBK VUV-HD3 contains an interference pattern consistent with thin-film
interference. Additionally, images of the FBK VUV-HD3 show a small number of highly localized regions
with increased light intensity (hotspots) randomly distributed over the SiPM surface area. For
the HPK VUV4 MPPC, at an over-voltage of $10.7\pm 1.0$ V, we measure a photon yield of $(8.71\pm 0.04)
\times 10^{-6}$ $\gamma / e^{-}$. In contrast to the FBK VUV-HD3, the emission spectra of the HPK
VUV4 don't show an interference pattern -- most likely due to a thinner surface coating. Images of
the HPK VUV4 also reveal a larger number of hotspots compared to the FBK VUV-HD3, especially in one
of the corners of the device. If the occurrence of hotspots in the SiPMs is caused by an increase of
crystal defects, generally due to fabrication processes, we could conclude that the FBK production
is cleaner than that of HPK MPPCs.

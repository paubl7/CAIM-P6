The Schelling model of segregation moves colored agents on the vertices of a graph, with unhappy
agents trying to move to new positions if the number of their neighbors with a different color exceeds
some threshold. In this work, we consider race and socioeconomic status simultaneously to understand
how carefully architected placement of urban infrastructure might affect segregation. We designate
certain vertices on the graph as "urban sites", providing civic infrastructure that most benefits
the poorer population. Infrastructure that is centralized, like a city center or mall, encourages
poor agents to cluster centrally in addition to their homophily preferences for the same-colored
neighbors, while infrastructure that is well distributed, like a large grid of inner-city bus routes,
tends to disperse the low-income agents. We ask what effect these two scenarios have on segregation.
We prove that centralized infrastructure simultaneously causes segregation and the "urbanization
of poverty" (i.e., occupation of urban sites primarily by poor agents) when the homophily and incentives
drawing the poor to urban sites are large enough. Moreover, even when homophily preferences are
very small, as long as the incentives drawing the poor to urban sites is large, under income inequality
where one race has a higher proportion of the poor, we get racial segregation on urban sites but integration
on non-urban sites. However, we find overall mitigation of segregation when the urban sites are
distributed throughout the graph and the incentive drawing the poor on the urban sites exceeds the
homophily preference. We prove that in this case, no matter how strong homophily preferences are,
it will be exponentially unlikely that a configuration chosen from stationarity will have large,
homogeneous clusters of similarly colored agents, thus promoting integration in the city with
high probability.

Anatomical motion and deformation pose challenges to the understanding of the delivered dose distribution
during radiotherapy treatments. Hence, deformable image registration (DIR) algorithms are increasingly
used to map contours and dose distributions from one image set to another. However, the lack of validation
tools slows their clinical adoption, despite their commercial availability. This work presents
a novel water-equivalent deformable dosimeter that simultaneously measures the dose distribution
and tracks deformation vector fields (DVF). The dosimeter in made of an array of 19 scintillating
fiber detectors embedded in a cylindrical elastomer matrix. It is imaged by two pairs of stereoscopic
cameras tracking the position and angulation of the scintillators, while measuring the dose. The
resulting system provides a precision of 0.3 mm on DVF measurements. The dosimeter was irradiated
with 5$\times$3, 4$\times$3 and 3$\times$3 cm$^2$ 6 MV photon beams in both fixed and deformed conditions.
The measured DVF was compared to the one computed with a DIR algorithm (Plastimatch). The deviations
between the computed and measured DVFs was below 1.5 mm. As for dose measurements, the dosimeter
acquired the dose distribution in fixed and deformed conditions within 1\% of the treatment planning
system calculation and complementary dose validation using the Hyperscint dosimetry system.
Using the demonstrated qualities of scintillating detectors, we developed a real-time, water-equivalent
deformable dosimeter. Given it's sensor tracking position precision and dose measurements accuracy,
the developed detector is a promising tools for the validation of DIR algorithms as well as dose distribution
measurements under fixed and deformed conditions.

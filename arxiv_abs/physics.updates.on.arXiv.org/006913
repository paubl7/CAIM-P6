The study of cavity flow is one of the most important research topics of unsteady aerodynamics. Supersonic
turbulent flows over a cavity are mostly encountered in missiles, turbomachinery, and high-speed
aircraft. The turbulence inside the cavity gives rise to excess drag, acoustic waves, pressure
fluctuations, and vibrations which may lead to numerous problems like excess fuel consumption,
failure of missile trajectory or mechanical parts, and aerodynamic heating. We conduct numerical
simulations to investigate the flow and compare our results to existing experimental data to show
quantitative validation. We then investigate the effect of the Mach number of the turbulent supersonic
flow on the pressure contours and the vortical structures inside the cavity and the subsequent effect
on other flow parameters like acoustic waves. Thereafter, we propose two modifications of the cavity
geometry, a) slanted edges and b) smoothened corners with slanted edges, to improve the aerodynamic
performance. ANSYS ICEM tool has been used for the fine mesh generation of our cavity geometry and
all the simulation was run on ANSYS fluent software. The K omega SST turbulence model was used for
the simulation as it can capture the near wall property with reasonable accuracy and a grid independence
study was carried out to find the correct solution of the Navier Stokes equation was proceeding by
the solver. The parameters like pressure contours, streamline pattern, coefficient of pressure
distribution and sound pressure level (SPL) has been found and compared for both modified and unmodified
open cavity at different Mach number. The modifications suggested show a significant improvement
over the open cavity designs in the mean pressure distribution and sound pressure level distributions.

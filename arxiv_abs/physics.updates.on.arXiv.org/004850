Time-domain sampling of arbitrary electric fields with sub-cycle resolution enables a complete
time-frequency analysis of a system's response to electromagnetic illumination. This provides
access to dynamic information that is not provided by absorption spectra alone, and has recently
been shown through measurements in the infrared that time-domain optical-field sampling offers
significant improvements with regard to molecular sensitivity and limits of detection compared
to traditional spectroscopic methods. Despite the many scientific and technological motivations,
time-domain, optical-field sampling systems operating in the visible to near-infrared spectral
regions are seldom accessible, requiring large driving pulse energies, and large laser amplifier
systems, bulky apparatuses, and vacuum environments. Here, we demonstrate an all-on-chip, optoelectronic
device capable of sampling arbitrary, low-energy, near-infrared waveforms under ambient conditions.
Our solid-state integrated detector uses optical-field-driven electron emission from resonant
nanoantennas to achieve petahertz-level switching speeds by generating on-chip attosecond electron
bursts. These bursts are used to probe the electric field of weak optical transients. We demonstrated
our devices by sampling the electric field of a ~5 fJ, broadband near-infrared ultrafast laser pulse
using a ~50 pJ near-infrared driving pulse. Our sampling measurements recovered the weak optical
transient as well as localized plasmonic dynamics of the emitting nanoantennas $in~situ$. This
field-sampling device--with its compact footprint and low pulse-energy requirements--offers
opportunities in a variety of applications, including: broadband time-domain spectroscopy in
the molecular fingerprint region, time-domain analysis of nonlinear phenomena, and detailed
studies of strong-field light-matter interactions.

Deep learning is a potential approach to automatically develop kinetic models from experimental
data. We propose a deep neural network model of KiNet to represent chemical kinetics. KiNet takes
the current composition states and predicts the evolution of the states after a fixed time step.
The long-period evolution of the states and their gradients to model parameters can be efficiently
obtained by recursively applying the KiNet model multiple times. To address the challenges of the
high-dimensional composition space and error accumulation in long-period prediction, the architecture
of KiNet incorporates the residual network model (ResNet), and the training employs backpropagation
through time (BPTT) approach to minimize multi-step prediction error. In addition, an approach
for efficiently computing the gradient of the ignition delay time (IDT) to KiNet model parameters
is proposed to train the KiNet against the rich database of IDT from literature, which could address
the scarcity of time-resolved species measurements. The KiNet is first trained and compared with
the simulated species profiles during the auto-ignition of H2/air mixtures. The obtained KiNet
model can accurately predict the auto-ignition processes for various initial conditions that
cover a wide range of pressures, temperatures, and equivalence ratios. Then, we show that the gradient
of IDT to KiNet model parameters is parallel to the gradient of the temperature at the ignition point.
This correlation enables efficient computation of the gradient of IDT via backpropagation and
is demonstrated as a feasible approach for fine-tuning the KiNet against IDT. These demonstrations
shall open up the possibility of building data-driven kinetic models autonomously. Finally, the
trained KiNet could be potentially applied to kinetic model reduction and chemistry acceleration
in turbulent combustion simulations.

In the present study, we extend the \textit{consistency of mass conservation} and \textit{consistency
of mass and momentum transport} to multiphase flow problems including an arbitrary number of immiscible
and incompressible fluid phases. These two consistency conditions physically couple the Phase-Field
equation, which locates different phases, to the hydrodynamics, and lead to a momentum equation
that is Galilean invariant and compatible with kinetic energy conservation, regardless of the
details of the Phase-Field equation. After implementing these two consistency conditions, we
further illustrate that the 2nd law of thermodynamics and \textit{consistency of reduction} of
the entire multiphase model only rely on the properties of the Phase-Field equation. All the consistency
conditions are physically supported by the control volume analysis and mixture theory. Then, the
multiphase flow model is completed by selecting a reduction consistent Phase-Field equation.
Several new techniques are developed to preserve the physical properties of the model after discretization,
including the gradient-based phase selection procedure, the momentum conservative method for
the surface force, and the correspondences of numerical operators in the discrete Phase-Field
and momentum equations. Equipped with these novel techniques, the scheme is consistent and conservative
in the sense that it conserves the mass of each phase and momentum, guarantees the summation of the
volume fractions to be unity, and preserves all the consistency conditions, on the fully discrete
level and for an arbitrary number of phases. The properties of the scheme are all numerically validated.
Numerical applications show that the proposed model and scheme are robust and effective to study
complicated multiphase dynamics, especially for those including large-density ratios.

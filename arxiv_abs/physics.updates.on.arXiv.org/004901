We consider how chondrules, once-molten mm-sized spheres filling the oldest meteorites, may have
formed as the thermally processed fallout from planetesimal collisions in the primordial solar
nebula. We focus on the cloud of hot and dense silicate vapor released from a collision, and its expansion
into cold and rarefied nebular hydrogen. Collisional particle debris, including chondrule precursors,
are entrained by the cloud and melted by it, via gas conduction and radiation emitted by dust grains
that condense out of the cloud. Conduction and radiation lock vapor, dust, and proto-chondrules
to a common temperature, which falls as the cloud expands. Latent heat released by condensation
slows cooling at first, but eventually radiative losses hasten it so that all remaining vapor condenses,
leaving behind a pressure-less cavity which nebular gas backfills. Particles that are not too large
are swept back in; of these, those that are not too small can sediment at drag-limited terminal velocities
onto the planetesimal remains before solar tides tear them away. Particles that re-agglomerate
with their parent thus have a specific size range: $\sim$1 mm in the asteroid belt, and $\sim$10 $\mu$m
in the proto-Kuiper belt, for nebular densities comparable to the minimum-mass solar nebula. Thermal
histories of chondrules in asteroids, and chondrule-like particles in the short-period comet
81P/Wild-2, are reproduced for colliding planetesimals of order 100 km in radius, matching the
dominant sizes of Solar System minor bodies. If asteroids were born big and nebular gas densities
decayed monotonically, then our model predicts older chondrules have larger maximum sizes and
cooled more slowly. Problems, including the efficiency of chondrule production and the origin
of CAIs, are discussed.

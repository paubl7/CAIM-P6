While the advances in synchrotron light sources, together with the development of focusing optics
and detectors, allow nanoscale ptychographic imaging of materials and biological specimens,
the corresponding experiments can yield terabyte-scale large volumes of data that can impose a
heavy burden on the computing platform. While Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) provide high performance
for such large-scale ptychography datasets, a single GPU is typically insufficient for analysis
and reconstruction. Several existing works have considered leveraging multiple GPUs to accelerate
the ptychographic reconstruction. However, they utilize only Message Passing Interface (MPI)
to handle the communications between GPUs. It poses inefficiency for the configuration that has
multiple GPUs in a single node, especially while processing a single large projection, since it
provides no optimizations to handle the heterogeneous GPU interconnections containing both low-speed
links, e.g., PCIe, and high-speed links, e.g., NVLink. In this paper, we provide a multi-GPU implementation
that can effectively solve large-scale ptychographic reconstruction problem with optimized
performance on intra-node multi-GPU. We focus on the conventional maximum-likelihood reconstruction
problem using conjugate-gradient (CG) for the solution and propose a novel hybrid parallelization
model to address the performance bottlenecks in CG solver. Accordingly, we develop a tool called
PtyGer (Ptychographic GPU(multiple)-based reconstruction), implementing our hybrid parallelization
model design. The comprehensive evaluation verifies that PtyGer can fully preserve the original
algorithm's accuracy while achieving outstanding intra-node GPU scalability.

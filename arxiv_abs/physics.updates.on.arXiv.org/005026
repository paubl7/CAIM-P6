We conduct a systematic,direct-numerical-simulation study,in mathematical models for ventricular
tissue,of the dependence of spiral-and scroll-wave dynamics on $G_{Kr}$, the maximal conductance
of the delayed rectifier Potassium current($I_{Kr}$) channel,and the parameter $\gamma_{Cao}$,which
determines the magnitude and shape of the current $I_{CaL}$ for the L-type calcium-current channel,in
both square and anatomically realistic,whole-ventricle simulation domains using canine and
human models. We use ventricular geometry with fiber-orientation details and employ a physiologically
realistic model for a canine ventricular myocyte. We restrict ourselves to an HRD-model parameter
regime, which does not produce spiral- and scroll-wave instabilities because of other,well-studied
causes like a very sharp action-potential-duration-restitution (APDR) curve or early after depolarizations(EADs)
at the single-cell level. We find that spiral- or scroll-wave dynamics are affected predominantly
by a simultaneous change in $I_{CaL}$ and $I_{Kr}$,rather than by a change in any one of these currents;other
currents do not have such a large effect on these wave dynamics in this parameter regime of the HRD
model.We obtain stability diagrams in the $G_{Kr} -\gamma_{Cao}$ plane.In the 3D domain,the geometry
of the domain supports the confinement of the scroll waves and makes them more stable compared to
their spiral-wave counterparts in 2D domain. We have also carried out a comparison of our HRD results
with their counterparts for the human-ventricular TP06 model and have found important differences.
In both these models,to make a transition,(from broken-wave to stable-scroll states or vice versa)
we must simultaneously increase $I_{Kr}$ and decrease $I_{CaL}$;a modification of only one of
these currents is not enough to effect this transition.

Cellular appendages conferring motility, such as flagella or cilia, are known to synchronise their
periodic beats. The origin of synchronisation is a combination of long-range hydrodynamic interactions
with physical mechanisms allowing the phases of these biological oscillators to evolve. Two of
such mechanisms have been identified by previous work, the elastic compliance of the periodic orbit
or oscillations driven by phase-dependent biological forcing. To help uncover the physical mechanism
for hydrodynamic synchronisation most essential overall in biology, we theoretically investigate
the effect of strong confinement on the effectiveness of hydrodynamic synchronisation. We use
minimal models where appendages are modelled as rigid spheres forced to move along circular trajectories
near a rigid surface. Strong confinement is modelled by adding a second nearby surface, parallel
to the first one, where the distance between the surfaces is much smaller than the typical distance
between the cilia. We calculate separately the impact of confinement on the synchronisation dynamics
of the elastic compliance and the force modulation mechanisms and compare our results to the case
with no confinement. Applying our results to the biologically-relevant situation of nodal cilia,
we show that force modulation is a mechanism that leads to phase-locked states under strong confinement
that are very similar to those without confinement as a difference with the elastic compliance mechanism.
Our results point therefore to the robustness of force modulation for synchronisation, an important
feature for biological dynamics that suggests it could be the most essential physical mechanism
overall in arrays of nodal cilia. We further examine the distinct situation of primary cilia and
show in that case that the difference in robustness of the mechanisms is not as pronounced but still
favours the force modulation.

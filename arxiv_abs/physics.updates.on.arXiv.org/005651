Hypergraphs are a natural modeling paradigm for a wide range of complex relational systems with
multibody interactions. A standard analysis task is to identify clusters of closely related or
densely interconnected nodes. While many probabilistic generative models for graph clustering
have been proposed, there are relatively few such models for hypergraphs. We propose a Poisson degree-corrected
hypergraph stochastic blockmodel (DCHSBM), an expressive generative model of clustered hypergraphs
with heterogeneous node degrees and edge sizes. Maximum-likelihood inference in the DCHSBM naturally
leads to a clustering objective that generalizes the popular modularity objective for graphs.
We derive a general Louvain-type algorithm for this objective, as well as a a faster, specialized
"All-Or-Nothing" (AON) variant in which edges are expected to lie fully within clusters. This special
case encompasses a recent proposal for modularity in hypergraphs, while also incorporating flexible
resolution and edge-size parameters. We show that hypergraph Louvain is highly scalable, including
as an example an experiment on a synthetic hypergraph of one million nodes. We also demonstrate through
synthetic experiments that the detectability regimes for hypergraph community detection differ
from methods based on dyadic graph projections. In particular, there are regimes in which hypergraph
methods can recover planted partitions even though graph based methods necessarily fail due to
information-theoretic limits. We use our model to analyze different patterns of higher-order
structure in school contact networks, U.S. congressional bill cosponsorship, U.S. congressional
committees, product categories in co-purchasing behavior, and hotel locations from web browsing
sessions, that it is able to recover ground truth clusters in empirical data sets exhibiting the
corresponding higher-order structure.

Thermal energy storage (TES) is increasingly recognized as an essential component of efficient
Combined Heat and Power (CHP), Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning
(HVAC), and refrigeration as it reduces peak demand while helping to manage intermittent availability
of energy (e.g., from solar or wind). Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage (LHTES) is a viable option
because of its high energy storage density. Parametric analysis of LHTES heat exchangers have been
focused on obtaining data with laminar flow in the phase changing fluid and then fitting a functional
form, such as a power law or polynomial, to those data. Alternatively, in this paper we present a parametric
framework to analyze LHTES devices by identifying all relevant fluid parameters and corresponding
dimensionless numbers. We present 64 simulations of an LHTES device using the finite volume method
at four values of the Grashof, Prandtl and Reynolds numbers in the phase change material (PCM) and
heat transfer fluid (HTF). We observe that with sufficient energy available in the HTF, the effects
of the HTF Reynolds number and Prandtl number on the heat transfer rate are negligible. Under these
conditions, we propose a time scale for the variation of energy stored (or melt fraction) of the LHTES
device based on the Fourier number($Fo$), Grashof number($Gr_p$) and Prandtl number($Pr_p$)
and observe a $Gr_p^1$ and $Pr_p^{(1/3)}$ dependency. We also identify two distinct regions in
the variation of the melt fraction with time, namely, the linear and the asymptotic region. We also
predict the critical value of the melt fraction at the transition between the two regions. From these
analyses, we draw some conclusions regarding the design procedure for LHTES devices.

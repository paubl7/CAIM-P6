Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are lethal rhythm disorders,
which are associated with the occurrence of abnormal electrical scroll waves in the heart. Given
the technical limitations of imaging and probing, the in situ visualization of these waves inside
cardiac tissue remains a challenge. Therefore, we must, perforce, rely on in-silico simulations
of scroll waves in mathematical models for cardiac tissue to develop an understanding of the dynamics
of these waves in mammalian hearts. We use direct numerical simulations of the Hund-Rudy-Dynamic
(HRD) model, for canine ventricular tissue, to examine the interplay between electrical scroll-waves
and conduction and ionic inhomogeneities, in anatomically realistic canine ventricular geometries
with muscle-fiber architecture. We find that millimeter-sized, distributed, conduction inhomogeneities
cause a substantial decrease in the scroll wavelength, thereby increasing the probability for
wave breaks; by contrast, single, localized, medium-sized ($\simeq $ cm) conduction inhomogeneities,
exhibit the potential to suppress wave breaks or enable the self-organization of wave fragments
into stable, intact scrolls. We show that ionic inhomogeneities, both distributed or localised,
suppress scroll-wave break up. The dynamics of a stable rotating wave is not affected significantly
by such inhomogeneities, except at high concentrations of distributed inhomogeneities, which
can cause a partial break up of scroll waves. Our results indicate that inhomogeneities in the canine
ventricular tissue are less arrhythmogenic than inhomogeneities in porcine ventricular tissue,
for which an earlier in silico study has shown that the inhomogeneity-induced suppression of scroll
waves is a rare occurrence.

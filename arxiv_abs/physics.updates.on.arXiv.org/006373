Strain-mediated multiferroic composite structures are gaining scientific and technological
attractions because of the promise of low power consumption and greater flexibility in material
and geometry choices. In here, the direct magnetoelectric coupling coefficient (DME) of composite
multiferroic cylinders, consisted of two mechanically bonded concentric cylinders, was analytically
modeled under the influence of a radially emanating magnetic field. The analysis framework emphasized
the effects of shear lag and demagnetization on the overall performance. The shear lag effect was
analytically proven to have no bearing on the DME since it has no effect on the induced radial displacement
due to the conditions imposed on the composite cylinder. The demagnetization effect was also thoroughly
considered as a function of the imposed mechanical boundary conditions, geometrical dimensions
of the composite cylinder, and the introduction of a thin elastic layer at the interface between
the inner piezomagnetic and outer piezoelectric cylinders. The results indicate that the demagnetization
effect adversely impacted the DME coefficient between 70% and 86%. In a trial to compensate for the
reduction in peak DME coefficient due to the presence of demagnetization, non-dimensional geometrical
analysis was carried out to identify the geometrical attributes corresponding to the maximum DME.
It was observed that the peak DME coefficient is nearly unaffected by varying the inner radius of
the composite cylinder, while it approaches its maximum value when the thickness of the piezoelectric
cylinder is almost 60% of the total thickness of the composite cylinder. The latter conclusion was
true for all of the considered boundary conditions.

Low-order thermoacoustic models are qualitatively correct, but they are typically quantitatively
inaccurate. We propose a time-domain method to make qualitatively low-order models quantitatively
(more) accurate. First, we develop a Bayesian data assimilation method for a low-order model to
self-adapt and self-correct any time that reference data, for example from experiments, becomes
available. Second, we apply the methodology to infer the thermoacoustic states, heat release parameters,
and model errors on the fly without storing data (real-time). Third, we analyse the performance
of the data assimilation with synthetic data and interpret the results physically. We apply the
data assimilation algorithm to all nonlinear thermoacoustic regimes, from limit cycles to chaos,
in which acoustic pressure measurements from microphones are assimilated. Fourth, we propose
practical rules for thermoacoustic data assimilation based on physical observations on the dynamics.
An increase, reject, inflate strategy is proposed to deal with the rich nonlinear behaviour, the
bifurcations of which are sensitive to small perturbations to the parameters. We show that (i) the
correct acoustic pressure and parameters can be accurately inferred; (ii) the learning is robust
because it can tackle large uncertainties in the observations (up to 50% the mean values); (iii)
the uncertainty of the prediction and parameters is naturally part of the output; and (iv) both the
time-accurate solution and statistics can be successfully inferred. Physical time scales for
assimilation are proposed in non-chaotic regimes (with the Nyquist-Shannon criterion) and in
chaotic regimes (with the Lyapunov time). Data assimilation opens up new possibility for real--time
prediction of thermoacoustics by synergistically combining physical knowledge and data.

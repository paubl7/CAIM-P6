We develop a passive control strategy for suppressing thermoacoustic instability in a bluff-body
stabilized premixed turbulent combustor. When the equivalence ratio is varied, there is a transition
from combustion noise to thermoacoustic instability via intermittency in the combustor. We perform
simultaneous acoustic pressure, 2D-PIV, and CH$^*$ chemiluminescence measurements to capture
the pressure fluctuations, the velocity field, and the heat release rate (HRR) field during the
transition. We measure the spatial distribution of the amplitude of turbulent velocity at the acoustic
frequency, time-averaged vorticity, time-averaged HRR, and Rayleigh index and identify various
regions of significance. We implement a passive control strategy by targeting these regions with
a steady injection of secondary micro-jet of air to optimize the injection location and determine
the critical region. Targeting the critical region with secondary air leads to greater than 20 dB
suppression of the dominant thermoacoustic mode. We observe that the coherent structure forming
from the shear layer following the dump plane gets suppressed, leading to an incoherent spatial
distribution of HRR fluctuations. We find that the turbulent velocity amplitude correctly identifies
the critical region for optimized passive control during thermoacoustic instability. In contrast,
the Rayleigh index identifies the region of the most significant acoustic driving; however, it
does not identify the region most sensitive to control. Finally, we extend our analysis by determining
the spatial distribution of the Hurst exponent measured from the turbulent velocity field. We show
that the Hurst exponent identifies the critical region during thermoacoustic instability and
intermittency, unlike the other physical measures.

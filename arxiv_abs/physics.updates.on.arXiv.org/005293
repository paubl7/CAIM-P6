Seismic observations of a slowdown in P wave velocity at the base of Earth's outer core suggest the
presence of a stably-stratified region known as the F-layer. This raises an important question:
how can the light elements that drive the geodynamo pass through the stably-stratified layer without
disturbing it? We consider the F-layer as a slurry containing solid particles dispersed within
the liquid iron alloy that snow under gravity towards the inner core. We present a regime diagram
that establishes how slurry F-layer dynamics change as key control parameters vary. The key dimensionless
parameters are the P\'eclet number ($Pe$), the ratio between advection and chemical diffusion;
Stefan number ($St$), the ratio between sensible and latent heat; and Lewis number ($Le$), the ratio
between thermal and chemical diffusivity. We obtain three dynamical regimes corresponding to
stable, partially stable, and unstable slurries. No slurry is found when the heat flow at the base
of the layer exceeds the heat flow at the top, and a stably-stratified slurry arises when advection
overcomes thermal diffusion ($Pe \gtrsim Le$). Increasing $St$ stabilises the slurry by promoting
crystallisation in the turbulent mixing sublayer at the top of the F-layer, and a higher $Pe$ slurry
increases the degree of stratification. A stably-stratified F-layer favours a $\Delta \rho_\textrm{bod}$
that is constrained to approximately 500 $\mathrm{kg} \ \mathrm{m}^{-3}$ in the high $Le$ case,
whereas in the low $Le$ case there is a greater spread in $\Delta \rho_\textrm{bod}$ that is amenable
to the lower extreme allowed by the seismic observations. In both cases the slurry model is opposed
to higher values of $\Delta \rho_\textrm{bod}$ recommended by the observations. The model favours
a high thermal conductivity that predicts an inner core age between 0.6 and 1.2 $Ga$, consistent
with estimates from the literature.

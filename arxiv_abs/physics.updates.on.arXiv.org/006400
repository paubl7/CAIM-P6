We present a numerical study to investigate the fluid-structure interaction of a flexible circular
cantilever cylinder in a uniform cross-flow. We employ a fully-coupled fluid-structure solver
based on the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.
We examine the dynamics of the cylinder for a wide range of reduced velocities ($U^*$), mass ratios
($m^*$), and Reynolds numbers ($Re$). Of particular interest is to explore the possibility of flow-induced
vibrations in a slender cantilever cylinder of aspect ratio $AR=100$ at laminar subcritical $Re$
regime (i.e., no periodic vortex shedding). We assess the extent to which such a flexible cylindrical
beam can sustain flow-induced vibrations and characterize the contribution of the beam's flexibility
to the stability of the wake at low $Re$. We show that when certain conditions are satisfied, the flexible
cantilever cylinder undergoes sustained large-amplitude vibrations. The frequency of the oscillations
is found to match the frequency of the periodic fluid forces for a particular range of system parameters.
In this range, the frequency of the transverse vibrations is shown to match the first-mode natural
frequency of the cylinder, indicating the existence of the lock-in phenomenon. The range of the
lock-in regime is shown to have a strong dependence on $Re$ and $m^*$. We discover that unlike the
steady wake behind a stationary rigid cylinder, the wake of a low mass ratio flexible cantilever
cylinder could lose its stability in the lock-in regime at Reynolds numbers as low as $Re=22$. A combined
VIV-galloping type instability is shown to be the possible cause of the wake instability at this
$Re$ regime. These findings attempt to generalize our understanding of the flow-induced vibrations
in flexible cantilever structures and can have a profound impact on the development of novel flow-measurement
sensors.

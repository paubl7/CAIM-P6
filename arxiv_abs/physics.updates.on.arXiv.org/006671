Geometric mechanics is a branch of mathematical physics that studies classical mechanics of particles
and fields from the point of view of geometry. In a geometric language, symmetries can be expressed
in a natural manner as vector fields that generate the corresponding symmetry group. Moreover,
with the geometric machinery, the phase space of a mechanical system with symmetries can be reduced
to a space with less dimensions. As it is well-known, non-conservative forces cannot be written
as the gradient of a potential, so they cannot be absorbed in the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian. The description
of a mechanical system subject to a non-conservative force requires an external force together
with the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian function. In addition, external forces emerge for the description
of certain systems with non-holonomic constraints. In this master's thesis, autonomous Hamiltonian
and Lagrangian systems are studied in the framework of symplectic geometry. After introducing
the geometric tools that will be employed, several results regarding symmetries and constants
of the motion are reviewed. The method of symplectic reduction for systems with symmetry is also
presented. In a second part, non-conservative systems are presented in a geometric language. A
Noether's theorem for Lagrangian systems subject to external forces is obtained. Other results
regarding symmetries and constants of the motion are derived as well. Furthermore, a theory for
the reduction of forced Lagrangian systems invariant under the action of a Lie group is presented.
These results are particularized for the so-called Rayleigh dissipation, that is, external forces
that can be written as the derivative of a "potential" with respect to the velocities.

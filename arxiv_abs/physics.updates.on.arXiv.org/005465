Three-dimensional (3D) instabilities on a (potentially turbulent) two-dimensional (2D) flow
are still incompletely understood, despite recent progress. Here we propose a simple energy-conserving
model of a regularised 2D point-vortex flow coupled to localised 3D perturbations ("ergophages"),
such that ergophages can gain energy by altering vortex-vortex distances through an induced divergent
velocity field, thus decreasing point vortex energy. We investigate the model in three distinct
stages of evolution: (i) The linear regime, where the amplitude of the ergophages grows or decays
exponentially on average, with an instantaneous growth rate that fluctuates randomly in time.
The instantaneous growth rate has a small auto-correlation time, and a probability distribution
featuring a power-law tail with exponent between -2 and -5/3 (up to a cut-off) depending on the background
state of the point-vortex flow. Consequently, the logarithm of the ergophage amplitude performs
a free L\'evy flight. (ii) The passive-nonlinear regime of the model, where the 2D flow evolves independently
of the ergophage amplitudes, which saturate by non-linear self-interactions without affecting
the 2D flow. In this regime the system exhibits a new type of on-off intermittency that we name L\'evy
on-off intermittency, which we define and study in a companion paper. We compute the bifurcation
diagram for the mean and variance of the perturbation amplitude, as well as the probability density
of the perturbation amplitude. (iii) Finally, we characterise the the fully nonlinear regime,
where ergophages feed back on the 2D flow, and study how the vortex temperature is altered by the interaction
with ergophages. It is shown that when the amplitude of the ergophages is sufficiently large, the
2D flow saturates to a zero-temperature state. Given the limitations of existing theories, our
model provides a new perspective ...

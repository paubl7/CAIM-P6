We investigate how collective behaviors of vibrations such as cooperativity and interference
can enhance energy transfer in a nontrivial way, focusing on an example of a donor-bridge-acceptor
trimeric chromophore system coupled to two vibrational degrees of freedom. Employing parameters
selected to provide an overall uphill energy transfer from donor to acceptor, we use numerical calculations
of dynamics in a coupled exciton-vibration basis, together with perturbation-based analytics
and calculation of vibronic spectra, we identify clear spectral features of single- and multi-phonon
vibrationally-assisted energy transfer (VAET) dynamics, where the latter include up to six-phonon
contributions. We identify signatures of vibrational cooperation and interference that provide
enhancement of energy transfer relative to that obtained from VAET with a single vibrational mode.
We observe a phononic analogue of two-photon absorption, as well as a novel heteroexcitation mechanism
in which a single phonon gives rise to simultaneous excitation of both the trimeric system and the
vibrational degrees of freedom. The impact of vibrations and of the one- and two-phonon VAET processes
on the energy transfer are seen to be quite different in the weak and strong site-vibration coupling
regimes. In the weak coupling regime, two-phonon processes dominate, whereas in the strong coupling
regime up to six-phonon VAET processes can be induced. The VAET features are seen to be enhanced with
increasing temperature and site-vibration coupling strength, and are reduced in the presence
of dissipation. We analyze the dependence of these phenomena on the explicit form of the chromophore-vibration
couplings, with comparison of VAET spectra for local and non-local couplings.

Cathodes are critical components of rechargeable batteries. Conventionally, the search for cathode
materials relies on experimental trial-and-error and a traversing of existing computational/experimental
databases. While these methods have led to the discovery of several commercially-viable cathode
materials, the chemical space explored so far is limited and many phases will have been overlooked,
in particular those that are metastable. We describe a computational framework for battery cathode
exploration, based on ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS), an approach that samples local
minima on the potential energy surface to identify new crystal structures. We show that, by delimiting
the search space using a number of constraints, including chemically aware minimum interatomic
separations, cell volumes, and space group symmetries, AIRSS can efficiently predict both thermodynamically
stable and metastable cathode materials. Specifically, we investigate LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and LixCuyFz
to demonstrate the efficiency of the method by rediscovering the known crystal structures of these
cathode materials. The effect of parameters, such as minimum separations and symmetries, on the
efficiency of the sampling is discussed in detail. The adaptation of the minimum interatomic distances,
on a species-pair basis, from low-energy optimized structures to efficiently capture the local
coordination environment of atoms, is explored. A family of novel cathode materials based, on the
transition-metal oxalates,is proposed. They demonstrate superb energy density, oxygen-redox
stability, and lithium diffusion properties. This article serves both as an introduction to the
computational framework, and as a guide to battery cathode material discovery using AIRSS.

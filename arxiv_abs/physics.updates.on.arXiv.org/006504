Magnetization dynamics in magnetic materials is modeled by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG)
equation. In the LLG equation, the length of magnetization is conserved and the system energy is
dissipative. Implicit and semi-implicit schemes have been used in micromagnetics simulations
due to their unconditional numerical stability. In more details, implicit schemes preserve the
properties of the LLG equation, but solve a nonlinear system of equations per time step. In contrast,
semi-implicit schemes only solve a linear system of equations, while additional operations are
needed to preserve the length of magnetization. It still remains unclear which one shall be used
if both implicit and semi-implicit schemes are available. In this work, using the implicit Crank-Nicolson
(ICN) scheme as a benchmark, we propose to make this implicit scheme semi-implicit. It can be proved
that both schemes are second-order accurate in space and time. For the unique solvability of nonlinear
systems of equations in the ICN scheme, we require that the temporal step size scales quadratically
with the spatial mesh size. It is numerically verified that the convergence of the nonlinear solver
becomes slower for larger temporal step size and multiple magnetization profiles are obtained
for different initial guesses. The linear systems of equations in the semi-implicit CN (SICN) scheme
are unconditionally uniquely solvable, and the condition that the temporal step size scales linearly
with the spatial mesh size is needed in the convergence of the SICN scheme. In terms of numerical efficiency,
the SICN scheme achieves the same accuracy as the ICN scheme with less computational time. Based
on these results, we conclude that a semi-implicit scheme is superior to its implicit analog both
theoretically and numerically, and we recommend the semi-implicit scheme in micromagnetics simulations
if both methods are available.

Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is an imaging approach for modeling velocity structure by minimizing
the misfit between recorded and predicted seismic waveforms. The strong non-linearity of FWI resulting
from fitting oscillatory waveforms can trap the optimization in local minima. We propose a neural-network-based
full waveform inversion method (NNFWI) that integrates deep neural networks with FWI by representing
the velocity model with a generative neural network. Neural networks can naturally introduce spatial
correlations as regularization to the generated velocity model, which suppresses noise in the
gradients and mitigates local minima. The velocity model generated by neural networks is input
to the same partial differential equation (PDE) solvers used in conventional FWI. The gradients
of both the neural networks and PDEs are calculated using automatic differentiation, which back-propagates
gradients through the acoustic/elastic PDEs and neural network layers to update the weights and
biases of the generative neural network. Experiments on 1D velocity models, the Marmousi model,
and the 2004 BP model demonstrate that NNFWI can mitigate local minima, especially for imaging high
contrast features like salt bodies, and significantly improves the inversion in the presence of
noise. Adding dropout layers to the neural network model also allows analyzing the uncertainty
of the inversion results through Monte Carlo dropout. NNFWI opens a new pathway to combine deep learning
and FWI for exploiting both the characteristics of deep neural networks and the high accuracy of
PDE solvers. Because NNFWI does not require extra training data and optimization loops, it provides
an attractive and straightforward alternative to conventional FWI.

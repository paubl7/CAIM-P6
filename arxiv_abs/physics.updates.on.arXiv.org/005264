The current resurgence in the phase diagram study beyond the critical point has questioned the conventional
belief of supercritical fluid as a single phase with varying properties. On the same line, a novel
two-phase approach has been proposed to study the supercritical flow with heat transfer deterioration
(HTD) phenomena. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) multiphase model has been used to analyze the flow, and
the simulation result reasonably predicts the wall temperature peaks. Moreover, the velocity
and turbulent kinetic energy profiles for different axial locations explain the occurrence of
HTD, and it is on par with the pre-existing numerical method. Besides, the quantitative analysis
presented in the paper expounds on qualitative understanding. The parametric study of the thermophysical
properties revealed that the density variation is the primary cause of HTD in supercritical flows.
So banking on this conclusion, the propounded study focuses on the forces generated due to the density
variation. This technique equips us with a holistic picture of the supercritical flows. It leads
to the inference that for no HTD effects to be present, buoyancy and inertia forces have to be of comparable
magnitude throughout the flow. In addition, the pseudo phase change model outclasses the existing
research by rendering us the volume fraction data. Mapping of this variable reveals a sudden jump
in the lighter phase's thickness near the wall at the site of HTD, which is also reflected as a maximum
in the nondimensional two-phase thickness (P) plot. Nevertheless, this observation is only restricted
to HTD caused by buoyancy. In the end, a theoretical expression has been conceptualized for computing
the two-phase thickness (h) value, which can serve as a fundamental length scale in supercritical
flows as it marks the region of highest property gradient near the wall.

Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulence in complex geometries is often conducted using discretizations
with highly inhomogeneous resolution. The issues associated with resolution inhomogeneity are
related to the noncommutativity of the filtering and differentiation operators, which introduces
a commutation term into the governing equations. Neglect of this commutation term gives rise to
commutation error. While the commutation error is well recognized, it is often ignored in practice.
Moreover, the commutation error related to the implicit filter (i.e., projection onto the underlying
discretization) has not been well investigated. Modeling of the commutation term that arises from
the noncommutativity between numerical projection and differentiation is crucial for correcting
errors induced by resolution inhomogeneity in practical LES settings, which typically rely solely
on implicit filtering. Here, we investigate how this implicit commutation error manifests in simulation
and demonstrate its impact on the convection of a packet of homogeneous isotropic turbulence through
an inhomogeneous grid. A connection is made between the implicit commutation error and the propagation
properties of the underlying numerics. We also introduce a statistical description of the commutation
term that can be used in situ to determine the importance of the commutator relative to the subgrid
stress term. A model is proposed for the correction of these issues in the case considered here, which
highlights several important characteristics of commutation modeling for LES and the importance
of considering numerical properties during the formulation of LES models in general. Several insights
are discussed that could also be applied to other issues in LES, such as discretization error.

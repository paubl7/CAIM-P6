We address a challenge of active flow control: the optimization of many actuation parameters guaranteeing
fast convergence and avoiding suboptimal local minima. This challenge is addressed by a new optimizer,
called explorative gradient method (EGM). EGM alternatively performs one exploitive downhill
simplex step and an explorative Latin hypercube sampling iteration. Thus, the convergence rate
of a gradient based method is guaranteed while, at the same time, better minima are explored. For
an analytical multi-modal test function, EGM is shown to significantly outperform the downhill
simplex method, the random restart variant, Latin hypercube sampling, Monte Carlo iterations
and the genetic algorithm. EGM is applied to minimize the net drag power of the two-dimensional fluidic
pinball benchmark with three cylinder rotations as actuation parameters. The net drag power is
reduced by $40\%$ employing direct numerical simulations at a Reynolds number of $100$ based on
the cylinder diameter. This optimal actuation leads to $98\%$ drag reduction employing Coanda
forcing for boat tailing and partial stabilization of vortex shedding. The price is an actuation
energy corresponding to $58\%$ of the unforced parasitic drag power. EGM is also used to minimize
drag of the $35^\circ$ slanted Ahmed body employing distributed steady blowing with 10 inputs.
$17\%$ drag reduction are achieved using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations (RANS)
at the Reynolds number $Re_H=1.9 \times 10^5$ based on the height of the Ahmed body. The optimal actuation
emulates boat tailing by inward-directed blowing with velocities which are comparable to the oncoming
velocity. We expect that EGM will be employed as efficient optimizer in many future active flow control
plants.

The recently proposed high-order TENO scheme [Fu et al., Journal of Computational Physics, 305,
pp.333-359] has shown great potential in predicting complex fluids owing to the novel weighting
strategy, which ensures the high-order accuracy, the low numerical dissipation, and the sharp
shock-capturing capability. However, the applications are still restricted to simple geometries
with Cartesian or curvilinear meshes. In this work, a new class of high-order shock-capturing TENO
schemes for unstructured meshes are proposed. Similar to the standard TENO schemes and some variants
of WENO schemes, the candidate stencils include one large stencil and several small third-order
stencils. Following a strong scale-separation procedure, a tailored novel ENO-like stencil selection
strategy is proposed such that the high-order accuracy is restored in smooth regions by selecting
the candidate reconstruction on the large stencil while the ENO property is enforced near discontinuities
by adopting the candidate reconstruction from smooth small stencils. The nonsmooth stencils containing
genuine discontinuities are explicitly excluded from the final reconstruction, leading to excellent
numerical stability. Different from the WENO concept, such unique sharp stencil selection retains
the low numerical dissipation without sacrificing the shock-capturing capability. The newly
proposed framework enables arbitrarily high-order TENO reconstructions on unstructured meshes.
For conceptual verification, the TENO schemes with third- to sixth-order accuracy are constructed.
Without parameter tuning case by case, the performance of the proposed TENO schemes is demonstrated
by examining a set of benchmark cases with broadband flow length scales.

In the past couple of years, there is a proliferation in the use of machine learning approaches to
represent subgrid scale processes in geophysical flows with an aim to improve the forecasting capability
and to accelerate numerical simulations of these flows. Despite its success for different types
of flow, the online deployment of a data-driven closure model can cause instabilities and biases
in modeling the overall effect of subgrid scale processes, which in turn leads to inaccurate prediction.
To tackle this issue, we exploit the data assimilation technique to correct the physics-based model
coupled with the neural network as a surrogate for unresolved flow dynamics in multiscale systems.
In particular, we use a set of neural network architectures to learn the correlation between resolved
flow variables and the parameterizations of unresolved flow dynamics and formulate a data assimilation
approach to correct the hybrid model during their online deployment. We illustrate our framework
in a set of applications of the multiscale Lorenz 96 system for which the parameterization model
for unresolved scales is exactly known, and the two-dimensional Kraichnan turbulence system for
which the parameterization model for unresolved scales is not known a priori. Our analysis, therefore,
comprises a predictive dynamical core empowered by (i) a data-driven closure model for subgrid
scale processes, (ii) a data assimilation approach for forecast error correction, and (iii) both
data-driven closure and data assimilation procedures. We show significant improvement in the
long-term prediction of the underlying chaotic dynamics with our framework compared to using only
neural network parameterizations for future prediction.

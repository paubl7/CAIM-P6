Significance: Histopathological analysis of tissues is an essential tool for grading, staging,
diagnosing and resecting cancers and other malignancies. Current histopathological techniques
require substantial sample processing prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) dyes,
to highlight nuclear and cellular morphology. Sample preparation and staining is resource-intensive
and introduces potential for variability during sample preparation. Aim: We present a novel method
for direct label-free histopathological assessment of formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue
blocks and thin tissue sections using a dual contrast photoacoustic remote sensing (PARS) microscopy
system. Approach: To emulate the nuclear and cellular contrast of H&E staining, we leverage unique
properties of the PARS system. Here the ultraviolet excitation of the PAARS microscope takes advantage
of DNA's unique optical absorption to provide nuclear contrast analogous to hematoxylin staining
of cell nucelli. Concurrently, the optical scattering contrast of the PARS detection system is
leveraged to provide bulk tissue contrast analogous to eosin staining of cell membranes. Results:
We demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by imaging human breast tissue and human skin tissues
in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks and frozen sections respectively. Salient nuclear
and extra-nuclear features such as cancerous cells, glands and ducts, adipocytes, and stromal
structures such as collagen. Conclusions. The presented dual contrast PARS microscope enables
label-free visualizations of tissue with contrast and quality analogous to the current gold standard
for histopathological analysis. Thus, the proposed system is well positioned to augment existing
histopathological workflows, providing histological imaging directly on unstained tissue blocks
and sections.

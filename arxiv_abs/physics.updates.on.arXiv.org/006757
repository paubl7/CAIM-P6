Buoyant shear layers are encountered in many engineering and environmental applications and have
been studied by researchers in the context of experiments and modeling for decades. Often, these
flows have high Reynolds and Richardson numbers, and this leads to significant/intractable space-time
resolution requirements for DNS or LES modeling. On the other hand, many of the important physical
mechanisms in these systems, such as stress anisotropy, wake stabilization, and regime transition,
inherently render eddy viscosity-based RANS modeling inappropriate. Accordingly, we pursue
second-moment closure (SMC), i.e., full Reynolds stress/flux/variance modeling, for moderate
Reynolds number non-stratified and stratified shear layers for which DNS is possible. A range of
sub-model complexity is pursued for the diffusion of stresses, density fluxes and variance, pressure
strain and scrambling, and dissipation. These sub-models are evaluated in terms of how well they
are represented by DNS in comparison to the exact Reynolds averaged terms, and how well they impact
the accuracy of the full RANS closure. For the non-stratified case, the SMC model predicts the shear
layer growth rate and Reynolds shear stress profiles accurately. Stress anisotropy and budgets
are captured only qualitatively. Comparing DNS of exact and modeled terms, inconsistencies in
model performance and assumptions are observed, including inaccurate prediction of individual
statistics, non-negligible pressure diffusion, and dissipation anisotropy. For the stratified
case, shear layer and gradient Richardson number growth rates, and stress, flux, and variance decay
rates, are captured with less accuracy than corresponding flow parameters in the non-stratified
case. These studies lead to several recommendations for model improvement.

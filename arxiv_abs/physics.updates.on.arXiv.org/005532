The management of the anthropogenic water cycle must ensure the preservation of the quality and
quantity of water resources and their careful allocation to the different uses. Protection of water
resources requires the control of pollution sources that may deteriorate them. This is a challenging
task in multi-stressed catchments. This work presents an approach that combines pesticide occurrence
patterns and stable isotope analyses of nitrogen (delta15N-NO3-, delta15N-NH4+), oxygen (delta18O-NO3-),
and boron (delta11B) to discriminate the origin of pesticides and nitrogenpollution to tackle
this challenge. The approach has been applied to a Mediterranean subcatchment subject to a variety
of natural and anthropogenic pressures. Combining the results from both analytical approaches
in selected locations of the basin, the urban/industrial activity was identified as the main pressure
on the quality of the surface water resources, and to a large extent also on the groundwater resources,
although agriculture may play also an important role, mainly in terms of nitrate and ammonium pollution.
Total pesticide concentrations in surface waters were one order of magnitude higher than in groundwaters
and believed to originate mainly from soil and/or sediments desorption processes and urban and
industrial use, as they were mainly associated with treated wastewaters. These findings are supported
by the stable isotope results, that pointed to an organic origin of nitrate in surface waters and
most groundwater samples. Ammonium pollution observed in some aquifer locations is probably generated
by nitrate reduction. Overall, no significant attenuation processes could be inferred for nitrate
pollution. The approach presented here exemplifies the investigative monitoring envisioned
in the Water Framework Directive.

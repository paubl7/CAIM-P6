In this paper, we study the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) of a three-dimensional (3D) flexible
membrane immersed in an unsteady separated flow at moderate Reynolds numbers. We employ a body-conforming
variational FSI solver based on the recently developed partitioned iterative scheme for the coupling
of turbulent fluid flow with nonlinear structural dynamics. Of particular interest is to understand
the flow-excited instability of a 3D flexible membrane as a function of the non-dimensional mass
ratio, Reynolds number and aeroelastic number. For a wide range of the parameters, we examine two
distinctive stability regimes of fluid-membrane interaction: deformed-steady state (DSS) and
dynamic balance state (DBS). We propose stability phase diagrams to demarcate the DSS and DBS regimes
for the parameter space of mass ratio vs. Reynolds number and mass ratio vs. aeroelastic number.
Based on the aeroelastic mode analysis, we observe a frequency synchronization between the vortex
shedding frequency and the membrane vibration frequency which leads to self-sustained vibrations
in the dynamic balance state. To characterize the origin of the frequency lock-in, we derive an approximate
analytical formula for the nonlinear natural frequency by considering the added mass effect and
employing a large deflection theory for a simply supported rectangular membrane. Through our systematic
high-fidelity numerical investigation, we find that the onset of the membrane vibration and the
mode transition has a dependence on the frequency lock-in between the natural frequency of the tensioned
membrane and the vortex shedding frequency or its harmonics. These findings on the fluid-elastic
instability of membranes have implications for the design and development of control strategies
for membrane wing-based unmanned systems and drones.

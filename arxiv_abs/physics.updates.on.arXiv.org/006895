There is considerable interest in the application of quantum information science to advance computations
in plasma physics. Many of the topics in fusion plasma physics are classical in nature. In order to
implement them on quantum computers it will require couching a classical problem in the language
of quantum mechanics. Electromagnetic waves are routinely used in fusion experiments. The propagation
of electromagnetic waves is described by Maxwell equations with an appropriate description of
the plasma as a dielectric medium. Before advancing to the tensor dielectric of a magnetized plasma,
this paper considers wave propagation in a one-dimensional inhomogeneous scalar dielectric.
The classic theory of scattering of plane electromagnetic waves at a planar interface, separating
two different dielectric media, leads to Fresnel equations for reflection and transmission coefficients.
In contrast to plane waves, this paper is on the reflection and transmission of a spatially confined
electromagnetic pulse. An analytical formulation for the scattering of a Gaussian pulse shows
that the maximum transmission coefficient is modified by the square-root of the ratio of the two
permittivities. The theory is complemented by numerical simulations using a quantum lattice algorithm
for Maxwell equations. The algorithm, based on the Riemann-Silberstein-Weber representation
of the electromagnetic fields and expressed in term of qubits, is an interleaved sequence of entangling
operators at each lattice site and unitary streaming operators which transmit information from
one site to an adjacent lattice site. Besides substantiating results from the theory for Gaussian
pulses, numerical simulations show their validity for non-Gaussian pulses.

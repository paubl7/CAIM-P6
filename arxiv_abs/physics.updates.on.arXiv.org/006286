A new variational theory is presented for beam loading in microwave cavities. The beam--field interaction
is formulated as a dynamical interaction whose stationarity according to Hamilton's principle
will naturally lead to steady-state solutions that indicate how a cavity's resonant frequency,
$Q$ and optimal coupling coefficient will detune as a result of the beam loading. A driven cavity
Lagrangian is derived from first principles, including the effects of cavity wall losses, input
power and beam interaction. The general formulation is applied to a typical klystron input cavity
to predict the appropriate detuning parameters required to maximize the gain (or modulation depth)
in the average Lorentz factor boost, $\langle \Delta\gamma \rangle$. Numerical examples are presented,
showing agreement with the general detuning trends previously observed in the literature. The
developed formulation carries several advantages for beam-loaded cavity structures. It provides
a self-consistent model for the dynamical (nonlinear) beam--field interaction, a procedure for
maximizing gain under beam-loading conditions, and a useful set of parameters to guide cavity-shape
optimization during the design of beam-loaded systems. Enhanced clarity of the physical picture
underlying the problem seems to be gained using this approach, allowing straightforward inclusion
or exclusion of different field configurations in the calculation and expressing the final results
in terms of measurable quantities. Two field configurations are discussed for the klystron input
cavity, using finite magnetic confinement or no confinement at all. Formulating the problem in
a language that is directly accessible to the powerful techniques found in Hamiltonian dynamics
and canonical transformations may potentially carry an additional advantage in terms of analytical
computational gains, under suitable conditions.

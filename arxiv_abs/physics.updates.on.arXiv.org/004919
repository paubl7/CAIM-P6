Safeguarding the disposal of spent nuclear fuel in a geological repository needs an effective,
efficient, reliable and robust non-destructive assay (NDA) system to ensure the integrity of the
fuel prior to disposal. In the context of the Finnish geological repository, Passive Gamma Emission
Tomography (PGET) will be a part of such an NDA system. We report here on the results of PGET measurements
at the Finnish nuclear power plants during the years 2017-2020. Gamma activity profiles are recorded
from all angles by rotating the detector arrays around the fuel assembly that has been inserted into
the center of the torus. Image reconstruction from the resulting tomographic data is defined as
a constrained minimization problem with a data fidelity term and regularization terms. The activity
and attenuation maps, as well as detector sensitivity corrections, are the variables in the minimization
process. The regularization terms ensure that prior information on the (possible) locations of
fuel rods and their diameter are taken into account. Fuel rod classification, the main purpose of
the PGET method, is based on the difference of the activity of a fuel rod from its immediate neighbors,
taking into account its distance from the assembly center. The classification is carried out by
a support vector machine. We report on the results for ten different fuel types with burnups between
5.72 and 55.0 GWd/tU, cooling times between 1.87 and 34.6 years and initial enrichments between
1.9 and 4.4%. For all fuel assemblies measured, missing fuel rods, partial fuel rods and water channels
were correctly classified. Burnable absorber fuel rods were classified as fuel rods. On rare occasions,
a fuel rod that is present was falsely classified as missing. We conclude that the combination of
the PGET device and our image reconstruction method provides a reliable base for fuel rod classification.

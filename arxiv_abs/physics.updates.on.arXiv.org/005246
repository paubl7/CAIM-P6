Chemical Species Tomography (CST) has been widely applied for imaging of critical gas-phase parameters
in industrial processes. To acquire high-fidelity images, CST is typically implemented by line-of-sight
Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy (WMS) measurements from multiple laser beams. The modulated
transmission signal on each laser beam needs to be a) digitised by a high-speed analogue-to-digital
converter (ADC); b) demodulated by a digital lock-in (DLI) module; and c) transferred to high-level
processor for image reconstruction. Although a fully parallel data acquisition (DAQ) and signal
processing system can achieve these functionalities with maximised temporal response, it leads
to a highly complex, expensive and power-consuming instrumentation system with high potential
for inconsistency between the sampled beams due to the electronics alone. In addition, the huge
amount of spectral data sampled in parallel significantly burdens the communication process in
industrial applications where in situ signal digitisation is distanced from the high-level data
processing. To address these issues, a quasi-parallel sensing technique and electronic circuits
were developed for industrial CST, in which the digitisation and demodulation of the multi-beam
transmission signals are multiplexed over the high-frequency modulation within a wavelength
scan. Our development not only maintains the temporal response of the fully parallel sensing scheme,
but also facilitates the cost-effective implementation of industrial CST with very low complexity
and reduced load on data transfer. The proposed technique is analytically proven, numerically
examined by noise-contaminated CST simulations, and experimentally validated using a lab-scale
CST system with 32 laser beams.

The explicit semi-Lagrangian method method for solution of Lagrangian transport equations as
developed in [Natarajan and Jacobs, Computer and Fluids, 2020] is adopted for the solution of stochastic
differential equations that is consistent with Discontinuous Spectral Element Method (DSEM)
approximations of Eulerian conservation laws. The method extends the favorable properties of
DSEM that include its high-order accuracy, its local and boundary fitted properties and its high
performance on parallel platforms for the concurrent Monte-Carlo, semi-Lagrangian and Eulerian
solution of a class of time-dependent problems that can be described by coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian
formulations. The semi-Lagrangian method seeds particles at Gauss quadrature collocation nodes
within a spectral element. The particles are integrated explicitly in time according to a drift
velocity and a Wiener increment forcing and form the nodal basis for an advected interpolant. This
interpolant is mapped back in a semi-Lagrangian fashion to the Gauss quadrature points through
a least squares fit using constraints for element boundary values. Stochastic Monte-Carlo samples
are averaged element-wise on the quadrature nodes. The stable explicit time step Wiener increment
is sufficiently small to prevent particles from leaving the element's bounds. The semi-Lagrangian
method is hence local and parallel and does not have the grid complexity, and parallelization challenges
of the commonly used Lagrangian particle solvers in particle-mesh methods for solution of Eulerian-Lagrangian
formulations. Formal proof is presented that the semi-Lagrangian algorithm evolves the solution
according to the Eulerian Fokker-Planck equation. Numerical tests in one and two dimensions for
drift-diffusion problems show that the method converges exponentially for constant and non-constant
advection and diffusion velocities.

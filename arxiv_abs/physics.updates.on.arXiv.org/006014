The sub-seasonal and synoptic-scale variability of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall are controlled
primarily by monsoon intra-seasonal oscillations (MISO) and low pressure systems (LPS), respectively.
The positive and negative phases of MISO lead to alternate epochs of above-normal (active) and below-normal
(break) spells of rainfall. LPSs are embedded within the different phases of MISO and are known to
produce heavy precipitation events over central India. Whether the interaction with the MISO phases
modulates the precipitation response of LPSs, and thereby the characteristics of extreme rainfall
events (EREs) remains unaddressed in the available literature. In this study, we analyze the LPSs
that produce EREs of various spatial extents viz., Small, Medium, and Large over central India from
1979 to 2012. We also compare them with the LPSs that pass through central India and do not give any
ERE (LPS-noex). We find that thermodynamic characteristics of LPSs that trigger different spatial
extents of EREs are similar. However, they show differences in their dynamic characteristics.
The ERE producing LPSs are slower, moister and more intense than LPS-noex. The LPSs that lead to Medium
and Large EREs tend to occur during the positive phase of MISO when an active monsoon trough is present
over central India. On the other hand, LPS-noex and the LPSs that trigger Small EREs occur mainly
during the neutral or negative phases of the MISO. The large-scale dynamic forcing, intensification
of LPSs, and diabatic generation of low-level potential vorticity due to the presence of active
monsoon trough help in the organization of convection and lead to Medium and Large EREs. On the other
hand, the LPSs that form during the negative or neutral phases of MISO do not intensify much during
their lifetime and trigger scattered convection, leading to EREs of small size.

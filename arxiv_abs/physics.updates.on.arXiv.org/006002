We revise the steady vortex surface theory following the recent finding of asymmetric vortex sheets
(AM,2021). These surfaces avoid the \KH{} instability by adjusting their discontinuity and shape.
The vorticity is confined to the sheet only in an exceptional case considered long ago by Burgers
and Townsend, where it decays as a Gaussian on both sides of the sheet. In generic asymmetric vortex
sheets (Shariff,2021), vorticity leaks to one side or another, making such sheets inadequate for
vortex sheet statistics and anomalous dissipation. Thus, the vorticity in a turbulent flow collapses
along the surface, where the strain tensor's determinant vanishes. The generic Euler vortex sheet
solution matches the planar Burgers-Townsend solution of the Navier-Stokes equation in the local
boundary layer. The most important qualitative observation is that the inequality needed for this
solution's stability breaks the Euler dynamics' time reversibility. We interpret this as dynamic
irreversibility, as it does not involve viscosity and is formulated in terms of the potential Euler
flow. We investigate the equations for these Confined Vortex Surfaces and exactly reduce them to
a minimization of a vortex sheet Hamiltonian on a certain subset of two-dimensional variables.
The axially symmetric surface corresponds to the one-dimensional variational problem. We have
found the analytical solution for the velocity gap for an axially symmetric cylinder. The irreversible
turbulent statistics emerge due to the Gaussian distribution of the symmetric traceless matrix,
describing the strain's boundary value at infinity, with a confined vorticity inequality imposed.
In particular, for the axially symmetric cylinder, we derived an exact distribution of the dissipation
rate given by a stretched exponential.

This work presents a formalism to improve the predictive accuracy of physical models by learning
generalizable augmentations from sparse data. Building on recent advances in data-driven turbulence
modeling, the present approach, referred to as Learning and Inference assisted by Feature-space
Engineering (LIFE), is based on the hypothesis that robustness and generalizability demand a meticulously-designed
feature space that is informed by the underlying physics, and a carefully constructed features-to-augmentation
map. The critical components of this approach are: (1) Maintaining consistency across the learning
and prediction environments; (2) Tightly-coupled inference and learning by constraining the
augmentation to be learnable throughout the inference process; (3) Identification of relevant
physics-informed features in appropriate functional forms to enable significant overlap in feature
space for a wide variety of cases to promote generalizability; (4) Maintaining explicit control
over feature space to change the augmentation function behavior only in the vicinity of available
datapoints. To demonstrate the viability of this approach, it is used in the modeling of bypass transition.
The augmentation is developed on skin friction data from two flat plate cases from the ERCOFTAC dataset.
Piecewise linear interpolation on a structured grid in feature-space is used as a sample functional
form for the augmentation to demonstrate the capability of localized learning. The augmented model
is then applied to a variety of flat plate cases which are characterized by different freestream
turbulence intensities, pressure gradients, and Reynolds numbers. The predictive capability
of the augmented model is also tested on single-stage high-pressure-turbine cascade cases, and
the model performance is analyzed from the perspective of information contained in the feature
space.

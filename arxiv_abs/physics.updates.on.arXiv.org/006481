Fractured metal fragments with rough and irregular surfaces are often found at crime scenes. Current
forensic practice visually inspects the complex jagged trajectory of fractured surfaces to recognize
a ``match'' using comparative microscopy and physical pattern analysis. We developed a novel computational
framework, utilizing the basic concepts of fracture mechanics and statistical analysis to provide
quantitative match analysis for match probability and error rates. The framework employs the statistics
of fracture surfaces to become non-self-affine with unique roughness characteristics at relevant
microscopic length scale, dictated by the intrinsic material resistance to fracture and its microstructure.
At such a scale, which was found to be greater than two grain-size or micro-feature-size, we establish
that the material intrinsic properties, microstructure, and exposure history to external forces
on an evidence fragment have the premise of uniqueness, which quantitatively describes the microscopic
features on the fracture surface for forensic comparisons. The methodology utilizes 3D spectral
analysis of overlapping topological images of the fracture surface and classifies specimens with
very high accuracy using statistical learning. Cross correlations of image-pairs in two frequency
ranges are used to develop matrix variate statistical models for the distributions among matching
and non-matching pairs of images, and provides a decision rule for identifying matches and determining
error rates. A set of thirty eight different fracture surfaces of steel articles were correctly
classified. The framework lays the foundations for forensic applications with quantitative statistical
comparison across a broad range of fractured materials with diverse textures and mechanical properties.

We present a comprehensive inter-comparison of linear regression (LR), stochastic, and deep-learning
approaches for reduced-order statistical emulation of ocean circulation. The reference dataset
is provided by an idealized, eddy-resolving, double-gyre ocean circulation model. Our goal is
to conduct a systematic and comprehensive assessment and comparison of skill, cost, and complexity
of statistical models from the three methodological classes. The model based on LR is considered
as a baseline. Additionally, we investigate its additive white noise augmentation and a multi-level
stochastic approach, deep-learning methods, hybrid frameworks (LR plus deep-learning), and
simple stochastic extensions of deep-learning and hybrid methods. The assessment metrics considered
are: root mean squared error, anomaly cross-correlation, climatology, variance, frequency map,
forecast horizon, and computational cost. We found that the multi-level linear stochastic approach
performs the best for both short- and long-timescale forecasts. The deep-learning hybrid models
augmented by additive state-dependent white noise came second, while their deterministic counterparts
failed to reproduce the characteristic frequencies in climate-range forecasts. Pure deep learning
implementations performed worse than LR and its noise augmentations. Skills of LR and its white
noise extension were similar on short timescales, but the latter performed better on long timescales,
while LR-only outputs decay to zero for long simulations. Overall, our analysis promotes multi-level
LR stochastic models with memory effects, and hybrid models with linear dynamical core augmented
by additive stochastic terms learned via deep learning, as a more practical, accurate, and cost-effective
option for ocean emulation than pure deep-learning solutions.

Accurate prediction of laminar-turbulent transition is a critical element of computational fluid
dynamics simulations for aerodynamic design across multiple flow regimes. Traditional methods
of transition prediction cannot be easily extended to flow configurations where the transition
process depends on a large set of parameters. In comparison, neural network methods allow higher
dimensional input features to be considered without compromising the efficiency and accuracy
of the traditional data driven models. Neural network methods proposed earlier follow a cumbersome
methodology of predicting instability growth rates over a broad range of frequencies, which are
then processed to obtain the N-factor envelope, and then, the transition location based on the correlating
N-factor. This paper presents an end-to-end transition model based on a recurrent neural network,
which sequentially processes the mean boundary-layer profiles along the surface of the aerodynamic
body to directly predict the N-factor envelope and the transition locations over a two-dimensional
airfoil. The proposed transition model has been developed and assessed using a large database of
53 airfoils over a wide range of chord Reynolds numbers and angles of attack. The sequence-to-sequence
transduction model proposed herein provides a more direct approach for accurate predictions of
the transition location than the earlier neural network methods, which predict the local amplification
rate of a single instability mode at a fixed location along the airfoil. The large universe of airfoils
encountered in various applications causes additional difficulties. As such, we provide further
insights on selecting training datasets from large amounts of available data.

Non-invasive detection of microvascular alterations in deep tissues in vivo provides critical
information for clinical diagnosis and evaluation of a broad-spectrum of pathologies. Recently,
the emergence of super-resolution ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) offers new possibilities
for clinical imaging of microvasculature at capillary level. Currently, the clinical utility
of ULM on clinical ultrasound scanners is hindered by the technical limitations, such as long data
acquisition time, and compromised tracking performance associated with low imaging frame-rate.
Here we present an in-human ULM on a high frame-rate (HFR) clinical ultrasound scanner to achieve
super-resolution microvessel imaging using a short acquisition time (<10s). Ultrasound MB data
were acquired from different human tissues, (liver, kidney, pancreatic, and breast tumor) using
an HFR clinical scanner. By leveraging the HFR and advanced processing techniques including sub-pixel
motion registration, MB signal separation, and Kalman filter-based tracking, MBs can be robustly
localized and tracked for successful ULM under the circumstances of relatively high MB concentration
and limited data acquisition time in humans. Subtle morphological and hemodynamic information
were demonstrated on data acquired with single breath-hold and free-hand scanning. Compared with
contrast-enhanced power Doppler generated based on the same MB dataset, ULM showed a 5.7-fold resolution
improvement in a vessel, and provided a wide-range flow speed measurement that is Doppler angle-independent.
This study demonstrated the feasibility of ultrafast in-human ULM in various human tissues based
on a clinical scanner that supports HFR imaging, and showed a great potential for the implementation
of super-resolution ultrasound microvessel imaging in a myriad of clinical applications involving
microvascular abnormalities and pathologies.

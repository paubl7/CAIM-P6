The multiple scattering of an ultrashort laser pulse by a turbid dispersive medium (namely a cloud
of bubbles in water) is investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The theory of Gouesbet
and Gr\'ehan [Part. Part. Syst. Charact. 17 213-224 (2000)] is used to derive an energetic model
of the scattering transient. The spreading and extinction of the pulse is decoupled from the transient
of scattering to describe each phenomenon individually. The transient of scattering is modeled
with the Lorenz-Mie Theory, thus also valid for a relative refractive index lower than one, contrary
to the Debye series expansion which does not converge close to the critical angle. To this aim, the
Scattering Impulse Response Function (SIRF) allows to detect the different modes of scattering
transient in time and direction. The present approach is more generic and can simulate clouds of
air bubbles in water. Two Monte-Carlo approaches are proposed. The first is a pure Monte Carlo approach
where the delay due to the scattering is randomly drawn at each event, while the second is based on
the transport of the whole scattering signal. They are both embedded in the Monte Carlo code Scatter3D
[JOSA A 24, 2206-2219 (2007)]. Both models produce equivalent trends and are validated against
published numerical results. They are applied to the multiple scattering of ultra short pulse by
a cloud of bubble in water in the forward direction. The pulse spread due to the propagation in water
is computed for a wide range of traveled distances and pulse durations, and the optimal pulse duration
is given to minimize the pulse spread at a given distance. The main result is that the scattered photons
exit the turbid medium earlier than the ballistic photons and produce a double peak related to the
refraction in the bubble. This demonstrates the possibility to develop new diagnostics to characterize
dynamic bubbly flows.

This work discusses the numerical aspects of representing the diffusional (condensational) growth
in particulate systems such as atmospheric clouds. It focuses on the Eulerian modeling approach,
in which the evolution of the particle size spectrum is carried out using a fixed-bin discretization
associated with inherent numerical diffusion. Focus is on the applications of MPDATA numerical
schemes (variants explored include: infinite-gauge, non-oscillatory, third-order-terms and
recursive antidiffusive correction). Methodology for handling coordinate transformations
associated with both particle size distribution variable choice and numerical grid layout are
expounded. Analysis of the performance of the scheme is performed using: (i) an analytically solvable
box-model test case, and (ii) the single-column "KiD" test case in which the size-spectral advection
due to condensation is solved simultaneously with the spatial advection in the vertical physical
coordinate, and in which the supersaturation evolution is coupled with the droplet growth through
water mass budget. The single-column problem involves numerical solution of a two-dimensional
advection problem (spectral and spatial dimensions). The box-model simulations demonstrate
that, for the problem considered, even a tenfold decrease of the spurious numerical spectral broadening
can be obtained by a proper choice of the MPDATA variant (maintaining the same spatial and temporal
resolution), yet at an increased computational cost. Analyses using the single-column test case
reveal that the width of the droplet size spectrum is affected by numerical diffusion pertinent
to both spatial and spectral advection. Application of even a single corrective iteration of MPDATA
robustly decreases the relative dispersion of the droplet spectrum, roughly by a factor of two at
the levels of maximal liquid water content.

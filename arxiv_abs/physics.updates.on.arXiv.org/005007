Over the past few decades, the prospect of energy generation from an oscillating piezoelectric
patch has gained attention. A typical setup of this kind would be a piezoelectric patch mounted on
a flexible plate that is exhibiting self-sustained flapping motion. Piezoelectric patches are
generally multilayered consisting of piezoelectric, substrate and electrode layers placed on
top of each other. In this paper, we first propose a quasi-monolithic formulation with exact interface
tracking to simulate the fluid-multilayered structure interactions. We validate the proposed
formulation, using an in-house solver, by considering a simple two-layered plate-like structure
with identical material properties against a single-layered plate. We then use this formulation
to study a two-layered flexible plate, wherein each layer of the plate has independent material
properties. Systematic parametric simulations are conducted to understand the effect of difference
in material properties between the two layers of a plate on the self-sustained flapping dynamics.
The parametric simulations are performed at a Reynolds number Re=1000 by selecting different values
of Young's modulus and density for each of the layers such that the average structure to fluid mass
ratio (m)avg=0.1 and average non-dimensional bending stiffness (KB)avg=0.0005. Firstly, the
effects of difference in elasticity between the two layers on the flapping amplitude, frequency,
forces and vortex shedding patterns are investigated. Following this, the effect of such difference
in elastic properties on the onset of flapping is investigated for a case with Re=1000, (m)avg=0.1
and (KB)avg=0.0008 and two distinct response regimes are observed: (a) fixed-point stable and
(b) periodic LCO. Finally, we look into the effects due to the difference in the structural density
between the two layers on the flapping dynamics of the plate.

Large eddy simulations with three-dimensional finite-volume Conditional Moment Closure (CMC)
model are performed for a hydrogen / nitrogen lifted flame with detailed chemical meachanism. The
emphasis is laid on the influences of mesh resolution and convection scheme of finite-volume CMC
model on predictions of reactive scalar distribution and unsteady flame dynamics. The results
show that the lift-off height is underestimated and the reactive scalars (e.g. temperature, H2
and OH) are over-predicted with coarser CMC mesh. It is also found that further refinement of the
CMC mesh would not considerably improve the results. The time sequences of the most reactive and
stoichiometric OH mass fractions indicate that finer CMC mesh can capture more unsteady details
than coarser CMC mesh. Moreover, the coarse CMC mesh has lower conditional scalar dissipation rate,
which would promote the ealier auto-ignition of the flame base. Besides, the effects of the convection
schemes in the CMC equations on the lifted flame characteristics are also investigated. It is shown
that different convection schemes lead to limited differences on the time-averaged temperature,
mixture fraction and species mass fractions. Moreover, the RMS values of H2 and OH mass fractions
show larger deviation from the measurements with hybrid upwind and central differencing scheme,
especially around the flame base. Furthermore, the distributions of the numerical flux on the CMC
faces also show obvious distinction between the upwind scheme and the blending scheme. The budget
analysis of the individual CMC terms shows that a sequence of CMC faces has comparable contributions
with upwind scheme. However, with the hybrid schemes, the instantaneous flux is dominantly from
limited CMC faces. The reactivity of a CMC cell is more easily to be affected by its neighbors when
the upwind scheme is used.

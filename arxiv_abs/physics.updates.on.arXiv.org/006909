The loss of melanized neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta is a primary feature in Parkinson's
disease (PD). Iron deposition occurs in conjunction with this loss. Loss of nigral neurons should
remove barriers for diffusion and increase diffusivity of water molecules in regions undergoing
this loss. In metrics from single-compartment diffusion tensor imaging models, these changes
should manifest as increases in mean diffusivity and the free water compartment as well as and reductions
in fractional anisotropy. However, studies examining nigral diffusivity changes from PD with
single-compartment models have yielded inconclusive results and emerging evidence in control
subjects indicates that iron corrupts diffusivity metrics derived from single-compartment models.
Iron-sensitive data and diffusion data were analyzed in two cohorts. The effect of iron on diffusion
measures from single- and bi-compartment models was assessed in both cohorts. Measures sensitive
to the free water compartment and iron content were found to increase in substantia nigra of the PD
group in both cohorts. However, diffusion markers derived from the single-compartment model were
not replicated across cohorts. Correlations were seen between single-compartment diffusion
measures and iron markers in the discovery cohort and validation cohort but no correlation was observed
between a measure from the bi-compartment model related to the free water compartment and iron markers
in either cohort. The variability of single-compartment nigral diffusion metrics in PD may be attributed
to competing influences of increased iron content, which drives diffusivity down, and increases
in the free water compartment, which drives diffusivity up. In contrast to diffusion metrics derived
from the single-compartment model, no relationship was seen between iron and the free water compartment
in substantia nigra.

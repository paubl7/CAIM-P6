PURPOSE: Permanent breast seed implant (PBSI) using 103Pd is emerging as an effective adjuvant
radiation technique for early-stage breast cancer. However, clinical dose evaluations follow
the water-based TG-43 approach with its considerable approximations. Towards clinical adoption
of advanced TG-186 model-based dose evaluations, this study presents a comprehensive investigation
for PBSI considering both target and normal tissue doses. METHODS: Dose calculations are performed
with the free open-source Monte Carlo (MC) code, egs_brachy, using 2 types of virtual patient models:
TG43sim (simulated TG-43 conditions: all water with no interseed attenuation) and MCref (heterogeneous
tissue modelling from patient CT, interseed attenuation, seeds at implant angle) for 35 patients.
Sensitivity of dose metrics to seed orientation and the threshold for glandular/adipose tissue
segmentation are assessed. RESULTS: In the target volume, D90 is 14.1% lower with MCref than with
TG43sim, on average. Conversely, normal tissue doses are generally higher with MCref than with
TG43sim, e.g., by 22% for skin D1cm2, 82% for ribs Dmax, and 71% for heart D1cm3. Discrepancies between
MCref and TG43sim doses vary over the patient cohort, as well as with the tissue and metric considered.
Doses are sensitive to the glandular/adipose tissue segmentation threshold with differences
of a few percent in target D90. Skin doses are sensitive to seed orientation. CONCLUSIONS: TG-43
dose evaluations generally underestimate doses to critical normal organs/tissues while overestimating
target doses. There is considerable variation in MCref and TG43sim on a patient-by-patient basis,
suggesting that clinical adoption of patient-specific MC dose calculations is motivated. The
MCref framework presented herein provides a consistent modelling approach for clinical implementation
of advanced TG-186 dose calculations.

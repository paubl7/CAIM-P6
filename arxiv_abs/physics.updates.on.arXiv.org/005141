Terahertz spectroscopy allows for identifying different isomers of materials, for drug discrimination
as well as for detecting hazardous substances. As many dielectric materials used for packaging
are transparent in the terahertz spectral range, substances might even be identified if packaged.
Despite these useful applications, terahertz spectroscopy suffers from the still technically
demanding detection of terahertz radiation. Thus, either coherent time-domain-spectroscopy
schemes employing ultrafast pulsed lasers or continuous-wave detection with photomixers requiring
two laser systems are used to circumvent the challenge to detect such low-energetic radiation without
using cooled detectors. Here, we report on the first demonstration of terahertz spectroscopy,
in which the sample interacts with terahertz idler photons, while only correlated visible signal
photons are detected - a concept inspired by quantum optics. To generate these correlated signal-idler
photon pairs, a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal and a 660 nm continuous-wave pump source
are used. After propagating through a single-crystal nonlinear interferometer, the pump photons
are separated from the signal radiation by highly efficient and narrowband volume Bragg gratings.
An uncooled scientific CMOS camera detects the frequency-angular spectra of the remaining visible
signal and reveals terahertz-spectral information in the Stokes as well as the anti-Stokes part
of collinear forward generation. Neither cooled detectors nor expensive pulsed lasers for coherent
detection are required. We demonstrate spectroscopy on the well-known absorption features in
the terahertz spectral range of $\alpha$-lactose monohydrate and para-aminobenzoic acid by detecting
only visible photons.

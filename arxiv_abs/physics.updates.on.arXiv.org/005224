Since the beginning of the corona pandemic in March 2020, various parameters for describing the
spread of the disease have been specified for Germany in addition to the daily infection figures
(new infections and total infections), which are also used for political decisions. In addition
to excess mortality and the weekly incidence, these include the doubling time $T_2$ and the reproduction
number $R_t$. For the latter, various estimates can be found on the website of the Robert-Koch-Institute,
see \cite{EstR:RKI}, which are calculated from the case numbers for all of Germany; local differences
are not taken into account here. In the present article, the calculations of the RKI on a local level
are examined using the example of northern Rhineland-Palatinate and its districts. Here, not the
reporting date but the onset of illness is used as a reference for the calculation of $R_t$. For cases
where the onset of illness is not known, an adjusted generalized extreme value distribution (GEV)
is first fitted to the data for which the reporting delay (difference between the onset of illness
and the reporting date) is available and examined for further characteristics such as local as well
as demographic differences. This GEV distribution is then used to calculate the reporting delays
of incomplete data points. The calculation of the daily value of $R_t$ between the end of February
and the end of October showed a similar course of the reproductive rate compared to the nationwide
figures. Expectably larger statistical fluctuations were observed in the summer, mainly due to
lower case numbers. The values for northern Rhineland-Palatinate have been consistently above
$1$ since about mid-September. The calculations can also be transferred to other regions and administrative
districts.

We report on direct numerical simulations of the effect of electrostatic charges on particle-laden
duct flows. The corresponding electrostatic forces are known to affect particle dynamics at small
scales and the associated turbophoretic drift. Our simulations, however, predicted that electrostatic
forces also dominate the vortical motion of the particles, induced by the secondary flows of Prandtl's
second kind of the carrier fluid. Herein we treated flows at two frictional Reynolds numbers ($Re_\mathrm{\tau}=$
300 and~600), two particle-to-gas density ratios ($\rho_\mathrm{p}/\rho=$ 1000 and 7500), and
three Coulombic-to-gravitational force ratios ($F_\mathrm{el}/F_\mathrm{g}=$ 0, 0.004, and
0.026). In flows with a high density ratio at $Re_\mathrm{\tau}=$ 600 and $F_\mathrm{el}/F_\mathrm{g}=$
0.004, the particles tend to accumulate at the walls. On the other hand, at a lower density ratio,
respectively a higher $F_\mathrm{el}/F_\mathrm{g}$ of 0.026, the charged particles still follow
the secondary flow structures that are developed in the duct. However, even in this case, the electrostatic
forces counteract the particles' inward flux from the wall and, as a result, their vortical motion
in these secondary structures is significantly attenuated. This change in the flow pattern results
in an increase of the particle number density at the bisectors of the walls by a factor of five compared
to the corresponding flow with uncharged particles. Finally, at $Re_\mathrm{\tau}=$ 300, $\rho_\mathrm{p}/\rho=$
1000, and $F_\mathrm{el}/F_\mathrm{g}=$ 0.026 the electrostatic forces dominate over the aerodynamic
forces and gravity and, consequently the particles no longer follow the streamlines of the carrier
gas.

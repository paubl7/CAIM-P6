Solar Orbiter was launched on February 10, 2020 with the purpose of investigating solar and heliospheric
physics using a payload of instruments designed for both remote and in-situ sensing. Similar to
the recently launched Parker Solar Probe, and unlike earlier missions, Solar Orbiter carries instruments
designed to measure the low frequency DC electric fields. In this paper we assess the quality of the
low-frequency DC electric field measured by the Radio and Plasma Waves instrument (RPW) on Solar
Orbiter. In particular we investigate the possibility of using Solar Orbiter's DC electric and
magnetic field data to estimate the solar wind speed. We use deHoffmann-Teller (HT) analysis based
on measurements of the electric and magnetic fields to find the velocity of solar wind current sheets
which minimizes a single component of the electric field. By comparing the HT velocity to proton
velocity measured by the Proton and Alpha particle Sensor (PAS) we develop a simple model for the
effective antenna length, $L_\text{eff}$ of the E-field probes. We then use the HT method to estimate
the speed of the solar wind. Using the HT method, we find that the observed variations in $E_y$ are
often in excellent agreement with the variations in the magnetic field. The magnitude of $E_y$,
however, is uncertain due to the fact that the $L_\text{eff}$ depends on the plasma environment.
We derive an empirical model relating $L_\text{eff}$ to the Debye length, which we can use to improve
the estimate of $E_y$ and consequently the estimated solar wind speed. The low frequency electric
field provided by RPW is of high quality. Using deHoffmann-Teller analysis, Solar Orbiter's magnetic
and electric field measurements can be used to estimate the solar wind speed when plasma data is unavailable.

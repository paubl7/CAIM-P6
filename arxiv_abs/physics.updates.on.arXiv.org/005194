We derive a low-scaling $G_0W_0$ algorithm for molecules, using pair atomic density fitting (PADF)
and an imaginary time representation of the Green's function and describe its implementation in
the Slater type orbital (STO) based Amsterdam density functional (ADF) electronic structure code.
We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm on a series of water clusters with up to 432 atoms
and 7776 basis functions and observe asymptotic quadratic scaling with realistic threshold qualities
controlling distance effects and basis sets of triple-$\zeta$ (TZ) plus double polarization quality.
Also owing to a very small prefactor, with these settings a $G_0W_0$ calculation for the largest
of these clusters takes only 240 CPU hours. With errors of 0.24 eV for HOMO energies in the GW100 database
on the quadruple-$\zeta$ level, our implementation is less accurate than canonical all-electron
implementations using the larger def2-QZVP GTO-tpye basis set. Apart from basis set errors, this
is related to the well-known shortcomings of the GW space-time method using analytical continuation
techniques as well as to numerical issues of the PADF-approach of accurately representing diffuse
AO-products. We speculate, that these difficulties might be overcome by using optimized auxiliary
fit sets with more diffuse functions of higher angular momenta. Despite these shortcomings, for
subsets of medium and large molecules from the GW5000 database, the error of our approach using basis
sets of TZ and augmented DZ quality is decreasing with system size. On the augmented DZ level we reproduce
canonical, complete basis set limit extrapolated reference values with an accuracy of 80 meV on
average for a set of 20 large organic molecules. We anticipate our algorithm, in its current form,
to be very useful in the study of single-particle properties of large organic systems such as chromophores
and acceptor molecules.

This work extends the input-output approach to the study of wall-bounded shear flows manipulated
using actuators common in experimental flow control studies. In particular, we adapt this powerful
analytical framework to investigate the flow response to specified geometric actuation patterns/intensities
(e.g., different plasma actuators) that can be applied over a range of different temporal input
signals. For example, the commonly studied steady-state (time-averaged) flow response corresponds
to a superposition of step responses in our modeling framework. The approach takes advantage of
the linearity of the transfer function representation to construct the actuated flow field as a
weighted superposition of the flow responses to point sources of varying intensity comprising
the actuation model. We first validate the proposed method through comparisons with numerical
and experimental studies of the time-averaged behavior of a transitional boundary layer actuated
using a dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuator operating in constricted discharge
mode. The method is shown to reproduce the streamwise velocity field and the vortical structures
observed downstream of the tested plasma actuator configurations. We then demonstrate that the
method provides even better agreement in the steady-state response of the boundary layer subject
to actuation from arrays of symmetric plasma actuators arranged in both spanwise and serpentine
geometries. These results indicate the utility of this extension to the widely used input-output
framework in analyzing the effects of certain actuation modalities that have shown promise in flow
manipulation strategies for drag reduction. An important benefit of this analytical method is
the low computational cost associated with its use in extensive parametric studies that would be
cost-prohibitive using experiments or high-fidelity simulations.

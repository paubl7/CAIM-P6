Space agencies and private companies prepare the beginning of the human space exploration for the
2030s with missions to put the first human on the Mars surface. The absence of gravity and radiation,
along with distance, isolation and hostile environment are expected to increase medical events
with unidentified manifestations along the crewmembers. The current healthcare strategy based
on telemedicine and the possibility to stabilise and transport the injured crewmember to a terrestrial
definitive medical facility is not applicable in exploration class missions. Therefore, full
autonomous capability to solve medical situations will guide design of future healthcare systems
on-board. This study presents ten basic principles and the concept design of MEDEA, an on-board
clinical decision support system to help crewmembers to deal with medical conditions, with special
attention to emergency care situations and critical monitoring. Therefore, MEDEA is conceptually
designed as a software suite of four interconnected modules. The main of them is responsible to give
direct advice to the crew by means of a deep learning multitask neural network to predict the characters
of the medical event, a classifier of the tertiary medical intervention and an optimiser of medical
action plans. This module is continuously evaluate and re-trained with changing physiological
data from the crew by an adaptive deep learning module, ensuring fairness, interpretability and
traceability of decision making during the full operational time of MEDEA. Finally, MEDEA would
be semantically interoperable with health information systems on-board by a FHIR module. The deployment
of MEDEA on-board of future missions to Mars will facilitate the deployment of a comprehensive preventive
medical strategy, future quantitative medicine on Earth and on the expansion of humans throughout
the solar system.

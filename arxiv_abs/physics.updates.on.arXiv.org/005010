We analyze the effects of the passing energetic particles on the resistive ballooning modes (RBM)
and the energetic particle driven modes in JT-60SA plasma, which leads to the prediction of the stability
in N-NBI heated plasma. The analysis is performed using the code FAR3d that solves the reduced MHD
equations describing the linear evolution of the poloidal flux and the toroidal component of the
vorticity in a full 3D system, coupled with equations of density and parallel velocity moments for
the energetic particle (EP) species assuming an averaged Maxwellian EP distribution fitted to
the slowing down distribution, including the effect of the acoustic modes. The simulations show
the possible destabilization of a 3/2-4/2 TAE with a frequency (f) of 115 kHz, a 6/4-7/4 TAE with f=98
kHz and a 6/4 or 7/4 BAE with f=57 kHz in the ITER-like inductive scenario. If the energetic particle
beta increases, Beta induced AEs (BAE), Toroidal AEs (TAE) and Elliptical AEs (EAE) are destabilized
between the inner-middle plasma region, leading to the overlapping of AE of different toroidal
families. If these instabilities coexist in the non-linear saturation phase the EP transport could
be enhanced leading to a lower heating efficiency. For a hypothetical configuration based on the
ITER-like inductive scenario but an center peaked EP profile, the EP beta threshold increases and
several BAEs are destabilized in the inner plasma region, indicating an improved AE stability with
respect to the off-axis peaked EP profile. In addition, the analysis of a hypothetical JT-60SA scenario
with a resonant q=1 in the inner plasma region shows the destabilization of fishbones-like instabilities
by the off-axis peaked EP profile. Also, the EPs have an stabilizing effect on the RBM, stronger as
the population of EP with low energies (below 250 keV) increases at the plasma pedestal.

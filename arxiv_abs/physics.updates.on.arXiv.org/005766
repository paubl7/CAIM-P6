The characterization of nanostructured surfaces with sensitivity in the sub-nm range is of high
importance for the development of current and next generation integrated electronic circuits.
Modern transistor architectures for e.g. FinFETs are realized by lithographic fabrication of
complex, well ordered nanostructures. Recently, a novel characterization technique based on
X-ray fluorescence measurements in grazing incidence geometry has been proposed for such applications.
This technique uses the X-ray standing wave field, arising from an interference between incident
and the reflected radiation, as a nanoscale sensor for the dimensional and compositional parameters
of the nanostructure. The element sensitivity of the X-ray fluorescence technique allows for a
reconstruction of the spatial element distribution using a finite-element method. Due to a high
computational time, intelligent optimization methods employing machine learning algorithms
are essential for a timely provision of results. Here, a sampling of the probability distributions
by Bayesian optimization is not only fast, it also provides an initial estimate of the parameter
uncertainties and sensitivities. The high sensitivity of the method requires a precise knowledge
of the material parameters in the modeling of the dimensional shape provided that some physical
properties of the material are known or determined beforehand. The unknown optical constants were
extracted from an unstructured but otherwise identical layer system by means of soft X-ray reflectometry.
The spatial distribution profiles of the different elements contained in the grating structure
were compared to scanning electron and atomic force microscopy and the influence of carbon surface
contamination on the modeling results were discussed.

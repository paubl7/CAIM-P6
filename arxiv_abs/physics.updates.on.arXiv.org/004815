We aim to search for the connection between the spacetime with an invariant minimum speed so-called
Symmetrical Special Relativity (SSR) with Lorentz violation and the Gravitational Bose Einstein
Condensate (GBEC) as the central core of a star of gravitational vacuum (gravastar), where one normally
introduces a cosmological constant for representing an anti-gravity. This usual model of gravastar
with an equation of state (EOS) for vacuum energy inside the core will be generalized for many modes
of vacuum (dark energy star) in order to circumvent the embarrassment generated by the horizon singularity
as the final stage of a gravitational collapse. In the place of the problem of a singularity of an event
horizon, we introduce a phase transition between gravity and anti-gravity before reaching the
Schwarzschild (divergent) radius $R_S$ for a given coexistence radius $R_{coexistence}$ slightly
larger than $R_S$ and slightly smaller than the core radius $R_{core}$ of GBEC, where the metric
of the repulsive sector (core of GBEC) would diverge for $r=R_{core}$, so that for such a given radius
of phase coexistence $R_S<R_{coexistence} <R_{core}$, both divergences at $R_S$ of Schwarzschild
metric and at $R_{core}$ of the repulsive core are eliminated, thus preventing the formation of
the event horizon. So the causal structure of SSR helps us to elucidate such puzzle of singularity
of event horizon by also providing a quantum interpretation for GBEC and thus by explaining the origin
of a strong anisotropy due to the minimum speed that leads to the phase transition gravity/anti-gravity
during the collapse of the star. Furthermore, due to the absence of an event horizon of black hole
(BH) where any signal cannot propagate, the new collapsed structure presents a signal propagation
in its region of coexistence of phases where the coexistence metric does not diverge.

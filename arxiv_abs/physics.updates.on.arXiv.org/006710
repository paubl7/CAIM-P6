Low-noise lasers are of central importance in a wide variety of applications, including high spectral-efficiency
coherent communication protocols, distributed fibre sensing, and long distance coherent LiDAR.
In addition to low phase noise, frequency agility, that is, the ability to achieve high-bandwidth
actuation of the laser frequency, is imperative for triangular chirping in frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) based ranging or any optical phase locking as routinely used in metrology.
While integrated silicon-based lasers have experienced major advances and are now employed on
a commercial scale in data centers, integrated lasers with sub-100 Hz-level intrinsic linewidth
are based on optical feedback from photonic circuits that lack frequency agility. Here, we demonstrate
a wafer-scale-manufacturing-compatible hybrid photonic integrated laser that exhibits ultralow
intrinsic linewidth of 25 Hz while offering unsurpassed megahertz actuation bandwidth, with a
tuning range larger than 1 GHz. Our approach uses ultralow-loss (1 dB/m) Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic microresonators,
combined with aluminium nitride (AlN) or lead zirconium titanate (PZT) microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS) based stress-optic actuation. Electrically driven low-phase noise lasing is attained
by self-injection locking of an Indium Phosphide (InP) laser chip and only limited by fundamental
thermo-refractive noise. By utilizing difference drive and apodization of the photonic chip,
a flat actuation response up to 10 MHz is achieved. We leverage this capability to demonstrate a compact
coherent LiDAR engine that can generate up to 800 kHz FMCW triangular optical chirp signals, requiring
neither any active linearization nor predistortion compensation, and perform a 10 m optical ranging
experiment, with a resolution of 12.5 cm.

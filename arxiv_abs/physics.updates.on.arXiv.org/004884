According to general relativity theory (GRT), the geopotential difference (GD) can be determined
by comparing the change in time difference between precise clocks using the precise point positioning
(PPP) time transfer technique, referred to as the relativistic PPP time comparison approach. We
focused on high-precision time comparison between two precise clocks for determining the GD using
the relativistic PPP time transfer,and conducted simulation experiments to validate the approach.
In the experiments, we consider three cases to evaluate the performance of the approach using clocks
with different stabilities, namely, the frequency stabilities of the clocks equipped at three
selected ground stations are respectively (Case 1), (Case 2), and (Case 3) at time period. Conclusions
are drawn from the experimental results. First, high-precision clocks can significantly improve
the accuracy for PPP time transfer, but the improvement is limited by measurement noises. Compared
to Case 1, the long-term stabilities of OPMT-BRUX as well as PTBB-BRUX are improved in Cases 2 and
3. The frequency stabilities of Cases 1-3 are approximately 4.28*10-16, 4.00*10-17, and 3.22*10-17
at 10-day averaging time for OPMT-BRUX, respectively, and for PTBB-BRUX, these values are approximately
3.73*10-16, 8.17*10-17, and 4.64*10-17. Second, the geopotential difference between any two
stations can be determined at the decimeter level, with its accuracy being consistent with the stabilities
of the time links in Cases 1-3. In Case 3, the determined geopotential differences between OPMT and
BRUX deviate from the EIGEN-6C4 model values by -0.64 m2/s2 with an uncertainty of 1.11 m2/s2, whereas
the deviation error between PTBB and BRUX is 0.76 m2/s2 with an uncertainty of 1.79 m2/s2. The approach
proposed in this study can be also applied to testing GRT.

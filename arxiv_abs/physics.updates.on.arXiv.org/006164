Simulating inhomogeneous flows with different characteristic scales in different coordinate
directions using the collide-and-stream based lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) can be accomplished
efficiently using rectangular lattice grids. We develop and investigate a new rectangular central
moment LBM based on non-orthogonal moment basis (referred to as RC-LBM). The equilibria to which
the central moments relax under collision in this approach are obtained from matching with those
corresponding to the continuous Maxwell distribution. A Chapman-Enskog analysis is performed
to derive the correction terms to the second order moment equilibria involving the grid aspect ratio
and velocity gradients that restores the isotropy of the viscous stress tensor and eliminates the
non-Galilean invariant cubic velocity terms of the resulting hydrodynamical equations. A special
case of this rectangular formulation involving the raw moments (referred to as the RNR-LBM) is also
constructed. The resulting schemes represent a considerable simplification, especially for
the transformation matrices and isotropy corrections, and improvement over the existing MRT-LB
schemes on rectangular lattice grids that use orthogonal moment basis. Numerical validation study
of both the RC-LBM and RNR-LBM for a variety of benchmark flow problems are performed that show good
accuracy at various grid aspect ratios. The ability of our proposed schemes to simulate flows using
relatively lower grid aspect ratios than considered in prior rectangular LB approaches is demonstrated.
Furthermore, simulations reveal the superior stability characteristics of the RC-LBM over RNR-LBM
in handling shear flows at lower viscosities and/or higher characteristic velocities. In addition,
computational advantages of using our rectangular LB formulation in lieu of that based on the square
lattice is shown.

The multiphase flow of droplets is widespread, both at the industrial and the microscale, for both
biological and non-biological applications alike. But the ensemble interactions of such systems
are inherently nonlinear and complex, compounded by interfacial effects, making it a difficult
many-body problem for theory. In comparison, the self-assembly dynamics of solid particles in
flow have long been described and successfully exploited in the field of inertial microfluidics,
where particle crystals can be realized from inertial forces and hydrodynamic interactions. Here,
we report novel self-assembly dynamics of liquid drops in confined microfluidic channels that
contrast starkly with the established paradigm of inertial microfluidics: higher inertia leads
to better spatial ordering. Instead, we find that the conventional straight wall channel geometry
not only fails to achieve regular spatial ordering for drops but actually exacerbates it with increasing
inertia. Conversely, an asymmetric serpentine geometry is able to achieve long-range, periodic
spatial ordering over length scales that are at least 3 orders of magnitude greater than the drop
diameter, particularly at low inertia. Experimentally, we are able to decouple droplet generation
from ordering, enabling independent variation of number density, confinement, inertia, and surfactant
concentration. We find the inertia-dependent emergence of preferred drop separations and show
for the first time that Marangoni effects can influence the longitudinal ordering of multidrop
arrays. These results present a largely unexplored direction for inertial microfluidics but also
show the potential of its unification with droplet microfluidics. In particular, the utility of
passively restoring uniform drop spacing on-chip is a key requirement for the streamlined integration
of incubation and drop-by-drop interrogation capabilities.

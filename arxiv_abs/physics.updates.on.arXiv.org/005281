Nonlinear optical spectroscopies are powerful tools for probing quantum dynamics in molecular
and nanoscale systems. While intuition about ultrafast spectroscopies is often built by considering
impulsive optical pulses, actual experiments have finite-duration pulses, which can be important
for interpreting and predicting experimental results. We present a new freely available open source
method for spectroscopic modeling, called Ultrafast Ultrafast (UF$^2$) Spectroscopy, which
enables computationally efficient and convenient prediction of nonlinear spectra, including
treatment of arbitrary finite duration pulse shapes. UF$^2$ is a Fourier-based method that requires
diagonalization of the Liouvillian propagator of the system density matrix. We also present a Runge-Kutta
Euler (RKE) direct propagation method. We include open-systems dynamics in the secular Redfield,
full Redfield, and Lindblad formalisms with Markovian baths. For non-Markovian systems, the degrees
of freedom corresponding to memory effects are brought into the system and treated nonperturbatively.
We analyze the computational complexity of the algorithms and demonstrate numerically that, including
the cost of diagonalizing the propagator, UF$^2$ is 20-200 times faster than the direct propagation
method for secular Redfield models with arbitrary Hilbert space dimension; that it is similarly
faster for full Redfield models at least up to system dimensions where the propagator requires more
than 20 GB to store; and that for Lindblad models it is faster up to dimension near 100, with speedups
for small systems by factors of over 500. UF$^2$ and RKE are part of a larger open source Ultrafast
Software Suite, which includes tools for automatic generation and calculation of Feynman diagrams.

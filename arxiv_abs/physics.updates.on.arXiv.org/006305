The seamless forecast approach of subseasonal to seasonal scale variability has been succeeding
in the forecast of multiple meteorological scales in a uniform framework. In this paradigm, it is
hypothesized that reduction in initial error in dynamical forecast would help to reduce forecast
error in extended lead-time up to 2-3 weeks. This is tested in a version of operational extended range
forecasts based on Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) developed at Indian Institute of Tropical
Meteorology (IITM), Pune. Forecast skills are assessed to understand the role of initial errors
on the prediction skill for MJO. A set of lowest and highest initial day error (LIDE & HIDE) cases are
defined and the error-growth for these categories are analysed for the strong MJO events during
May to September (MJJAS). The MJO forecast initial errors are categorized and defined using the
well-known multivariate MJO index introduced by Wheeler &Hendon (2004). The probability distribution
of bivariate RMSE and error growth evolution (first order difference of index error for each successive
lead days) with respect to extended range lead-time are used as metrics in this analysis. The result
showed that initial error is not showing any influence in the skill of model after a lead time of 7-10
days and the error growth remains the same for both set of errors. A rapid error growth evolution of
same order is seen for both the classified cases. Further the physical attribution of these errors
is studied and found that the errors originate from the events with initial phase in Western Pacific
and Indian Ocean. The spatial distribution of OLR and the zonal winds also confirms the same. The
study emphasises the importance of better representation of MJO phases especially over Indian
ocean in the model to improve the MJO prediction rather than focusing primarily on the initial condition

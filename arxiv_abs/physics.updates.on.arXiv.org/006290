Under certain conditions, the dynamics of a nonlinear mechanical system can be represented by a
single nonlinear modal oscillator. The properties of the modal oscillator can be determined by
computational or experimental nonlinear modal analysis. The simplification to a single-nonlinear-mode
model facilitates qualitative and global analysis, and substantially reduces the computational
effort required for probabilistic methods and design optimization. Important limitations of
this theory are that only purely mechanical systems can be analyzed and that the respective nonlinear
mode has to be recomputed when the system's structural properties are varied. With the theoretical
extension proposed in this work, it becomes feasible to attach linear subsystems to the primary
mechanical system, and to approximate the dynamics of this coupled system using only the nonlinear
mode of the primary mechanical system. The attachments must be described by linear ordinary or differential-algebraic
equations with time-invariant coefficient matrices. The attachments do not need to be of purely
mechanical nature, but may contain, for instance, electric, magnetic, acoustic, thermal or aerodynamic
models. This considerably extends the range of utility of nonlinear modes to applications as diverse
as model updating or vibration energy harvesting. As long as the attachments do not significantly
deteriorate the host system's modal deflection shape, it is shown that their effect can be reduced
to a complex-valued modal impedance and an imposed modal forcing term. In the present work, the proposed
approach is computationally assessed for the analysis of exciter-structure interaction. More
specifically, the force drop typically encountered in frequency response testing is revisited.

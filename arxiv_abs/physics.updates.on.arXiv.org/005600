In cancer, treatment failure and disease recurrence have been associated with small subpopulations
of cancer cells with a stem-like phenotype. In this paper, we develop and investigate a phenotype-structured
model of solid tumour growth in which cells are structured by a stemness level, which varies continuously
between stem-like and terminally differentiated behaviours. Cell evolution is driven by proliferation
and apoptosis, as well as advection and diffusion with respect to the stemness structure variable.
We use the model to investigate how the environment, in particular oxygen levels, affects the tumour's
population dynamics and composition, and its response to radiotherapy. We use a combination of
numerical and analytical techniques to quantify how under physiological oxygen levels the cells
evolve to a differentiated phenotype and under low oxygen level (i.e., hypoxia) they de-differentiate.
Under normoxia, the proportion of cancer stem cells is typically negligible and the tumour may ultimately
become extinct whereas under hypoxia cancer stem cells comprise a dominant proportion of the tumour
volume, enhancing radio-resistance and favouring the tumour's long-term survival. We then investigate
how such phenotypic heterogeneity impacts the tumour's response to treatment with radiotherapy
under normoxia and hypoxia. Of particular interest is establishing how the presence of radio-resistant
cancer stem cells can facilitate a tumour's regrowth following radiotherapy. We also use the model
to show how radiation-induced changes in tumour oxygen levels can give rise to complex re-growth
dynamics. For example, transient periods of hypoxia induced by damage to tumour blood vessels may
rescue the cancer cell population from extinction and drive secondary regrowth. Further model
extensions to account for spatial variation are also discussed briefly.

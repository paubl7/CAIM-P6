Can satellite data be used to address challenges currently faced by the Offshore Renewable Energy
(ORE) sector? What benefit can satellite observations bring to resource assessment and maintenance
of ORE farms? Can satellite observations be used to assess the environmental impact of offshore
renewables leading towards a more sustainable ORE sector? This review paper faces these questions
presenting a holistic view of the current interactions between satellite and ORE sectors, and future
needs to make this partnerships grow. The aim of the work is to start the conversation between these
sectors by establishing a common ground. We present offshore needs and satellite technology limitations,
as well as potential opportunities and areas of growth. To better understand this, the reader is
guided through the history, current developments, challenges and future of offshore wind, tidal
and wave energy technologies. Then, an overview on satellite observations for ocean applications
is given, covering types of instruments and how they are used to provide different metocean variables,
satellite performance, and data processing and integration. Past, present and future satellite
missions are also discussed. Finally, the paper focuses on innovation opportunities and the potential
of synergies between the ORE and satellite sectors. Specifically, we pay attention to improvements
that satellite observations could bring to standard measurement techniques: assessing uncertainty,
wind, tidal and wave conditions forecast, as well as environmental monitoring from space. Satellite-enabled
measurement of ocean physical processes and applications for fisheries, mammals and birds, and
habitat change, are also discussed in depth.

According to scientific realism, science gives us an approximately true description of what the
world is like. But what does it mean? In this chapter, we focus on the ontological and metaphysical
aspects of this discussion. That is, we are concerned with the following questions: what there is,
according to our best scientific theories? And how are these things that theories say exist? We start
from the assumption that a genuine scientific realism must deal with these issues. Taking non-relativistic
quantum mechanics as a case study, we discuss some of the challenges currently faced by a genuinely
realistic stance. We argue, first, that in the ontological aspect, realists are in the same boat
as science, that is, without sufficient epistemic justification to adopt the belief in the entities
postulated by a single quantum theory, given that experience (currently) is not able to decide between
rival theories; in the metaphysical aspect, realists also encounter problems with theory choice,
given the possibility of associating more than one metaphysical theory with the description of
the entities postulated by each quantum theory. The same goes for structuralist alternatives,
since, even if we accept that scientific theories are committed to the existence of structures,
but not objects, we still do not know what structures are, metaphysically. Finally, we move forward
in the discussion with the meta-Popperian method, which serves to reduce the metaphysical alternatives
associated with the ontological postulates of scientific theories. We may not know what the correct
alternative is, but we have been able to progressively check which metaphysical alternatives are
incompatible with each scientific theory.

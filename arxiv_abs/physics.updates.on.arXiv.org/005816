With the development of the circular collider, it is necessary to make accurate physics experimental
measurements of particle properties at higher luminosity $Z$ pole. Micro-pattern gaseous detectors
(MPGDs), which contain Gaseous Electron Multiplier (GEM) and Micro-mesh gaseous structures (Micromegas),
have excellent potential for development as the readout devices of the time projection chamber
(TPC) tracker detector. To meet the updated physics requirements of the high luminosity $Z$ from
the preliminary concept design report (preCDR) to concept design report (CDR) at the circular electron
positron collider (CEPC), In this paper, the space charge distortion of the TPC detector is simulated
with the CEPC beam structure. Using the multi-physics simulation software package, the distribution
of ion estimated by Geant4 is used as the input for the differential equation, and the relationship
between the ion density distribution and electric field in the detector chamber is simulated. These
simulation results show that the maximum deviation for Higgs $\mathcal{O}$(25 $\mu$m) meets the
performance requirements in CEPC TPC detector at the high luminosity $Z$ pole, while it is still
a considerable challenge for $Z$ pole, with the maximum deviation $\mathcal{O}$($>100~\mu$m).
According to the previous developments, the cascaded structure of GEM and Micromegas detector
has been measured. The new considerations of the detector's requirements were given, the gain needs
to be reached to about 2000 with IBF$\times$Gain under 0.1, and IBF means the ions back flow ratio
of the detector. The pixel TPC is a potential option to replace the traditional MPGDs with the low
gain, low occupancy, and outstanding pattern recognition. Finally, some update parameters and
experiments results were compared.

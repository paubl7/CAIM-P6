Aims. We present observations of the first coronal mass ejection (CME) observed at the Solar Orbiter
spacecraft on April 19, 2020, and the associated Forbush decrease (FD) measured by its High Energy
Telescope (HET). This CME is a multispacecraft event also seen near Earth the next day. Methods.
We highlight the capabilities of HET for observing small short-term variations of the galactic
cosmic ray count rate using its single detector counters. The analytical ForbMod model is applied
to the FD measurements to reproduce the Forbush decrease at both locations. Input parameters for
the model are derived from both in situ and remote-sensing observations of the CME. Results. The
very slow (~350 km/s) stealth CME caused a FD with an amplitude of 3 % in the low-energy cosmic ray measurements
at HET and 2 % in a comparable channel of the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER)
on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, as well as a 1 % decrease in neutron monitor measurements. Significant
differences are observed in the expansion behavior of the CME at different locations, which may
be related to influence of the following high speed solar wind stream. Under certain assumptions,
ForbMod is able to reproduce the observed FDs in low-energy cosmic ray measurements from HET as well
as CRaTER, but with the same input parameters, the results do not agree with the FD amplitudes at higher
energies measured by neutron monitors on Earth. We study these discrepancies and provide possible
explanations. Conclusions. This study highlights that the novel measurements of the Solar Orbiter
can be coordinated with other spacecraft to improve our understanding of space weather in the inner
heliosphere. Multi-spacecraft observations combined with data-based modeling are also essential
to understand the propagation and evolution of CMEs as well as their space weather impacts.

We make use of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) data to explore the nature of solar wind turbulence focusing
on the Alfv\'enic character and power spectra of the fluctuations and their dependence on distance
and context (i.e. large scale solar wind properties), aiming to understand the role that different
effects such as source properties, solar wind expansion, stream interaction might play in determining
the turbulent state. We carry out a statistical survey of the data from the first five orbits of PSP
with a focus on how the fluctuation properties at the large, MHD scales, vary with different solar
wind streams and distance from the Sun. A more in-depth analysis from several selected periods is
also presented. Our results show that as fluctuations are transported outward by the solar wind,
the magnetic field spectrum steepens while the shape of the velocity spectrum remains unchanged.
The steepening process is controlled by the "age" of the turbulence, determined by the wind speed
together with the radial distance. Statistically, faster solar wind has higher "Alfv\'enicity",
with more dominant outward propagating wave component and more balanced magnetic/kinetic energies.
The outward wave dominance gradually weakens with radial distance, while the excess of magnetic
energy is found to be stronger as we move closer toward the Sun. We show that the turbulence properties
can vary significantly stream to stream even if these streams are of similar speed, indicating very
different origins of these streams. Especially, the slow wind that originates near the polar coronal
holes has much lower Alfv\'enicity compared with the slow wind that originates from the active regions/pseudostreamers.
We show that structures such as heliospheric current sheets and velocity shears can play an important
role in modifying the properties of the turbulence.

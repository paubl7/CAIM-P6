This morphological study identifies and measures recent nationwide trends in American street
network design. Historically, orthogonal street grids provided the interconnectivity and density
that researchers identify as important factors for reducing vehicular travel and emissions and
increasing road safety and physical activity. During the 20th century, griddedness declined in
planning practice alongside declines in urban form compactness, density, and connectivity as
urbanization sprawled around automobile dependence. But less is known about comprehensive empirical
trends across US neighborhoods, especially in recent years. This study uses public and open data
to examine tract-level street networks across the entire US. It develops theoretical and measurement
frameworks for a quality of street networks defined here as griddedness. It measures how griddedness,
orientation order, straightness, 4-way intersections, and intersection density declined from
1940 through the 1990s while dead-ends and block lengths increased. However, since 2000, these
trends have rebounded, shifting back toward historical design patterns. Yet, despite this rebound,
when controlling for topography and built environment factors all decades post-1939 are associated
with lower griddedness than pre-1940. Higher griddedness is associated with less car ownership
- which itself has a well-established relationship with vehicle kilometers traveled and greenhouse
gas emissions - while controlling for density, home and household size, income, jobs proximity,
street network grain, and local topography. Interconnected grid-like street networks offer practitioners
an important tool for curbing car dependence and emissions. Once established, street patterns
determine urban spatial structure for centuries, so proactive planning is essential.

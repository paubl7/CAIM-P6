We develop a model-independent framework to study the dynamics of decision-making in opinion networks
for an arbitrary number of agents and an arbitrary number of options. Model-independence means
that the analysis is not performed on a specific set of equations, in contrast to classical approaches
to decision making that fix a specific model and analyze it. Rather, the general features of decision
making in dynamical opinion networks can be derived starting from empirically testable hypotheses
about the deciding agents, the available options, and the interactions among them. After translating
these empirical hypotheses into algebraic ones, we use the tools of equivariant bifurcation theory
to uncover model-independent properties of dynamical opinion networks. The model-independent
results are illustrated on a novel analytical model that is constructed by plugging a generic sigmoidal
nonlinearity, modeling boundedness of opinions and opinion perception, into the model-independent
equivariant structure. Our analysis reveals richer and more flexible opinion-formation behavior
as compared to model-dependent approaches. For instance, analysis reveals the possibility of
switching between consensus and various forms of dissensus by modulation of the level of agent cooperativity
and without requiring any particular ad-hoc interaction topology (e.g., structural balance).
From a theoretical viewpoint, we prove new results in equivariant bifurcation theory. We construct
an exhaustive list of axial subgroups for the action of $\ES_n \times \ES_3$ on $\R^{n-1}\otimes\R^{2}$.
We also generalize this list to the action of $\ES_n \times \ES_k$ on $\R^{n-1}\otimes \R^{k-1}$,
i.e., for $n$ agents and $k$ options, although without proving that in this case the list is exhaustive.

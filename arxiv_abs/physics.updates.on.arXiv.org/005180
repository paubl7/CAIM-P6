Tipping elements in the climate system are large-scale subregions of the Earth that might possess
threshold behavior under global warming with large potential impacts on human societies. Here,
we study a subset of five tipping elements and their interactions in a conceptual and easily extendable
framework: the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice Sheets, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
(AMOC), the El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Amazon rainforest. In this nonlinear and
multistable system, we perform a basin stability analysis to detect its stable states and their
associated Earth system resilience. Using this approach, we perform a system-wide and comprehensive
robustness analysis with more than 3.5 billion ensemble members. Further, we investigate dynamic
regimes where some of the states lose stability and oscillations appear using a newly developed
basin bifurcation analysis methodology. Our results reveal that the state of four or five tipped
elements has the largest basin volume for large levels of global warming beyond 4 {\deg}C above pre-industrial
climate conditions. For lower levels of warming, states including disintegrated ice sheets on
West Antarctica and Greenland have higher basin volume than other state configurations. Therefore
in our model, we find that the large ice sheets are of particular importance for Earth system resilience.
We also detect the emergence of limit cycles for 0.6% of all ensemble members at rare parameter combinations.
Such limit cycle oscillations mainly occur between the Greenland Ice Sheet and AMOC (86%), due to
their negative feedback coupling. These limit cycles point to possibly dangerous internal modes
of variability in the climate system that could have played a role in paleoclimatic dynamics such
as those unfolding during the Pleistocene ice age cycles.

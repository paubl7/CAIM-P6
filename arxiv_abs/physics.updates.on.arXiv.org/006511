Protein design is the inverse approach of the three-dimensional (3D) structure prediction for
elucidating the relationship between the 3D structures and amino acid sequences. In general, the
computation of the protein design involves a double loop: a loop for amino acid sequence changes
and a loop for an exhaustive conformational search for each amino acid sequence. Herein, we propose
a novel statistical mechanical design method using Bayesian learning, which can design lattice
proteins without the exhaustive conformational search. We consider a thermodynamic hypothesis
of the evolution of proteins and apply it to the prior distribution of amino acid sequences. Furthermore,
we take the water effect into account in view of the grand canonical picture. As a result, on applying
the 2D lattice hydrophobic-polar (HP) model, our design method successfully finds an amino acid
sequence for which the target conformation has a unique ground state. However, the performance
was not as good for the 3D lattice HP models compared to the 2D models. The performance of the 3D model
improves on using a 20-letter lattice proteins. Furthermore, we find a strong linearity between
the chemical potential of water and the number of surface residues, thereby revealing the relationship
between protein structure and the effect of water molecules. The advantage of our method is that
it greatly reduces computation time, because it does not require long calculations for the partition
function corresponding to an exhaustive conformational search. As our method uses a general form
of Bayesian learning and statistical mechanics and is not limited to lattice proteins, the results
presented here elucidate some heuristics used successfully in previous protein design methods.

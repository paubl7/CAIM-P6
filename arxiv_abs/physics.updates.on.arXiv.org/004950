Relativistic runaway electrons are a major concern in tokamaks. The European framework for Integrated
Modelling (EU-IM), facilitates the integration of different plasma simulation tools by providing
a standard data structure for communication that enables relatively easy integration of different
physics codes. A three-level modelling approach was adopted for runaway electron simulations
within the EU-IM. Recently, a number of runaway electron modelling modules have been integrated
into this framework. The first level of modelling (Runaway Indicator) is limited to the indication
if runaway electron generation is possible or likely. The second level (Runaway Fluid) adopts an
approach similar to e.g. the GO code, using analytical formulas to estimate changes in the runaway
electron current density. The third level is based on the solution of the electron kinetics. One
such code is LUKE that can handle the toroidicity-induced effects by solving the bounce-averaged
Fokker-Planck equation. Another approach is used in NORSE, which features a fully nonlinear collision
operator that makes it capable of simulating major changes in the electron distribution, for example
slide-away. Both codes handle the effect of radiation on the runaway distribution. These runaway-electron
modelling codes are in different stages of integration into the EU-IM infrastructure, and into
the European Transport Simulator (ETS), which is a fully capable modular 1.5D core transport simulator.
ETS with Runaway Fluid was benchmarked to the GO code implementing similar physics. Coherent integration
of kinetic solvers requires more effort on the coupling, especially regarding the definition of
the boundary between runaway and thermal populations, and on consistent calculation of resistivity.
Some of these issues are discussed.

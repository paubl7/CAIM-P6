Social media play a pivotal role in shaping citizens political opinion. According to the Euro-barometer,
the percentage of EU citizens employing online social networks to access information, on a daily
basis, has increased from 18% in 2010 to 42% in 2017. The tight entwinement between social media and
the unfolding of political dynamics has motivated the interest of researchers for the analysis
of users online behavior - with particular emphasis on topics like group polarization during debates
and echo-chambers formation - to unveil the modes and the implications of online interactions for
political processes. In this context, where attention has gone predominantly towards the study
of online relations between users, semantic aspects have remained under-explored. In the present
paper, we aim at filling this gap by, first, identifying the discursive communities that animate
the political debate in the run up of the 2018 Italian Elections and, then, studying the semantic
mechanisms that shape their internal Twitter discussions. We do so by monitoring, on a daily basis,
the structural evolution of the corresponding semantic networks. As our analysis points out, the
supporters of the political alliances present at the elections are characterized by a markedly
different online behavior, in turn inducing semantic networks with different topological structures.
The supporters of the right-wing parties alliance display a particularly active behavior condensed
in a single, densely connected cluster wherein discussions take place in conjunction with mediated
events such as political talk shows. Daily semantic networks triggered by the users retweeting
members of the 5 Star Movement (M5S) tend, instead, to be less centralized suggesting a "more distributed"
way of discussing a variety of themes, e.g. those raised as central by this new incumbent in the Italian
political scenario.

We develop a model of the generation of coherent radio emission in the Crab pulsar, magnetars and
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Emission is produced by a reconnection-generated beam of particles via
a Free Electron Laser (FEL) mechanism, operating in a weakly-turbulent, guide-field dominated
plasma; the radio emission is not rotationally but reconnection powered. Alfvenic turbulence
creates both the FEL wiggler and, via a ponderomotive force, charge bunches in the beam that Compton
scatter the wiggler field coherently. The model is both robust to the underlying plasma parameters
and succeeds in reproducing a number of subtle observed features: (i) emission frequencies depend
mostly on the properties of turbulence and the Lorentz factor of the reconnection generated beam,
$\omega \sim \gamma_0^2 ( c k_w) $ - the emission frequency is independent of the absolute value of
the underlying magnetic field. (ii) The model explains both broadband emission and the presence
of emission stripes, including multiple stripes observed in the High Frequency Interpulse of the
Crab pulsar. (iii) The model reproduces correlated polarization properties: presence of narrow
emission bands in the spectrum favors linear polarization, while broadband emission can have arbitrary
polarization; this matches the FRB phenomenology. (iv) The mechanism is robust to the momentum
spread of the particle beam. (v) The model even reproduces brightness temperatures observed in
FRB and Crab GPs ($\sim 10^{40}$ K and $\sim 10^{33}$ K correspondingly). Presence of several distinct
harmonic wigglers may further enhance the efficiency of the FEL due to large amplitude beat oscillations
and the creation of longer living density patterns. We also discuss a model of wigglers as non-linear
force-free Alfven solitons, limited both in the transverse and longitudinal directions.

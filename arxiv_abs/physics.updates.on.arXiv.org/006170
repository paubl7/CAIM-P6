A novel volume of fluid model (VoF) called explicit volume diffusion (EVD) is developed for the simulation
of interfacial flows, including those with turbulence and primary spray atomisation. The EVD model
is derived by volume averaging the VoF equations over a physically-defined length scale. This introduces
unclosed sub-volume flux, sub-volume stress and volume averaged surface tension force. Sub-volume
fluctuations arise due to both turbulent motions and other interface dynamics which can, in general,
occur in both laminar and turbulent flows. Both of these types of fluctuations are attenuated by
the volume averaging process. The sub-volume flux is closed by a gradient diffusion model and involves
an explicit volume diffusion coefficient that is linked to the physical length scale. The sub-volume
stress closure introduces an explicit volume viscosity augmented by turbulent viscosity in turbulent
flows. The volume averaged surface tension force closure is based on fractal properties of wrinkled
sub-volume interfaces. These closures are evaluated through a priori analysis of resolved flow
simulations for a series of two-dimensional laminar and three-dimensional turbulent interfacial
shear flows. Subsequently, full EVD simulations are validated for these shear flows and for a laboratory
airblast spray jet. Numerical convergence is demonstrated by keeping the physical length scale
constant while reducing the numerical grid size so that numerical diffusion diminishes and becomes
overwhelmed by the explicit volume diffusion. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted for variations
in the physical length scale, which is compared to the boundary layer thickness on the light fluid
side of the interface.

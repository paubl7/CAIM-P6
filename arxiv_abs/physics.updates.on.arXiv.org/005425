Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty (RSA) has become a very common procedure for shoulder joint replacement,
even for scenarios where an anatomical reconstruction would traditionally be used. In this study,
we investigate joint reaction forces and scapular kinematics for rotator cuff tears of different
tendons with and without a reverse prosthesis. Available motion capture data during anterior flexion
was input to a finite-element musculoskeletal shoulder model, and muscle activations were computed
using inverse dynamics. The model was validated with respect to in-vivo glenohumeral joint reaction
force (JRF) measurements, and also compared to existing clinical and biomechanical data. Simulations
were carried out for the intact joint as well as for various tendons involved in a rotator cuff tear:
superior (supraspinatus), superior-anterior (supraspinatus and subscapularis), and superior-posterior
(supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor). Each rotator cuff tear condition was repeated
after shifting the humerus and the glenohumeral joint center of rotation to simulate the effect
of a reverse prosthesis. Changes in compressive, shear, and total JRF were analysed, along with
scapular upward rotation. The model compared favourably to in-vivo measurements, and existing
clinical and biomechanical knowledge. Simulated JRF lie in the ranges of in-vivo JRF measurements
and shows a linear increase past 90 degree flexion. Implanting a reverse prosthesis with a functional
rotator cuff or with an isolated supraspinatus tear led to over 2 times higher compressive force
component than with massive rotator cuff tears (superior-anterior or superior-posterior). Such
higher compression forces might increase the risk of wear and implant fracture.

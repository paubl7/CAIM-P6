Increasing the refractive index available for optical and nanophotonic systems opens new vistas
for design: for applications ranging from broadband metalenses to ultrathin photovoltaics to
high-quality-factor resonators, higher index directly leads to better devices with greater functionality.
Although standard transparent materials have been limited to refractive indices smaller than
3 in the visible, recent metamaterials designs have achieved refractive indices above 5, accompanied
by high losses, and near the phase transition of a ferroelectric perovskite a broadband index above
26 has been claimed. In this work, we derive fundamental limits to the refractive index of any material,
given only the underlying electron density and either the maximum allowable dispersion or the minimum
bandwidth of interest. The Kramers--Kronig relations provide a representation for any passive
(and thereby causal) material, and a well-known sum rule constrains the possible distribution
of oscillator strengths. In the realm of small to modest dispersion, our bounds are closely approached
and not surpassed by a wide range of natural materials, showing that nature has already nearly reached
a Pareto frontier for refractive index and dispersion. Surprisingly, our bound shows a cube-root
dependence on electron density, meaning that a refractive index of 26 over all visible frequencies
is likely impossible. Conversely, for narrow-bandwidth applications, nature does not provide
the highly dispersive, high-index materials that our bounds suggest should be possible. We use
the theory of composites to identify metal-based metamaterials that can exhibit small losses and
sizeable increases in refractive index over the current best materials.

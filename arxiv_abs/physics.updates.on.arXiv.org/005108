Dual-comb sources with equally spaced and low phase noise frequency lines are of great importance
for high resolution spectroscopy and metrology. In the terahertz frequency regime, the electrically
pumped semiconductor quantum cascade lasers (QCLs), demonstrating high output power, good far-field
beam quality, and wide frequency coverage, are suitable candidates for frequency comb and dual-comb
operations. Although free-running terahertz QCLs are able to work as frequency comb and dual-comb
sources, the phase noises originated from the carrier and repetition frequencies' instabilities
are relatively high, which strongly hinder the high precision applications. For a single laser
frequency comb, the repetition frequency can be locked using a microwave injection locking and
the carrier frequency can be locked to a highly stable source. Although these techniques can be,
in principle, applied to a dual-comb laser source, the complexity of simultaneous locking of four
frequencies (two repetition frequencies and two carrier frequencies) makes it difficult to be
implemented friendly. Here, we propose a method to lock a terahertz QCL dual-comb source by phase
locking one of the dual-comb lines to a RF synthesizer. Without a need of locking of carrier offset
and repetition frequencies of the two lasers, the technique can force one of the lasers to follow
the "tone" of the other one. Although only one dual-comb line is locked, the phase noise of other dual-comb
lines can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the dual-comb signal with
the phase locked loop can generate periodic time pulses in a 2 $\mu$s time scale, which further indicates
that the free running terahertz QCL comb can produce pulsed type waveforms without any active or
passive mode locking techniques.

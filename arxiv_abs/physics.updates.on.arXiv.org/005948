The costs for drilling offshore wells are high and hydrocarbons are often located in complex reservoir
formations. To effectively produce from such reservoirs and reduce costs, optimized well placement
in real-time (geosteering) is crucial. Geosteering is usually assisted by an updated formation
evaluation obtained by well-log interpretation while drilling. A reliable, computationally
efficient, and robust workflow to interpret well logs and capture uncertainties in real-time is
necessary for this application. An iterative ensemble-based method, namely the approximate Levenberg
Marquardt form of the Ensemble Randomized Maximum Likelihood (LM-EnRML) is integrated in our formation
evaluation workflow. We estimate model parameters, resistivity and density in addition to boundary
locations, and related uncertainties by reducing the statistical misfit between the measurements
from the well logging tools and the theoretical measurements from the forward tool simulators.
The results of analyzing several synthetic cases with several types of logs verified that the proposed
method can give good estimate of model parameters. By comparing the CPU time, we conclude that the
proposed method has at least about 10--125 times lower computational time compare to a common statistical
method, such as Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo. In addition, the ensemble-based method can run
in parallel on multiple CPUs. Testing the method on a case inspired from a real field also yielded
accurate formation evaluation. Thus, the proposed ensemble-based method has been proven robust
and computationally efficient to estimate petrophysical formation properties, layer boundaries
and their uncertainties, indicating that it is suitable for geosteering.

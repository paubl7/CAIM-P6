Waveplates having spatially varying fast-axis orientation and retardance provide an elegant
and easy way to locally manipulate different attributes of light beams namely, polarization, amplitude
and phase, leading to the generation of exotic structured light beams. The fabrication of such doubly
inhomogeneous waveplates (d-plates) is more complex, compared to that of singly inhomogeneous
waveplates (s-plates) having uniform retardance, which can be easily fabricated by different
means such as photoalignment of liquid crystals, metasurfaces etc. Here, exploiting the SU(2)
formalism, we establish analytically that any d-plate can be equivalently implemented using a
pair of quarter-wave s-plates and a half-wave s-plate. An important advantage of this method is
that it gives the flexibility to realize a whole family of distinct d-plates using the same triplet
of s-plates. To underline the scope of this method, we propose novel d-plates for spatially tailoring
the phase and complex amplitudes of light beams. Towards complex amplitude shaping, we present
a generic method for carving out higher-order eigenmodes of light using a d-plate in conjugation
with a polarizer. A generalized q-plate-like gadget, for imparting a polarization-dependent
phase profile to a scalar light beam, is proposed as a demonstration of phase-polarization interplay.
For these two illustrations, the corresponding three-s-plate gadget is constructed, and its functioning
is validated with extensive numerical simulations. The main result and its illustrations are generic
and agnostic to the way the s-plates are fabricated and we believe they carry the potential to push
the current state of the art in interdisciplinary applications involving structured light beams.

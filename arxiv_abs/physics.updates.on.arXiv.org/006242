Spintronics-based nonvolatile components in neuromorphic circuits offer the possibility of
realizing novel functionalities at low power. Current-controlled electrical switching of magnetization
is actively researched in this context. Complex oxide heterostructures with perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy (PMA), consisting of SrRuO3 (SRO) grown on SrTiO3 (STO) are strong material contenders.
Utilizing the crystal orientation, magnetic anisotropy in such simple heterostructures can be
tuned to either exhibit a perfect or slightly tilted PMA. Here, we investigate current-induced
magnetization modulation in such tailored ferromagnetic layers with a material with strong spin-orbit
coupling (Pt), exploiting the spin Hall effect. We find significant differences in the magnetic
anisotropy between the SRO/STO heterostructures, as manifested in the first and second harmonic
magnetoresistance measurements. Current-induced magnetization switching can be realized with
spin-orbit torques, but for systems with perfect PMA this switching is probabilistic as a result
of the high symmetry. Slight tilting of the PMA can break this symmetry and allow the realization
of deterministic switching. Control over the magnetic anisotropy of our heterostructures therefore
provides control over the manner of switching. Based on our findings, we propose a three-terminal
spintronic memristor, with a magnetic tunnel junction design, that shows several resistive states
controlled by electric charge. Non-volatile states can be written through SOT by applying an in-plane
current, and read out as a tunnel current by applying a small out-of-plane current. Depending on
the anisotropy of the SRO layer, the writing mechanism is either deterministic or probabilistic
allowing for different functionalities to emerge. We envisage that the probabilistic MTJs could
be used as synapses while the deterministic devices can emulate neurons

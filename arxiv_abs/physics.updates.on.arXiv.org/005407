Replacing the canonical pair q and p of the harmonic oscillator (HO) by the locally and symplectically
equivalent pair angle phi and action variable I implies a qualitative change of the global topological
structure of the associated phase spaces: the pair (q,p) is an element of a topologically trivial
plane R^2 whereas the pair (phi,I>0) is an element of a topologically non-trivial, infinitely connected,
punctured plane R^2-{0}, which has the group SO(1,2) as its "canonical" group. Due to its infinitely
many covering groups the resulting ("symplectic") spectrum of the associated quantum Hamiltonian
is given by {hbar omega (n+b), n =0,1,...; b in (0,1]}, in contrast to the "orthodox" spectrum {hbar
omega (n+1/2)}. The potentially most important implications concern the vibrations of diatomic
molecules in the infrared, e.g. those of molecular hydrogen H_2. Those symplectic spectra of the
HO may provide a simultaneous key to two outstanding astrophysical puzzles, namely the nature of
dark (vacuum) energy and that of dark matter: To the former because the zero-point energy b hbar omega
of free electromagnetic wave oscillator modes can be extremely small > 0 (b ca. exp(-35) for the measured
dark energy density). And a key to the dark matter problem because the quantum zero-point energies
of the Born-Oppenheimer potentials in which the two nuclei of H_2 or the nuclei of other primordial
diatomic molecules vibrate can be lower, too, and, therefore, may lead to spectrally detuned "dark"
H_2 molecules during the "Dark Ages" of the universe and forming WIMPs in the hypothesized sense.
All results appear to be in surprisingly good agreement with the LambdaCDM model of the universe.
Besides laboratory experiments the search for 21-cm radio signals from the Dark Ages of the universe
and other astrophysical observations can help to explore those hypothetical implications.

Geostationary observations offer the unique opportunity to resolve the diurnal cycle of the Earth's
Radiation Budget at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), crucial for climate-change studies. However,
a drawback of the continuous temporal coverage of the geostationary orbit is the fixed viewing geometry.
As a consequence, errors in the angular distribution models (ADMs) used in the radiance-to-flux
conversion process can result in systematic errors of the estimated radiative fluxes. In this work,
focusing on clear-sky reflected TOA observations, we compare the overlapping views from Meteosat
Second Generation satellites at 0{\deg} and 41.5{\deg}E longitude which enable a quantification
of viewing-angle-dependent differences. Using data derived from the Spinning Enhanced Visible
and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI), we identify some of the main sources of discrepancies, and show that
they can be significantly reduced at the level of one month. This is achieved, separately for each
satellite, via a masking procedure followed by an empirical fit at the pixel-level that takes into
account all the clear-sky data from that satellite, calculated separately per timeslot of the day,
over the month of November 2016. The method is then applied to each month of 2017, and gives a quadratic
mean of the albedo root-mean squared difference over the dual-view region which is comparable from
month to month, with a 2017 average value of 0.01. Sources of discrepancies include the difficulty
to estimate the flux over the sunglint ocean region close to the limbs, the absence of dedicated angular
distribution models for the aerosol-over-ocean case in the data processing, and the existence
of an observer-dependent diurnal-asymmetry artefact affecting the clear-sky-albedo dependence
on the solar zenith angle particularly over land areas.

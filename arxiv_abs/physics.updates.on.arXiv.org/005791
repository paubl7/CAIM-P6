Mobility restriction is considered one of the main policies to contain COVID-10 spreading. However,
there are multiple ways to reduce mobility via differentiated restrictions, and it is not easy to
predict the actual impact on virus spreading. This is a limitation for policy-makers who need to
implement effective and timely measures. Notwithstanding the big role of data analysis to understand
this phenomenon, it is also important to have more general models capable of predicting the impact
of different scenarios. Besides, they should be able to simulate scenarios in a disaggregated way,
so to understand the possible impact of targeted strategies, e.g. on a geographical scale or in relation
to other variables associated with the potential risk of infection. This paper presents an agent-based
model (ABM) able to dynamically simulate the COVID-19 spreading under different mobility restriction
scenarios. The model uses the Italian case study with its 20 administrative regions and considers
parameters that can be attributed to the diffusion and lethality of the virus (based on a virus spread
risk model) and population mobility patterns. The model is calibrated with real data and reproduces
the impact that different mobility restrictions can have on the pandemic diffusion based on a combination
of static and dynamic parameters. Results suggest that virus spreading would have been similar
if differentiated mobility restriction strategies based on a-priori risk parameters instead
of a national lockdown would have been put in place in Italy during the first wave of the pandemic.
The proposed model could give useful suggestions for decision-makers to tackle pandemics and virus
spreading at a strategic level.

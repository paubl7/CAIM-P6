For single source helical Computed Tomography (CT), both Filtered-Back Projection (FBP) and statistical
iterative reconstruction have been investigated. However for dual source CT with flying focal
spot (DS-FFS CT), statistical iterative reconstruction that accurately models the scanner geometry
and acquisition physics remains unknown to researchers. Therefore, our purpose is to present a
novel physics based iterative reconstruction method for DS-FFS CT and assess its image quality.
Our algorithm uses precise physics models to reconstruct from the native cone-beam geometry and
interleaved dual source helical trajectory of a DS-FFS CT. To do so, we construct a noise physics
model to represent data acquisition noise and a prior image model to represent image noise and texture.
In addition, we design forward geometry models to compute the locations of deflected focal spots,
the dimension and sensitivity of voxels and detector units, as well as the length of intersection
between X-rays and voxels. The forward geometry models further represent the coordinated movement
between the dual sources by computing their X-ray coverage gaps and overlaps. With the above models,
we use Consensus Equilibrium (CE) numerical method to reconstruct images by computing the MAP estimate
of the models. We compared our reconstruction with Siemens ADMIRE, which is the clinical standard
iterative reconstruction (IR) method for DS-FFS CT, in terms of spatial resolution, noise profile
and image artifacts through both phantoms and clinical thoracic scan datasets. Experiments show
that our reconstruction has a higher spatial resolution, with a Task-Based Modulation Transfer
Function consistently higher than the clinical standard IR. In addition, our reconstruction shows
a reduced magnitude of image undersampling artifacts than the clinical standard IR.

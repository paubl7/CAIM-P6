Direct numerical simulations of free round jets at a Reynolds number ($Re_{D}$) of $5000$, based
on jet diameter ($D$) and jet-exit bulk velocity ($U_{e}$), are performed to study jet turbulence
characteristics at supercritical pressures. The jet consists of Nitrogen ($\mathrm{N_{2}}$)
that is injected into $\mathrm{N_{2}}$ at same temperature. To understand turbulent mixing, a
passive scalar is transported with the flow at unity Schmidt number. Two sets of inflow conditions
that model jets issuing from either a smooth contraction nozzle (laminar inflow) or a long pipe nozzle
(turbulent inflow) are considered. By changing one parameter at a time, the simulations examine
the jet-flow sensitivity to the thermodynamic compressibility factor ($Z$), inflow condition,
and pressure ($p$) spanning perfect- to real-gas conditions. The inflow affects flow statistics
in the near-field (containing the potential core closure and the transition region) as well as further
downstream (containing fully-developed flow with self-similar statistics) at both atmospheric
and supercritical $p$. The sensitivity to inflow is larger in the transition region, where the laminar-inflow
jets exhibit dominant coherent structures that produce higher mean strain rates and higher turbulent
kinetic energy than in turbulent-inflow jets. Decreasing $Z$ at a fixed supercritical ambient
pressure ($p_{\infty}$) enhances pressure and density fluctuations (non-dimensionalized by
local mean pressure and density, respectively), but the effect on velocity fluctuations depends
also on local flow dynamics. When $Z$ is reduced, large mean strain rates in the transition region
of laminar-inflow jets significantly enhance velocity fluctuations (non-dimensionalized by
local mean velocity) and scalar mixing, whereas the effects of decreasing $Z$ are minimal in jets
from turbulent inflow.

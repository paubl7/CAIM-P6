Increased research interest and economic activity in the Arctic raise the need for new observations
of sea ice dynamics. Remote sensing as well as mathematical and numerical models of wave propagation
in sea ice would benefit from more in situ data for validation. This study presents wave measurements
in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) obtained from ship mounted sensors. The system combines altimeter
readings from the ship bow with ship motion correction data to provide estimated single point ocean
surface elevation. Significant wave height and mean wave period, as well as one-dimensional wave
spectra are derived from the combined measurements. The results are compared with integrated parameters
from a spectral wave model over a period of eight days in the open ocean, and with spectra and integrated
parameters derived from motion detecting instruments placed on ice floes inside the MIZ. Mean absolute
errors of the integrated parameters are in the range 15.0-18.9% when comparing with the spectral
wave model and 1.0-9.6% when comparing with valid motion detecting instruments. The spatial wave
damping coefficient is estimated by looking at the change in spectral wave amplitude found at discrete
frequency values as the ship was moving along the longitudinal direction of the MIZ within time intervals
where the wave field is found to be approximately constant in time. As expected from theory, high
frequency waves are effectively dampened by the presence of sea ice. The observed wave attenuation
rates compare favourably with a two-layer dissipation model. Our methodology can be regarded as
a simple and reliable way to collect more waves-in-ice data as it can be easily added to any ship participating
to ice expeditions, at little extra cost.

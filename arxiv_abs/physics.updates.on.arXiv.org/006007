Reconstruction of turbulent flow based on data assimilation methods is of significant importance
for improving the estimation of flow characteristics by incorporating limited observations.
Existing works mainly focus on using only one observation data source, e.g., velocity, wall pressure,
lift or drag force, to reconstruct the flow. In practical applications observations are disparate
data sources that often vary in dimension and quality. Simultaneously incorporating these disparate
data is worth investigation to improve the flow reconstruction. In this work, we investigate the
disparate data assimilation with ensemble methods to enhance the reconstruction of turbulent
mean flows. Specifically, a regularized ensemble Kalman method is employed to incorporate the
observation of velocity and different sources of wall quantities (e.g., wall shear stress, wall
pressure distribution, lift and drag force). Three numerical examples are used to demonstrate
the capability of the proposed framework for assimilating disparate observation data. The first
two cases, i.e., a one-dimensional planar channel flow and a two-dimensional transitional flow
over plate, are used to incorporate both the sparse velocity and wall friction. In the third case
of the flow over periodic hills, the wall pressure distribution and the lift and drag force are regarded
as observation in addition to velocity, to recover the flow fields. The results demonstrate the
merits of incorporating various disparate data sources to improve the accuracy of the flow-field
estimation. The ensemble-based method can assimilate disparate data non-intrusively and robustly
without requiring significant changes to the model simulation codes. The method demonstrated
here opens up possibilities for assimilating realistic experimental data, which are often disparate.

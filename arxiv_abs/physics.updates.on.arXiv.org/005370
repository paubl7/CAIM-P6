The extent of mixed regions around convective zones is one of the biggest uncertainties in stellar
evolution. 1D overshooting descriptions introduce a free parameter ($f_{ov}$) that is in general
not well constrained from observations. Especially in small central convective regions the value
is highly uncertain due to its tight connection to the pressure scale height. Long-term multi-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations can be used to study the size of the overshooting region and the involved
mixing processes. Here we show how one can calibrate an overshooting parameter by performing 2D
Maestro simulations of Zero-Age-Main-Sequence stars ranging from $1.3$ to $3.5 M_\odot$. The
simulations cover the convective cores of the stars and a large fraction of the surrounding radiative
envelope. We follow the convective flow for at least 20 convective turnover times, while the longest
simulation covers 430 turnover time scales. This allows us to study how the mixing as well as the convective
boundary evolve with time, and how the resulting entrainment can be interpreted in terms of overshooting
parameters. We find that increasing the overshooting parameter $f_{ov}$ beyond a certain value
in the initial model of our simulations, changes the mixing behaviour completely. This result can
be used to put limits on the overshooting parameter. We find $0.010 < f_{ov} < 0.017$ to be in good agreement
with our simulations of a $3.5 M_\odot$ mass star. We also identify a diffusive mixing component
due to internal gravity waves (IGW) that is active throughout the convectively stable layer, but
likely overestimated in our simulations. Furthermore, applying our calibration method to simulations
of less massive stars suggests a need for a mass-dependent overshooting description where the mixing
in terms of the pressure scale height is reduced for small convective cores.

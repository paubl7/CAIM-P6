The prediction of aircraft aerodynamic quantities of interest remains among the most pressing
challenges for computational fluid dynamics. The aircraft aerodynamics are inherently turbulent
with mean-flow three-dimensionality, often accompanied by laminar-to-turbulent transition,
flow separation, secondary flow motions at corners, and shock wave formation, to name a few. However,
the most widespread wall models are built upon the assumption of statistically-in-equilibrium
wall-bounded turbulence and do not faithfully account for the wide variety of flow conditions described
above. This raises the question of how to devise models capable of accounting for such a vast and rich
collection of flow physics in a feasible manner. In this work, we propose tackling the wall-modeling
challenge by devising the flow as a collection of building blocks, whose information enables the
prediction of the stress as the wall. The model relies on the assumption that simple canonical flows
contain the essential flow physics to devise accurate models. Three types of building block units
were used to train the model: turbulent channel flows, turbulent ducts and turbulent boundary layers
with separation. This limited training set will be extended in future versions of the model. The
approach is implemented using two interconnected artificial neural networks: a classifier, which
identifies the contribution of each building block in the flow; and a predictor, which estimates
the wall stress via non-linear combinations of building-block units. The output of the model is
accompanied by the confidence in the prediction. The latter value aids the detection of areas where
the model underperforms, such as flow regions that are not representative of the building blocks
used to train the model. The model is validated in a unseen case representative of external aerodynamic
applications: the NASA Juncture Flow Experiment.

With the expansion of renewable energies in Germany, imminent grid congestion events occur more
often. One approach for avoiding curtailment of renewable energies is to cover excess feed-in by
demand response. As curtailment is often a local phenomenon, in this work we determine the regional
demand response potential for the 401 German administrative districts. The load regionalisation
is based on weighting factors derived from population and employment statistics, locations of
industrial facilities, etc. Using periodic and temperature-dependent load profiles and technology
specific parameters, load shifting potentials were determined with a temporal resolution of 15
minutes. Our analysis yields that power-to-heat technologies provide the highest potentials,
followed by residential appliances, commercial and industrial loads. For the considered 2030
scenario, power-to-gas and e-mobility also contribute a significant potential. The cumulated
load increase potential of all technologies ranges from $5 - 470~MW$ per administrative district.
The median value is $25~MW$, which would suffice to avoid the curtailment of 8 classical wind turbines.
Further, we calculated load shifting cost-potential curves for each district. Industrial processes
and power-to-heat in district heating have the lowest load shifting investment cost, due to the
largest installed capacities per facility. We distinguished between different size classes of
the installed capacity of heat pumps, yielding $23\%$ lower average investment cost for heat pump
flexibilisation in the city of Berlin compared to a rural district. The variable costs of most considered
load shifting technologies remain under the average compensation costs for curtailment of renewable
energies of $110~\text{\euro{}}/MWh$. As all results and the developed code are published under
open source licenses, they can be integrated into energy system models.

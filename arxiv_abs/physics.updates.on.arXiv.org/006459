Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) is an emerging imaging modality for breast imaging that
can produce quantitative images that depict the acoustic properties of tissues. Computer-simulation
studies, also known as virtual imaging trials, provide researchers with an economical and convenient
route to systematically explore imaging system designs and image reconstruction methods. When
simulating an imaging technology intended for clinical use, it is essential to employ realistic
numerical phantoms that can facilitate the objective, or task-based, assessment of image quality.
Moreover, when computing objective image quality measures, an ensemble of such phantoms should
be employed that display the variability in anatomy and object properties that is representative
of the to-be-imaged patient cohort. Such stochastic phantoms for clinically relevant applications
of USCT are currently lacking. In this work, a methodology for producing realistic three-dimensional
(3D) numerical breast phantoms for enabling clinically relevant computer-simulation studies
of USCT breast imaging is presented. By extending and adapting an existing stochastic 3D breast
phantom for use withUSCT, methods for creating ensembles of numerical acoustic breast phantoms
are established. These breast phantoms will possess clinically relevant variations in breast
size, composition, acoustic properties, tumor locations, and tissue textures. To demonstrate
the use of the phantoms in virtual USCT studies, two brief case studies are presented that address
the development and assessment of image reconstruction procedures. Examples of breast phantoms
produced by use of the proposed methods and a collection of 52 sets of simulated USCT measurement
data have been made open source for use in image reconstruction development

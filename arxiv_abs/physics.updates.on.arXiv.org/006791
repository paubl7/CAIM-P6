This paper presents a three-dimensional analytical study of the intrinsic free vibration of an
elastic multilayered hollow sphere interacting with an exterior non-Newtonian fluid medium.
The fluid is assumed to be characterized by a compressible linear viscoelastic model accounting
for both the shear and compressional relaxation processes. For small-amplitude vibrations, the
equations governing the viscoelastic fluid can be linearized, which are then solved by introducing
appropriate potential functions. The solid is assumed to exhibit a particular material anisotropy,
i.e. spherical isotropy, which includes material isotropy as a special case. The equations governing
the anisotropic solid are solved in spherical coordinates using the state-space formalism, which
finally establishes two separate transfer relations correlating the state vectors at the innermost
surface with those at the outermost surface of the multilayered hollow sphere. By imposing the continuity
conditions at the fluid-solid interface, two separate analytical characteristic equations are
derived, which characterize two independent classes of vibration. Numerical examples are finally
conducted to validate the theoretical derivation as well as to investigate the effects of various
factors, including fluid viscosity and compressibility, fluid viscoelasticity, solid anisotropy
and surface effect, as well as solid intrinsic damping, on the vibration characteristics of the
submerged hollow sphere. Particularly, our theoretically predicted vibration frequencies and
quality factors of gold nanospheres with intrinsic damping immersed in water agree exceptionally
well with the available experimentally measured results. The reported analytical solution is
truly and fully three-dimensional, covering from the purely radial breathing mode to torsional
mode to any general spheroidal mode.

The aim of this study is to estimate the intrinsic efficiency and energy resolution of different
types of solid-state gamma-ray detectors in order to generate a precise dual-energy x-ray beam
from the conventional x-ray tube using external x-ray filters. The x-ray spectrum of a clinical
x-ray tube was experimentally measured using a high purity Germanium detector (HPGe) and the obtained
spectrum validated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The obtained x-ray spectrum from the experiment
was employed to assess the energy resolution and detection efficiency of different inorganic scintillators
and semiconductor-based solid-state detectors, namely HPGe, BGO, NaI, and LYSO, using MC simulations.
The best performing detector was employed to experimentally create and measure a dual-energy x-ray
spectrum through applying attenuating filters to the original x-ray beam. The simulation results
indicated a 9.16% energy resolution for the HPGe detector wherein the FWHM of the energy resolution
for the HPGe detector was about 1/3rd of the other inorganic detectors. The x-ray spectra estimated
from the various source energies exhibited a good agreement between experimental and simulation
results with a maximum difference of 6%. Owing to the high-energy discrimination power of the HPGe
detector, a dual-energy x-ray spectrum was created and measured from the original x-ray spectrum
using 0.5 and 4.5 mm Aluminum external filters, which involves 70 and 140 keV energy peaks with 8%
overlap. The experimental measurements and MC simulations of the HPGe detector exhibited close
agreement in high-energy resolution estimation of the x-ray spectrum. Given the accurate measurement
of the x-ray spectrum with the HPGe detector, a dual-energy x-ray spectrum was generated with minimal
energy overlap using external x-ray filters.

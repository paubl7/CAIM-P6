A large diffusive turbulent contribution to the radial impurity transport in Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X)
plasmas has been experimentally inferred during the first campaigns and numerically confirmed
by means of gyrokinetic simulations with the code stella. In general, the absence of strong impurity
accumulation during the initial W7-X campaigns is attributed to this diffusive term. In the present
work the diffusive contribution is also calculated in other stellarator plasmas. In particular,
the diffusion (D) and convection (V) coefficients of carbon and iron impurities produced by ion-temperature-gradient
(ITG) turbulence are obtained for W7-X, LHD, TJ-II and NCSX. The results show that, although the
size of D and V can differ across the four devices, inward convection is found for all of them. For W7-X,
TJ-II and NCSX the two coefficients are comparable and the turbulent peaking factor is surprisingly
similar. In LHD, appreciably weaker diffusive and convective impurity transport and significantly
larger turbulent peaking factor are predicted. All this suggests that ITG turbulence, although
not strongly, would lead to negative impurity density gradients in stellarators. Then, considering
mixed ITG/Trapped Electron Mode (TEM) turbulence for the specific case of W7-X, it has been quantitatively
assessed to what degree pellet fueled reduced turbulence scenarios feature reduced turbulent
transport of impurities as well. The results for trace iron impurities show that, although their
turbulent transport is not entirely suppressed, a significant reduction of V and a stronger decrease
of D are found. Although the diffusion is still above neoclassical levels, the neoclassical convection
would gain under such conditions a greater specific weight on the dynamics of impurities in comparison
with standard ECRH scenarios.

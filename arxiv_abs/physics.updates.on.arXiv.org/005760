Aims. We investigate the configuration of a complex flux rope above a {\delta} sunspot region in
NOAA AR 11515, and its eruptive expansion during a confined M5.3-class flare. Methods. We study
the formation of the {\delta} sunspot using continuum intensity images and photospheric vector
magnetograms provided by SDO/HMI. We use EUV and UV images provided by SDO/AIA, and hard X-ray emission
recorded by RHESSI to investigate the eruptive details. The coronal magnetic field is extrapolated
with a non-linear force free field (NLFFF) method, based on which the flux rope is identified by calculating
the twist number Tw and squashing factor Q. We search the null point via a modified Powell hybrid method.
Results. The collision between two emerging spot groups form the {\delta} sunspot. A bald patch
(BP) forms at the collision location, above which a complex flux rope is identified. The flux rope
has multiple layers, with one compact end and one bifurcated end, having Tw decreasing from the core
to the boundary. A null point is located above the flux rope. The eruptive process consists of precursor
flaring at a 'v'-shaped coronal structure, rise of the filament, and flaring below the filament,
corresponding well with the NLFFF topological structures, including the null point and the flux
rope with BP and hyperbolic flux tube (HFT). Two sets of post-flare loops and three flare ribbons
support the bifurcation configuration of the flux rope. Conclusions. The precursor reconnection,
which occurs at the null point, weakens the overlying confinement to allow the flux rope to rise,
fitting the breakout model. The main phase reconnection, which may occur at the BP or HFT, facilitates
the flux rope rising. The results suggest that the {\delta} spot configuration presents an environment
prone to the formation of complex magnetic configurations which will work together to produce activities.

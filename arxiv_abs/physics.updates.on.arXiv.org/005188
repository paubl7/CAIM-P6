Superconducting electromechanical devices offer unique pathways towards manipulating both
nanomechanical motions and microwave signals via strong electromechanical coupling at the nanoscale.
This coupling leads to the parametric interaction of nanomechanical resonance modes and superconducting
microwave cavities, enabling their mutual energy exchange. Such electromechanical devices have
recently shown their operations in the quantum regime, demonstrating cooling, squeezing, and
amplification of mechanical motions, photon-phonon entanglement, electromechanically induced
transparency, and nonreciprocal microwave transmission. Though these examples show their great
promise, the conditions for their reliable operations are limited by superconducting critical
temperature (1.2 K) and magnetic field (0.01 T) of aluminum. Extending the operating conditions
of the devices is strongly desired to utilize their versatility as nanomechanical sensors and microwave
components for quantum technologies. Here we describe the realization of an electromechanical
transducer with superconducting niobium and demonstrate their operations at 4.2 K and in strong
magnetic fields (up to 0.8 T). We show that the micro-fabricated niobium microwave resonator exhibits
relatively high quality factor (~ 4,000) at 4.2 K and preserves its microwave resonance even in external
magnetic fields. We demonstrate efficient back-action cooling and amplification of nanomechanical
motions, and electromechanically induced reflection of microwave signals. We also experimentally
show the detection of nanomechanical motions in 0.8 T magnetic field, manifesting the potential
for exploring spin-phonon interactions using the niobium device. With its ability to control and
readout nanomechanical motions simultaneously, the superconducting electromechanical transducer
could provide powerful sensing platforms.

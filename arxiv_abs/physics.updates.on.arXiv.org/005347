Urban population density provides a good perspective for understand urban growth and spatial dynamics.
Based on sub-district data of the four times of national population censuses in 1964, 1982, 1990
and 2000, this paper is devoted to making phrase analyses of urban growth and the spatial restructuring
of population in the city of Hangzhou, China. Research methods are based on mathematical modeling
and field investigation. The result shows that the negative exponential function and the power-exponential
function can be well fitted to Hangzhou's observational data of urban density. The gradient and
latent scaling exponent of these models are linear correlated to the spatial information entropy
of population distribution. The gradient in the negative exponential function flattened in the
1990s is closely related to the development of suburbanization. In terms of investigation materials
and the changing trend of model parameters, we can reveal the spatio-temporal features of Hangzhou's
urban growth. The main conclusions can be reached as follows. The policy of reformation and opening-up
and the establishment of a market economy improved the development mode of Hangzhou. Before 1982,
the driving force of urban development was the simple top-down force based on command economics,
while after 1982, the dual force based on both the top-down government management and bottom-up
market economics influence urban growth. New changes in Hangzhou after 1982 include the development
of transportation facilities and fast growing of automobiles, the renovation of the core and the
construction of new residential quarters in suburbs, and the reform of urban land use system and
the spatial pattern of land and housing price. The resultant of forces of these changes derived suburbanization
and decentralization of population in the city.

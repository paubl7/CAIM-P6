The application of topological phases in classical mechanical systems is unlocking previously
unattainable topologically insulated waves in acoustic, phononic, and elastic media. Mechanical
topological insulators are well understood for linear and weakly nonlinear systems, however traditional
analysis methods break down for strongly nonlinear systems since linear methods can not be applied
in that case. We study one such system in the form of a one-dimensional mechanical analog of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
interface model with strong nonlinearity of the cubic form. The frequency-energy dependence of
the nonlinear bulk modes and topologically insulated mode is explored using Numerical continuation
of the system's nonlinear normal modes (NNMs), and the linear stability of the NNMs are investigated
using Floquet Multipliers (FMs) and Krein signature analysis. We find that the nonlinear topological
lattice supports a family of topologically insulated NNMs that are parameterized by the total energy
of the system and are stable within a range of frequencies. We empirically recover the geometric
Zak phase to determine at which energies the nontrivial phase conditions cease to exists using numerical
simulations to predict a critical energy level after which the insulated mode does not exist. We
compare the predictions from FM analysis and the numerical phase analysis by numerically investigating
the interface system for harmonic excitation applied to the interface site. It is shown that empirical
calculations of the geometric Zak Phase lead to reliable measures for predicting the existence
of the topological mode in the nonlinear system, and that while the FMs of the NNMs are dependable
predictors of the NNMs stability, they are not sufficient measures for predicting at which energies
the topological mode can be excited.

Visible-light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols within the boundary layer affect the radiance
and polarization states of the radiation at the top of the atmosphere. Remote sensing from suborbital
and satellite-based platforms utilizes these radiance and polarization signals to retrieve the
key properties of these aerosols. Recent retrieval algorithms have shown a progressive trend toward
including multi-angular and multi-spectral polarimetric measurements to produce better retrieval
accuracy in comparison to those using measurements based on a single viewing angle. Here, we perform
a theoretical investigation of the top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance-related reflectance factor
(bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF)) and the two types of polarimetry-related factors (polarized
bidirectional reflectance factor (pBRF) and the degree of linear polarization (DoLP)) for different
types of atmospheric light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols as a function of particle size distribution.
We selected three polarimetric bands corresponding to those utilized by NASA Airborne Multiangle
SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI) -- near-UV (470 nm), visible (660 nm), and near-infrared
(865 nm) -- for our simulations which were performed over ocean surface using the successive order
of scattering (SOS) algorithm coupled to a Lorenz-Mie aerosol optics model. The analysis of particle
phase matrix elements indicates a close relationship between the angular dependencies of DoLP
and associated phase matrix components at the shortest polarimetric band (470 nm). Using Jacobian
analysis, we find that the radiance- and polarimetry-related reflectance factors of weakly light-absorbing
aerosols, such as brown carbon, are more sensitive to changes in particle size and imaginary refractive
index in comparison with those of black carbon, which is strongly light-absorbing.

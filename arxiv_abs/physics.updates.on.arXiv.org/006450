As recent advancements in physics and astronomy rapidly rewrite textbooks, there is a growing need
in keeping abreast of the latest knowledge in these fields. Reading preprints is one of the effective
ways to do this. By having journal clubs where people can read and discuss journals together, the
benefits of reading journals become more prevalent. We present an investigative study of understanding
the factors that affect the success of preprint journal clubs in astronomy, more commonly known
as Astro-ph/Astro-Coffee (hereafter called AC). A survey was disseminated to understand how institutions
from different countries implement AC. We interviewed 9 survey respondents and from their responses
we identified four important factors that make AC successful: commitment (how the organizer and
attendees participate in AC), environment (how conducive and comfortable AC is conducted), content
(the discussed topics in AC and how they are presented), and objective (the main goal/s of conducting
AC). We also present the format of our AC, an elective class which was evaluated during the Spring
Semester 2020 (March 2020 - June 2020). Our evaluation with the attendees showed that enrollees
(those who are enrolled and are required to present papers regularly) tend to be more committed in
attending compared to audiences (those who are not enrolled and are not required to present papers
regularly). In addition, participants tend to find papers outside their research field harder
to read. Finally, we showed an improvement in the weekly number of papers read after attending AC
of those who present papers regularly, and a high satisfaction rating of our AC. We summarize the
areas of improvement in our AC implementation, and we encourage other institutions to evaluate
their own AC in accordance with the four aforementioned factors to assess the effectiveness of their
AC in reaching their goals.

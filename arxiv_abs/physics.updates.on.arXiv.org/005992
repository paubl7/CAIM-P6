Large Eddy Simulation with a Perfectly Stirred Reactor model (LES-PSR) is developed to simulate
supersonic combustion with high-enthalpy flow conditions. The PSR model considers the viscous
heating and compressibility effects on the thermo-chemical state, through correcting the chemical
source term for progress variable and incorporating absolute enthalpy as the control variable
for the look-up table. It is firstly validated by using a priori analysis of the viscous heating and
compressibility effects. Then an auto-igniting hydrogen flame stabilized in supersonic vitiated
co-flowing jet is simulated with LES-PSR method. The results show that the shock wave structure,
overall flame characteristics, flame-shock interaction and lift-off height are accurately captured.
Good agreements of the velocity and mixture fraction statistics with the experimental data are
observed. The results also show that the LES-PSR model can predict the mean temperature and mole
fractions of major species quite well in both flame induction and stabilization zones. However,
there are some under-predictions of temperature RMS by about 100-150 K, which may be due to the chemical
non-equilibrium in the H2/O2-enriched combustion product of the co-flowing jet. The scatter plots
of two probe locations respectively from induction and flame zones show that the respective flame
structures in mixture fraction space are captured well. However, the flucturations of the temperature
and species mole fractions are under-predicted in the flame zone. The shock-induced auto-igniting
spots are captured by the PSR model. These spots are highly unsteady and play an important role in
flame stabilization. It is also shown that the intense reactions are initiated at mixture fractions
around the stoichiometry or fuel-lean values, corresponding to local elevated pressure (1.5-2.0
atm) due to shock compression.

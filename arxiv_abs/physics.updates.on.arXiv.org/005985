Here we present datasets of daily variation obtained from the geomagnetic field raw observations
recorded at the Coimbra Magnetic Observatory (COI, Portugal) in 2007-2017, covering almost the
entire solar cycle 24. Two methods were used to extract daily variability from the raw geomagnetic
hourly data. The first method uses the so-called geomagnetically quiet days to calculate S-type
variations as daily means resulting in the data sub-set named IQD Sq and SD. The second method uses
the principal component analysis (PCA) to decompose the original series into main variability
modes. The first three modes produced by PCA and explaining up to 98 per cent of the variability of
the raw data are in the data sub-set named PCA modes. Both methods allow to extract regular geomagnetic
field variations related to daily variations (S-type variations) in the ionospheric dynamo region
and some magnetospheric currents. The COI location near the mean latitude of the ionospheric Sq
current vortex focus allows studying its variability using the S-type regular variations of the
geomagnetic field measured near the ground. The S-type variations for the X and Y components of the
geomagnetic field obtained at the COI observatory can also be re-scaled and used to analyze field
variations obtained at other European geomagnetic observatories at close latitudes. The S-type
variations for the Z component of the geomagnetic field obtained at the COI observatory can be compared
to similar variations observed at more continental regions to study the so-called coastal effect
in the geomagnetic field variations. The dataset described in this paper is analyzed in a companion

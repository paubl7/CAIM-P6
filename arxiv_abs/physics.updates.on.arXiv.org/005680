This study introduces the HYPERSCINT research platform, the first commercially available scintillation
dosimetry platform capable of multi-point dosimetry through the hyperspectral approach. Optic
and dosimetric performances of the system were investigated through comparison with another commercially
available solution, the Ocean Optics QE65Pro spectrometer. The optical characterization was
accomplished by measuring the linearity of the signal as a function of integration time, photon
detection efficiency and spectral resolution for both systems. Dosimetric performances were
then evaluated with a 3-point plastic scintillator detector (mPSD) in terms of signal to noise ratio
(SNR) and signal to background ratio (SBR) associated to each scintillator. The latter were subsequently
compared with those found in the literature for the Exradin W1, a single-point plastic scintillator
detector. Finally, various beam measurements were realized with the HYPERSCINT platform to evaluate
its ability to perform clinical photon beam dosimetry. Both systems were found to be comparable
in terms of linearity of the signal as a function of the intensity. Although the QE65Pro possesses
a higher spectral resolution, the detection efficency of the HYPERSCINT is up to 1000 time greater.
Dosimetric measurements shows that the latter also offers a better SNR and SBR, surpassing even
the SNR of the Exradin W1 single-point PSD. While the doses ranging from 1 cGy to 600 cGy were accurately
measured within 2.1% of the predicted dose using the HYPERSCINT platform coupled to the mPSD, the
Ocean optics spectrometer shows discrepencies up to 86% under 50cGy. Similarly, depth dose, Full-Width-Half-Max
region of the beam profile and output factors were all accurately measured within 2.3% of the predicted
dose using the HYPERSCINT platform and exhibit an average difference of 0.5%, 1.6% and 0.6%, respectively.

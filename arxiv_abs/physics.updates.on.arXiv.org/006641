The purpose of the presented research is estimation of the performance characteristics of the economic
Total-Body Jagiellonian-PET system (TB-J-PET) constructed from plastic scintillators. The
characteristics are estimated according to the NEMA NU-2-2018 standards utilizing the GATE package.
The simulated detector consists of 24 modules, each built out of 32 plastic scintillator strips
(each with cross section of 6 mm times 30 mm and length of 140 cm or 200 cm) arranged in two layers in regular
24-sided polygon circumscribing a circle with the diameter of 78.6 cm. For the TB-J-PET with an axial
field-of-view (AFOV) of 200 cm, a spatial resolutions of 3.7 mm (transversal) and 4.9 mm (axial)
are achieved. The NECR peak of 630 kcps is expected at 30 kBq/cc activity concentration and the sensitivity
at the center amounts to 38 cps/kBq. The SF is estimated to 36.2 %. The values of SF and spatial resolution
are comparable to those obtained for the state-of-the-art clinical PET scanners and the first total-body
tomographs: uExplorer and PennPET. With respect to the standard PET systems with AFOV in the range
from 16 cm to 26 cm, the TB-J-PET is characterized by an increase in NECR approximately by factor of
4 and by the increase of the whole-body sensitivity by factor of 12.6 to 38. The TOF resolution for
the TB-J-PET is expected to be at the level of CRT=240 ps (FWHM). For the TB-J-PET with an axial field-of-view
(AFOV) of 140 cm, an image quality of the reconstructed images of a NEMA IEC phantom was presented
with a contrast recovery coefficient (CRC) and a background variability parameters. The increase
of the whole-body sensitivity and NECR estimated for the TB-J-PET with respect to current commercial
PET systems makes the TB-J-PET a promising cost-effective solution for the broad clinical applications
of total-body PET scanners.

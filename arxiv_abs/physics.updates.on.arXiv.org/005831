We consider a two-component linearly-coupled system with the intrinsic cubic nonlinearity and
the harmonic-oscillator (HO) confining potential. The system models binary settings in BEC and
optics. In the symmetric system, with the HO trap acting in both components, we consider Josephson
oscillations (JO) initiated by an input in the form of the HO's ground state (GS) or dipole mode (DM),
placed in one component. With the increase of the strength of the self-focusing nonlinearity, spontaneous
symmetry breaking (SSB) between the components takes place in the dynamical JO state. Under still
stronger nonlinearity, the regular JO initiated by the GS input carry over into a chaotic dynamical
state. For the DM input, the chaotization happens at smaller powers than for the GS, which is followed
by SSB at a slightly stronger nonlinearity. In the system with the defocusing nonlinearity, SSB
does not take place, and dynamical chaos occurs in a small area of the parameter space. In the asymmetric
half-trapped system, with the HO potential applied to a single component, we first focus on the spectrum
of confined binary modes in the linearized system. The spectrum is found analytically in the limits
of weak and strong inter-component coupling, and numerically in the general case. Under the action
of the coupling, the existence region of the confined modes shrinks for GSs and expands for DMs. In
the full nonlinear system, the existence region for confined modes is identified in the numerical
form. They are constructed too by means of the Thomas-Fermi approximation, in the case of the defocusing
nonlinearity. Lastly, particular (non-generic) exact analytical solutions for confined modes,
including vortices, in one- and two-dimensional asymmetric linearized systems are found. They
represent bound states in the continuum.

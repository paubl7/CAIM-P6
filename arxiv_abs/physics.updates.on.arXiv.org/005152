Dynamical polydispersity in single-particle properties, for example a fluctuating particle
size, shape, charge density, etc., is intrinsic to responsive colloids (RCs), such as biomacromolecules
or microgels, but is typically not resolved in coarse-grained mesoscale simulations. Here, we
present Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations of suspensions of RCs modeling soft hydrogel colloids,
for which the size of the individual particles is an explicitly resolved (Gaussian) degree of freedom
and dynamically responds to the local interacting environment. We calculate the liquid structure,
emergent size distributions, long-time diffusion, and property (size) relaxation kinetics for
a wide range of densities and intrinsic property relaxation times in the canonical ensemble. Comparison
to interesting reference cases, such as conventional polydisperse suspensions with a frozen parent
distribution, or conventional monodisperse systems interacting with an effective pair potential
for one fixed size, shows a significant spread in the structure and dynamics. The differences, most
apparent in the high density regimes, are due to many-body correlations and the dynamical coupling
between property and translation in RC systems, not explicitly accounted for in the conventional
treatments. In particular, the translational diffusion in the RC systems is surprisingly close
to the free (single RC) diffusion, mainly due to a cancellation of crowding and size compression
effects. We show that an effective monodisperse pair potential can be constructed that describes
the many-body correlations reasonably well by convoluting the RC pair potential with the density-dependent
emergent size distributions and using a mean effective diffusion constant.

The recent development of electron sensitive and pixelated detectors has attracted the use of four-dimensional
scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM). Here, we present a precession electron
diffraction assisted 4D-STEM technique for automated orientation mapping using diffraction
spot patterns directly captured by an in-column scintillator based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
(CMOS) detector. We compare the results to a conventional approach, which utilizes a phosphor screen
filmed by an external CCD camera. The high dynamic range and signal to noise characteristics of the
detector largely improve the image quality of the diffraction patterns, especially the visibility
of diffraction spots at high scattering angles. Moreover, the afterimage formation during probe
scanning, which obscures orientation indexing in the conventional approach, is suppressed by
the fast read-out rate of the detector. The scintillator was found to be robust during the acquisition
of nanobeam diffraction pattern including the unblocked transmitted beam in a TEM operated at 200
kV. In the orientation maps reconstructed via the template matching process, the CMOS data yields
a significant reduction of false indexing and a higher reliability compared to the conventional
approach. This is because the orientation sensitive, weak and small diffraction spots at high scattering
angle are more significant. The angular resolution could also be improved in both accuracy and precision
by masking reflections close to the direct beam. The results show that fine details such as nano grains,
nano twins and sub-grain boundaries can be resolved with sub-degree angular resolution which is
comparable Kikuchi-diffraction based orientation mapping.

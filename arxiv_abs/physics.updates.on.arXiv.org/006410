Infrastructure systems, such as power, transportation, telecommunication, and water systems,
are composed of multiple components which are interconnected and interdependent to produce and
distribute essential goods and services. So, the robustness of infrastructure systems to resist
failures is critical for the durable performance of modern societies. Multilayer networks have
been introduced to model the complexity of such systems and percolation theory is the most common
approach to quantify the robustness of networked systems. This survey systematically reviews
literature published between 2010 and 2021, on applying percolation theory to assess the robustness
of infrastructure systems modelled as multilayer networks. We discussed all network properties
applied to build multilayer models of infrastructure systems. Among all properties, studying
the effect of interdependency strength and communities on the robustness of multilayer models
was the most common among while papers that considered directed links and feedback conditions in
interdependent connections were scarce. The identified network properties have almost similar
boosting and deteriorating effects on the robustness of multilayer models. The focus of the studies
was mostly on simplified arbitrary models rather than models built by real data. Thus, this review
suggests working on more comprehensive models which are based on real infrastructure systems in
future studies. In this case, models can contain different properties together to investigate
if some properties boost or weaken the effect of other properties. In addition, the effect size of
different properties on the robustness of infrastructure systems can be quantified and compared
in future studies to help to make better decisions for improving infrastructure systems.

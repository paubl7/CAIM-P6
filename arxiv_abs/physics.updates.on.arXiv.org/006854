Tracer particles immersed in suspensions of biological microswimmers such as E. coli or Chlamydomonas
display phenomena unseen in conventional equilibrium systems, including strongly enhanced diffusivity
relative to the Brownian value and non-Gaussian displacement statistics. In dilute, 3-dimensional
suspensions, these phenomena have typically been explained by the hydrodynamic advection of point
tracers by isolated microswimmers, while, at higher concentrations, correlations between pusher
microswimmers such as E. coli can increase the effective diffusivity even further. Anisotropic
tracers in active suspensions can be expected to exhibit even more complex behaviour than spherical
ones, due to the presence of a nontrivial translation-rotation coupling. Using large-scale lattice
Boltzmann simulations of model microswimmers described by extended force dipoles, we study the
motion of ellipsoidal point tracers immersed in 3-dimensional microswimmer suspensions. We find
that the rotational diffusivity of tracers is much less affected by swimmer-swimmer correlations
than the translational diffusivity. We furthermore study the anisotropic translational diffusion
in the particle frame and find that, in pusher suspensions, the diffusivity along the ellipsoid
major axis is higher than in the direction perpendicular to it, albeit with a smaller ratio than for
Brownian diffusion. Thus, we find that far field hydrodynamics cannot account for the anomalous
coupling between translation and rotation observed in experiments, as was recently proposed.
Finally, we study the probability distributions (PDFs) of translational and rotational displacements.
In accordance with experimental observations, for short observation times we observe strongly
non-Gaussian PDFs that collapse when rescaled with their variance, which we attribute to the ballistic
nature of tracer motion at short times.

Sound absorption at low frequencies still remains a challenge in both scientific research and engineering
practice. Natural porous materials are ineffective in this frequency range, as well as acoustic
resonators which present too narrow bandwidth of absorption, thus requiring alternative solutions
based on active absorption techniques. In the present work, we propose an active control framework
applied on a closed-box loudspeaker to enable the adjustment of the acoustic impedance at the loudspeaker
diaphragm. More specifically, based on the proportionality between the pressure inside the enclosure
and the axial displacement of the loudspeaker diaphragm at low frequencies, we demonstrate both
analytically and experimentally that a PID-like feedback control approach allows tuning independently
the compliance, the resistance and the moving mass of the closed-box loudspeaker to implement a
prescribed impedance of a single-degree-of-freedom resonator. By considering different control
combinations to tailor the resonator characteristics, a perfect absorption (with absorption
coefficient equal to 1) is achievable at the target resonance frequency, while enlarging the effective
absorption bandwidth. Moreover, the proposed feedback control strategy shows an excellent control
accuracy, especially compared to the feedforward-based control formerly reported in the literature.
The mismatches between the performance of experimental prototype and the model, likely to result
from the control time delay and the inaccuracy in estimating the loudspeaker parameters, can be
compensated directly by tuning the control parameters in the control platform. The active resonators
implemented through the reported control scheme can be used to build more complex acoustic devices/structures
to enable high-efficiency broadband sound absorption or other types of acoustic phenomena such
as wavefront shaping.

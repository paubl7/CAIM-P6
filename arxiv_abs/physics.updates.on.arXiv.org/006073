Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) enables the assessment of intracellular,
extracellular and free water signals from multi-shell diffusion MRI data. It is an insightful approach
to characterize brain tissue microstructure. Single-shell reconstruction for NODDI parameters
has been discouraged in previous studies caused by failure when fitting, especially for the neurite
density index (NDI). Here, we investigated the possibility of creating robust NODDI parameter
maps with single-shell data, using the isotropic volume fraction (fISO) as prior. Prior estimation
was made independent of the NODDI model constraint using a dictionary learning approach. First,
we used a stochastic sparse dictionary-based network (DictNet) in predicting fISO which is trained
with data obtained from in vivo and simulated diffusion MRI data. In single-shell cases, the mean
diffusivity (MD) and raw T2 signal with no diffusion weighting (S0) was incorporated in the dictionary
for the fISO estimation. Then, the NODDI framework was used with the known fISO to estimate the NDI
and orientation dispersion index (ODI). The fISO estimated by our model was compared with other
fISO estimators in the simulation. Further, using both synthetic data simulation and human data
collected on a 3T scanner, we compared the performance of our dictionary-based learning prior NODDI
(DLpN) with the original NODDI for both single-shell and multi-shell data. Our results suggest
that DLpN derived NDI and ODI parameters for single-shell protocols are comparable with original
multi-shell NODDI, and protocol with b=2000 s/mm2 performs the best (error ~5% in white and grey
matter). This may allow NODDI evaluation of studies on single-shell data by multi-shell scanning
of two subjects for DictNet fISO training.

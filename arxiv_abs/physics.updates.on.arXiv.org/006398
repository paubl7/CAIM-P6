Binary decision-making process is ubiquitous in social life and is of vital significance in many
real-world issues, ranging from public health to political campaigns. While continuous opinion
evolution independent of discrete choice behavior has been extensively studied, few works unveil
how the group binary decision-making result is determined by the coupled dynamics of these two processes.
To this end, we propose an agent-based model to study the collective behaviors of individual binary
decision-making process through competitive opinion dynamics on social networks. Three key factors
are considered: bounded confidence that describes the cognitive scope of the population, stubbornness
level that characterizes the opinion updating speed, and the opinion strength that represents
the asymmetry power or attractiveness of the two choices. We find that bounded confidence plays
an important role in determining competing evolution results. As bounded confidence grows, population
opinions experience polarization to consensus, leading to the emergence of phase transition from
co-existence to winner-takes-all state under binary decisions. Of particular interest, we show
how the combined effects of bounded confidence and asymmetry opinion strength may reverse the initial
supportive advantage in competitive dynamics. Notably, our model qualitatively reproduces the
important dynamical pattern during a brutal competition, namely, cascading collapse, as observed
by real data. Finally and intriguingly, we find that individual cognitive heterogeneity can bring
about randomness and unpredictability in binary decision-making process, leading to the emergence
of indeterministic oscillation. Our results reveal how the diverse behavioral patterns of binary
decision-making can be interpreted by the complicated interactions of the proposed elements,
which provides important insights toward competitive dynamics

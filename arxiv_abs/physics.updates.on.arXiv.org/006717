In the near future there will be the request for very large liquid Xenon (LXe) detectors for Dark Matter
(DM) searches in the 50-ton range. To avoid an impractically long, single drift space of a dual-phase
detector, it seems beneficial to use the single-phase technique. Since electrons then can drift
in any direction, we can segment the homogeneous medium and thus avoid an excessive maximum drift
path of order 4 m. The shorter detector length has several benefits, e.g. requiring a lower cathode
voltage for the same drift field. We can easily split the TPC into two regions with the cathode in the
center and two anodes at the top and bottom. One also can use multiple TPCs stacked on top of each other
in the same liquid volume to reduce the maximum drift length even further. A further division of the
drift space by installing an additional anode in the center would require S2 photons to traverse
the liquid for several times the Rayleigh scattering length in LXe, which is only 30 - 40 cm. This seems
to be excessive for good x - y localization. We therefore suggest a geometry of two independent TPCs
with two drift spaces each. Despite earlier publications concerns persisted about the effect of
shadowing. A detailed FEM model of the anode regions shows that with an aligned wire arrangement
the drifting electrons impinge sideways on the anode in a narrow angular range of width 15$^{\circ}$
- 20$^{\circ}$. Most S2 photons are emitted in full view of the close-by PMT array. About 37% of the
S2 photons are shadowed by the anode wire out of which 30\% will be reflected back again on the gold
plating of the wires. Thus we can observe 74% of the total S2 light. Compared to a dual-phase detector,
however, we do not suffer from the extraction efficiency, sometimes reported as low as 50%.

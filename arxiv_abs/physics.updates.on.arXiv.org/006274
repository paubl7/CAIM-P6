Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems use the non-destructive testing principle for damage
identification. As part of SHM, the propagation of ultrasonic guided waves (UGWs) is tracked and
analyzed for the changes in the associated wave pattern. These changes help identify the location
of a structural damage, if any. We advance existing research by accounting for uncertainty in the
material and geometric properties of a structure. The physics model used in this study comprises
of a monolithically coupled system of acoustic and elastic wave equations, known as the wave propagation
in fluid-solid and their interface (WpFSI) problem. As the UGWs propagate in the solid, fluid, and
their interface, the wave signal displacement measurements are contrasted against the benchmark
pattern. For the numerical solution, we develop an efficient algorithm that successfully addresses
the inherent complexity of solving the multiphysics problem under uncertainty. We present a procedure
that uses Gaussian process regression and convolutional neural network for predicting the UGW
propagation in a solid-fluid and their interface under uncertainty. First, a set of training images
for different realizations of the uncertain parameters of the inclusion inside the structure is
generated using a monolithically-coupled system of acoustic and elastic wave equations. Next,
Gaussian processes trained with these images are used for predicting the propagated wave with convolutional
neural networks for further enhancement to produce high-quality images of the wave patterns for
new realizations of the uncertainty. The results indicate that the proposed approach provides
an accurate prediction for the WpFSI problem in the presence of uncertainty.

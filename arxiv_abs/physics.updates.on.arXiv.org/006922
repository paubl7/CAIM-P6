Concussion and repeated exposure to mild traumatic brain injury are risks for athletes in many sports.
While direct head impacts are analyzed to improve the detection and awareness of head acceleration
events so that an athlete's brain health can be appropriately monitored and treated. However, head
accelerations can also be induced by impacts with little or no head involvement. In this work we evaluated
if impacts that do not involve direct head contact, such as being pushed in the torso, can be sufficient
in collegiate American football to induce head accelerations comparable to direct head impacts.
Datasets of impacts with and without direct head contact were collected and compared. These datasets
were gathered using a state-of-the-art impact detection algorithm embedded in an instrumented
mouthguard to record head kinematics. Video analysis was used to differentiate between impact
types. In total, 15 impacts of each type were used in comparison, with clear video screenshots available
to distinguish each impact type. Analysis of the kinematics showed that the impacts without direct
head contact achieved similar levels of linear and angular accelerations during impact compared
to those from direct head impacts. Finite element analyses using the median and peak kinematic signals
were used to calculate maximum principal strain of the brain. Statistical analysis revealed that
no significant difference was found between the two datasets based on a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value
threshold of 0.017 , with the exception of peak linear acceleration. Impacts without direct head
contact showed higher mean values of peak linear acceleration values of 17.6 g compared to the direct-head
impact mean value of 6.1g. These results indicated that impacts other than direct head impacts could
still produce meaningful kinematic loads in the head and as such should be included in athlete health
monitoring.

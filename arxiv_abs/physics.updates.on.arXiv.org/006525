The objective of this research is to explore the temporal importance of community-scale human activity
features for rapid assessment of flood impacts. Ultimate flood impact data, such as flood inundation
maps and insurance claims, becomes available only weeks and months after the floods have receded.
Crisis response managers, however, need near-real-time data to prioritize emergency response.
This time lag creates a need for rapid flood impact assessment. Some recent studies have shown promising
results for using human activity fluctuations as indicators of flood impacts. Existing studies,
however, used mainly a single community-scale activity feature for the estimation of flood impacts
and have not investigated their temporal importance for indicating flood impacts. Hence, in this
study, we examined the importance of heterogeneous human activity features in different flood
event stages. Using four community-scale big data categories we derived ten features related to
the variations in human activity and evaluated their temporal importance for rapid assessment
of flood impacts. Using multiple random forest models, we examined the temporal importance of each
feature in indicating the extent of flood impacts in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris
County, Texas. Our findings reveal that 1) fluctuations in human activity index and percentage
of congested roads are the most important indicators for rapid flood impact assessment during response
and recovery stages; 2) variations in credit card transactions assumed a middle ranking; and 3)
patterns of geolocated social media posts (Twitter) were of low importance across flood stages.
The results of this research could rapidly forge a multi-tool enabling crisis managers to identify
hotspots with severe flood impacts at various stages then to plan and prioritize effective response
strategies.

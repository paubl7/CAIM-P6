From paints to food products, solvent evaporation is ubiquitous and critically impacts product
rheological properties. It affects Newtonian fluids by concentrating any non-volatile components
and viscoelastic materials, which hardens up. In both of these cases, solvent evaporation leads
to a change in the sample volume, which makes any rheological measurements particularly challenging
with traditional shear geometries. Here we show that the rheological properties of a sample experiencing
`slow' evaporation can be monitored in a time-resolved fashion by using a zero normal-force controlled
protocol in a parallel-plate geometry. Solvent evaporation from the sample leads to a decrease
of the normal force, which is compensated at all times by a decrease of the gap height between the plates.
As a result, the sample maintains a constant contact area with the plates despite the significant
decrease of its volume. We validate the method under both oscillatory and continuous shear by accurately
monitoring the viscosity of water-glycerol mixtures experiencing evaporation and a relative
volume decrease as large as 70%. Moreover, we apply this protocol to dehydrating suspensions. Specifically,
we monitor a dispersion of charged silica nanoparticles undergoing a glass transition induced
by evaporation. While the decrease in gap height provides a direct estimate of the increasing particle
volume fraction, oscillatory and continuous shear measurements allow us to monitor the suspension's
evolving viscoelastic properties in real-time. Overall, our study shows that a zero normal-force
protocol provides a simple approach to bulk and time-resolved rheological characterization for
systems experiencing slow volume variations.

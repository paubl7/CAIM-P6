This work presents a robust and efficient sharp interface immersed boundary (IBM) framework, which
is applicable for all-speed flow regimes and is capable of handling arbitrarily complex bodies
(stationary or moving). The work deploys an in-house, parallel, multi-block structured finite
volume flow solver, which employs a 3D unsteady Favre averaged Navier Stokes equations in a generalized
curvilinear coordinate system; while we employ a combination of HCIB (Hybrid Cartesian Immersed
boundary) method and GC(Ghost-cell) for solution reconstruction near immersed boundary interface.
A significant difficulty for these sharp interface approaches is of handling sharp features/edges
of complex geometries. In this study, we observe that apart from the need for robust node classification
strategy and higher order boundary formulations, the direction in which the reconstruction procedures
are performed plays an important role in handling sharp edges. Taking this into account we present
a versatile interface tracking procedure based on ray tracing algorithm and a novel three step solution
reconstruction procedure that computes pseudo-normals in the regions where the normal is not well-defined
and reconstructs the flow field along those directions. We demonstrate that this procedure enables
solver to efficiently handle and accurately represent sharp-edged regions. A fifth-order weighted
essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme is used for capturing shock-induced discontinuities
and complex fluid-solid interactions with high resolution. The developed IBM framework is applied
to a wide range of flow phenomena encompassing all-speed regimes (M=0.001 to M = 2.0). A total of seven
benchmark cases (three stationary and four moving bodies) are presented involving various geometries
(cylinder, airfoil, wedge) and the predictions are found to be in excellent agreement with the published
results.

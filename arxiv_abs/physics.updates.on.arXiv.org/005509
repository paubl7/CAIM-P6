Cooperation is vital for the survival of a swarm$^1$. Large scale cooperation allows murmuring
starlings to outmaneuver preying falcons$^2$, shoaling sardines to outsmart sea lions$^3$, and
homo sapiens to outlive their Pleistocene peers$^4$. On the micron-scale, bacterial colonies
show excellent resilience thanks to the individuals' ability to cooperate even when densely packed,
mitigating their internal flow pattern to mix nutrients, fence the immune system, and resist antibiotics$^{5-14}$.
Production of an artificial swarm on the micro-scale faces a serious challenge $\frac{\;\;}{\;\;}$
while an individual bacterium has an evolutionary-forged internal machinery to produce propulsion,
until now, artificial micro-swimmers relied on the precise chemical composition of their environment
to directly fuel their drive$^{14-23}$. When crowded, artificial micro-swimmers compete locally
for a finite fuel supply, quenching each other's activity at their greatest propensity for cooperation.
Here we introduce an artificial micro-swimmer that consumes no chemical fuel and is driven solely
by light. We couple a light absorbing particle to a fluid droplet, forming a colloidal chimera that
transforms light energy into propulsive thermo-capillary action. The swimmers' internal drive
allows them to operate and remain active for a long duration (days) and their effective repulsive
interaction allows for a high density fluid phase. We find that above a critical concentration,
swimmers form a long lived crowded state that displays internal dynamics. When passive particles
are introduced, the dense swimmer phase can re-arrange and spontaneously corral the passive particles.
We derive a geometrical, depletion-like condition for corralling by identifying the role the passive
particles play in controlling the effective concentration of the micro-swimmers.

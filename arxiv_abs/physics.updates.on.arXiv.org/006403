Large-scale ecotoxicological studies have technical and ethical limitations, both related to
the need to expose individuals to potentially harmful compounds. Computational modeling is a complementary
useful and predictive tool that overcomes these limitations. Considering the increasing interest
in the effects of pesticides on behavioral traits, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects
of chlorpyrifos (CPF) on intra- and inter-specific interactions of anuran tadpoles, complementing
traditional ecotoxicological tools with a theoretical analysis verified by computational simulations.
Experiments were developed under two consecutive phases: a first phase of exposure, and a second
phase of interactions. The second phase consisted of evaluating the effects of CPF on intra- and
inter-specific interactions of exposed C. ornata (Co) tadpoles acting as predators and unexposed
Rhinella fernandezae (Rf) tadpoles acting as prey, under different predator-prey proportions.
Also, intraspecific interactions of three Co tadpoles under different conditions of exposure
were evaluated. During the exposure phase, chlorpyrifos induced significant mortality from 48h,
irregular swimming, tail flexure, and the presence of subcutaneous air. Also, it induced effects
on the sounds emitted after 96h of exposure, registering less number of pulses and higher dominant
frequencies, and altered intra- and inter-specific interactions. During the interaction phase,
the larvae continued to show sound effects, however, the antipredator mechanism continued to be
operating and efficient. Finally, it was possible to model the behavior of the larvae under the effects
of chlorpyrifos. We conclude that experimental data and computational modeling matched within
errors. Therefore, computational simulation is a valuable ecotoxicological tool that provides
new information and allows predicting natural processes.

If equilibrium is a frame-independent condition, the gravitational force should be transformed
in exactly the same way as the Lorentz-force does in different inertial frames. In order for this
to happen, gravity should be described by a gravitomagnetic theory in which the equations have the
same mathematical form as those of the electromagnetic theory, with the gravitational mass as a
Lorentz invariant. The Faraday's law of electromagnetism, will therefore become a fundamental
law of the gravitomagnetism too, and allow us to prove the relativity of all kinds of translatory
motion, by accepting the principles of covariance for all reference frames in relative translatory
motion, and restating the equivalence principle for both the gravitomagnetism and electromagnetism.
Following the principles, we prove that, 1. The external inertial forces, perceived by an accelerating
body, are real gravitational and electric forces, due to induction effects from the entire Universe.
2. The internal inertial force, on an accelerating body, depends on the body's structure, but in
the free fall is canceled, because of the equivalence principle. Thus, all bodies fall with the same
acceleration. 3. The inertial rest mass of a body depends on the gravitational and electric scalar
potentials, from the entire Universe, and can take positive or negative value. 4. The dependence
of the inertial mass of a body, on the surrounding bodies, seems to be very important for the explanation
of dark matter, dark energy. 5. The gravitational and electric forces curve the spacetime perceived
by a body and every freely moving body follows geodesic of the spacetime that perceives. Finally
we derive a general spacetime metric which includes the Schwarzschild metric. So, the new theory
is in agreement with the past experiments

A hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian solver RYrhoCentralFoam is developed based on OpenFOAM to simulate
detonative combustion in two-phase gas-liquid mixtures. For Eulerian gas phase, RYrhoCentralFoam
enjoys second order of accuracy in time and space discretizations and is based on finite volume method
on polyhedral cells. The following developments are made based on the standard compressible flow
solver rhoCentralFoam in OpenFOAM: (1) multi-component species transport, (2) detailed fuel
chemistry for gas phase combustion, and (3) Lagrangian solver for gas-droplet two-phase flows
and sub-models for liquid droplets. To extensively verify and validate the developments and implementations
of the solver and models, a series of benchmark cases are studied, including non-reacting multi-component
gaseous flows, purely gaseous detonations, and two-phase gas-droplet mixtures. The results show
that the RYrhoCentralFoam solver can accurately predict the flow discontinuities (e.g. shock
wave and expansion wave), molecular diffusion, auto-ignition and shock-induced ignition. Also,
the RYrhoCentralFoam solver can accurately simulate gaseous detonation propagation for different
fuels (e.g. hydrogen and methane), about propagation speed, detonation frontal structures and
cell size. Sub-models related to the droplet phase are verified and/or validated against analytical
and experimental data. It is also found that the RYrhoCentralFoam solver is able to capture the main
quantities and features of the gas-droplet two-phase detonations, including detonation propagation
speed, interphase interactions and detonation frontal structures. As our future work, RYrhoCentralFoam
solver can also be extended for simulating two-phase detonations in dense droplet sprays.

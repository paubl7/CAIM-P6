Linear stability analysis is performed using a combination of two-dimensional Direct Simulation
Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for the computation of the basic state and solution of the pertinent eigenvalue
problem, as applied to the canonical boundary layer on a semi-infinite flat plate. Three different
gases are monitored, namely nitrogen, argon and air, the latter as a mixture of 79\% Nitrogen and
21\% Oxygen at a range of free-stream Mach numbers corresponding to flight at an altitude of 55km.
A neural network has been utilised to predict and smooth the raw DSMC data; the steady laminar profiles
obtained are in very good agreement with those computed by (self-similar) boundary layer theory,
under isothermal or adiabatic wall conditions, subject to the appropriate slip corrections computed
in the DSMC method. The leading eigenmode results pertaining to the unsmoothed DSMC profiles are
compared against those of the classic boundary layer theory. Small quantitative, but no significant
qualitative differences between the results of the two classes of steady base flows have been found
at all parameters examined. The frequencies of the leading eigenmodes at all conditions examined
are practically identical, while perturbations corresponding to the DSMC profiles are found to
be systematically more damped than their counterparts arising in the boundary layer at the conditions
examined, when the correct velocity slip and temperature jump boundary conditions are imposed
in the base flow profiles; by contrast, when the classic no-slip boundary conditions are used, less
damped/more unstable profiles are obtained, which would lead the flow to earlier transition. On
the other hand, the DSMC profiles smoothed by the neural network are marginally more stable than
their unsmoothed counterparts.

The starting point to understanding cluster properties is the putative global minimum and all the
nearby local energy minima; however, locating them is computationally expensive and challenging
due to a combinatorial explosion problem. The relative populations and spectroscopic properties
of a molecule that are a function of temperature can be approximately computed by employing statistical
thermodynamics. Here, we investigate temperature-entropy-driven isomers distribution on Be$_6$B$_{11}^{-}$
fluxional cluster and the effect of temperature on their infrared spectroscopy and relative populations.
We identify the vibration modes possessed by the cluster that significantly contribute to the zero-point
energy. A couple of steps are considered for computing the temperature-dependent relative population:
First, using a genetic algorithm coupled to density functional theory, we performed an extensive
and systematic exploration of the potential/free energy surface of Be$_6$B$_{11}^{-}$ cluster
to locate the putative global minimum and elucidate the low-energy structures. Second, the relative
populations' temperature effects are determined by considering the thermodynamic properties
and Boltzmann factors. The temperature-dependent relative populations show that the entropies
and temperature are essential for determining the global minimum. We compute the temperature-dependent
total infrared spectra employing the Boltzmann factor weighted sums of each isomer's infrared
spectrum and find that at finite temperature, the total infrared spectrum is composed of an admixture
of infrared spectra that corresponds to the spectrum of the lowest energy structure and its isomers
located at higher energies. The methodology and results describe the thermal effects in the relative
population and the infrared spectra.

Our objective will be to integrate ML into Fermilab accelerator operations and furthermore provide
an accessible framework which can also be used by a broad range of other accelerator systems with
dynamic tuning needs. We will develop of real-time accelerator control using embedded ML on-chip
hardware and fast communication between distributed systems in this proposal. We will demonstrate
this technology for the Mu2e experiment by increasing the overall duty factor and uptime of the experiment
through two synergistic projects. First, we will use deep reinforcement learning techniques to
improve the performance of the regulation loop through guided optimization to provide stable proton
beams extracted from the Delivery Ring to the Mu2e experiment. This requires the development of
a digital twin of the system to model the accelerator and develop real-time ML algorithms. Second,
we will use de-blending techniques to disentangle and classify overlapping beam losses in the Main
Injector and Recycler Ring to reduce overall beam downtime in each machine. This ML model will be
deployed within a semi-autonomous operational mode. Both applications require processing at
the millisecond scale and will share similar ML-in-hardware techniques and beam instrumentation
readout technology. A collaboration between Fermilab and Northwestern University will pull together
the talents and resources of accelerator physicists, beam instrumentation engineers, embedded
system architects, FPGA board design experts, and ML experts to solve complex real-time accelerator
controls challenges which will enhance the physics program. More broadly, the framework developed
for Accelerator Real-time Edge AI Distributed Systems (READS) can be applied to future projects
as the accelerator complex is upgraded for the PIP-II and DUNE era.

The field of two-dimensional materials has been developing at an impressive pace, with atomically
thin crystals of an increasing number of different compounds that have become available, together
with techniques enabling their assembly into functional heterostructures. The strategy to detect
these atomically thin crystals has however remained unchanged since the discovery of graphene.
Such an absence of evolution is starting to pose problems because for many of the 2D materials of current
interest the optical contrast provided by the commonly used detection procedure is insufficient
to identify the presence of individual monolayers or to determine unambiguously the thickness
of atomically thin multilayers. Here we explore an alternative detection strategy, in which the
enhancement of optical contrast originates from the use of optically inhomogeneous substrates,
leading to diffusively reflected light. Owing to its peculiar polarization properties and to its
angular distribution, diffusively reflected light allows a strong contrast enhancement to be
achieved through the implementation of suitable illumination-detection schemes. We validate
this conclusion by carrying out a detailed quantitative analysis of optical contrast, which fully
reproduces our experimental observations on over 60 WSe$_2$ mono-, bi-, and trilayers. We further
validate the proposed strategy by extending our analysis to atomically thin phosphorene, InSe,
and graphene crystals. Our conclusion is that the use of diffusively reflected light to detect and
identify atomically thin layers is an interesting alternative to the common detection scheme based
on Fabry-Perot interference, because it enables atomically thin layers to be detected on substrates
others than the commonly used Si/SiO$_2$, and it may offer higher sensitivity depending on the specific
2D material considered.

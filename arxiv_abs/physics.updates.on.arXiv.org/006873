The third (or organismic) view of space states that space is neither lifeless nor neutral, but a living
structure capable of being more living or less living, thus different fundamentally from the first
two mechanistic views of space: Newtonian absolute space and Leibnizian relational space. The
living structure is defined as a physical and mathematical structure or simply characterized by
the recurring notion (or inherent hierarchy) of far more small substructures than large ones. This
paper seeks to lay out a new geography as a science of the Earth's surface founded on the third view
of space. The new geography aims not only to better understand geographic forms and processes but
also - maybe more importantly - to make geographic space or the Earth's surface to be living or more
living. After introducing two fundamental laws of geography: Tobler's law on spatial dependence
(or homogeneity) and scaling law on spatial heterogeneity, we argue that these two laws are fundamental
laws of living structure that favor statistics over exactitude, because the former (or statistics)
tends to make a structure more living than the latter (or exactitute). We present the concept of living
structure through some working examples and make it clear how a living structure differs from a non-living
structure, under the organismic worldview that was first conceived by the British philosopher
Alfred Whitehead (1861-1947). In order to make a structure or space living or more living, we introduce
two design principles - differentiation and adaptation - using two paintings and two city plans.
The new geography is a science of living structure, dealing with a wide range of scales, from the smallest
scale of ornaments on walls to the scale of the entire Earth's surface. Keywords: Scaling law, Tobler's
law, differentiation, adaptation, head/tail breaks, natural streets, the third view of space

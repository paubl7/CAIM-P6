Steady plasma flows have been studied almost exclusively in systems with continuous symmetry or
in open domains. In the absence of continuous symmetry, the lack of a conserved quantity makes the
study of flows intrinsically challenging. In a toroidal domain, the requirement of double-periodicity
for physical quantities adds to the complications. In particular, the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
model of plasma steady-state with the flow in a non-symmetric toroidal domain allows the development
of singularities when the rotational transform of the magnetic field is rational, much like the
equilibrium MHD model. In this work, we show that steady flows can still be maintained provided the
rotational transform is close to rational and the magnetic shear is weak. We extend the techniques
developed in carrying out perturbation methods to all orders for static MHD equilibrium by Weitzner
(Physics of Plasmas 21, 022515 (2014)) to MHD equilibrium with flows. We construct perturbative
MHD equilibrium in a doubly-periodic domain with nearly parallel flows by systematically eliminating
magnetic resonances order by order. We then utilize an additional symmetry of the flow problem,
first discussed by E. Hameiri in (J. Math. Phys. \textbf{22}, 2080 (1981) Sec. III), to obtain a generalized
Grad-Shafranov equation for a class of non-symmetric three-dimensional MHD equilibrium with
flows both parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. For this class of flows, we are able
to obtain non-symmetric generalizations of integrals of motion, such as Bernoulli's function
and angular momentum. Finally, we obtain the generalized Hamada conditions, which are consistency
conditions necessary to suppress singular currents in such a system when the magnetic field lines
are closed. We do not attempt to address the question of neoclassical damping of flows.

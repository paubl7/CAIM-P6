Radio astronomy and Space Infrastructures in the Azores have a great scientific and industrial
interest because they benefit from a unique geographical location in the middle of the North Atlantic
allowing a vast improvement in the sky coverage. This fact obviously has a very high added value for:
i) the establishment of space tracking and communications networks for the emergent global small
satellite fleets ii) it is invaluable to connect the radio astronomy infrastructure networks in
Africa, Europe and America continents using Very Large Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) techniques,
iii) it allows excellent potential for monitoring space debris and Near Earth Objects (NEOs). There
is in S. Miguel island a 32-metre SATCOM antenna that could be integrated in advanced VLBI networks
and be capable of additional Deep Space Network ground support. This paper explores the space science
opportunities offered by the upgrade of the S. Miguel 32-metre SATCOM antenna into a world-class
infrastructure for radio astronomy and space exploration: it would enable a Deep Space Network
mode and would constitute a key space facility for data production, promoting local digital infrastructure
investments and the testing of cutting-edge information technologies. Its Atlantic location
also enables improvements in angular resolution, provides many baseline in East-West and North-South
directions connecting the emergent VLBI stations in America to Europe and Africa VLBI arrays therefore
contributing for greater array imaging capabilities especially for sources or well studied fields
close to or below the celestial equator, where ESO facilities, ALMA, SKA and its precursors do or
will operate and observe in the coming decades.

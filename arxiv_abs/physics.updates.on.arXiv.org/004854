Time-history deformation analyses of upstream-raised tailings dams use seismic records as input
data. Such records must be representative of the in-situ seismicity in terms of a wide range of intensity
measures including PGA, Arias intensity, cumulative absolute velocity, source-to-site distance,
duration, and others. No single IM is a sufficient descriptor of seismic demand because different
records, all of them compliant with any IM, can produce a very wide range of results from negligible
damage to global failure. The use of brute-force, where hundreds of seismic records compliant with
a set of IMs is employed, has proven to be a reasonable workaround of this limitation, at least able
to produce a probabilistic density function of demand indicators like crest settlement of the dam
or slope deformation. This procedure, however, requires a large number of numerical models to be
run, and is therefore time-consuming. Brute-force analyses can be optimized if an a-priori simple
tool is used to predict which seismic records would yield a given demand, thus obtaining an estimate
of the PDF of any demand indicator with many less runs. In this study, a new semi-analytical procedure
for evaluating the seismic demand imposed by a given seismic record on a tailings dam is proposed.
The procedure employs the spectral properties of the record filtered by those of the dam. Applications
to dams under strong earthquakes are presented and validated using numerical and analytical approaches.
The proposed procedure is able to produce an a-priori estimate of the damage potential of a given
seismic record, thus reducing the number of runs required to produce a realistic deformation analysis
of tailings dams subjected to earthquakes and a robust estimate of the PDF of any given indicator
of the seismic demand of the dam.

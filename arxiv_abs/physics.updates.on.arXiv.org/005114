Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of collisionless jets of electrons and positrons in an ambient
electron-proton plasma have revealed an acceleration of positrons at the expense of electron kinetic
energy. The dominant instability within the jet was a filamentation instability between electrons,
protons and positrons. In this work we show that a filamentation instability, between an initially
unmagnetized ambient electron-proton plasma at rest and a beam of pair plasma that moves through
it at a non-relativistic speed, indeed results in preferential positron acceleration. Filaments
form that are filled predominantly with particles with the same direction of their electric current
vector. Positron filaments are separated by electromagnetic fields from beam electron filaments.
Some particles can cross the field boundary and enter the filament of the other species. Positron
filaments can neutralize their net charge by collecting the electrons of the ambient plasma while
protons cannot easily follow the beam electron filaments. Positron filaments can thus be compressed
to a higher density and temperature than the beam electron filaments. Filament mergers, which take
place after the exponential growth phase of the instability has ended, lead to an expansion of the
beam electron filaments, which amplifies the magnetic field they generate and induces an electric
field in this filament. Beam electrons lose a substantial fraction of their kinetic energy to the
electric field. Some positrons in the beam electron filament are accelerated by the induced electric
field to almost twice their initial speed. The simulations show that a weaker electric field is induced
in the positron filament and particles in this filament hardly change their speed.

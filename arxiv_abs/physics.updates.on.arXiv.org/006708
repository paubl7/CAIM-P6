The interaction of swift, free-space electrons with confined optical near fields has recently
sparked much interest. It enables a new type of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy,
mapping local optical near fields around nanoparticles with exquisite spatial and spectral resolution
and lies at the heart of quantum state manipulation and attosecond pulse shaping of free electrons.
The corresponding interaction of optical near fields with slow electrons has achieved much less
attention, even though the lower electron velocity may enhance electron-near-field coupling
for small nanoparticles. A first-principle theoretical study of such interactions has been reported
very recently [N. Talebi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 080401 (2020)]. Building up on this work, we investigate,
both analytically and numerically, the inelastic scattering of slow electrons by near fields of
small nanostructures. For weak fields, this results in distinct angular diffraction patterns
that represent, to first order, the Fourier transform of the transverse variation of the scalar
near-field potential along the direction perpendicular to the electron propagation. For stronger
fields, scattering by the near-field component along the electron trajectory results in a break-up
of the energy spectrum into multiple photon orders. Their angular diffraction patterns are given
by integer powers of the Fourier transform of the transverse potential variation and are shifting
in phase with photon order. Our analytical model offers an efficient approach for studying the effects
of electron kinetic energy, near field shape and strength on the diffraction and thus may facilitate
the experimental observation of these phenomena by, e.g., ultrafast low-energy point-projection
microscopy or related techniques. This could provide simultaneous access to different vectorial
components of the optical near fields of small nanoparticles.

Atmosphere and ocean are coupled via air--sea interactions. The atmospheric conditions fuel the
ocean circulation and its variability, but the extent to which ocean processes can affect the atmosphere
at decadal time scales remains unclear. In particular, such low-frequency variability is difficult
to extract from the short observational record, meaning that climate models are the primary tools
deployed to resolve this question. Here, we assess how the ocean's intrinsic variability leads
to patterns of upper-ocean heat content that vary at decadal time scales. These patterns have the
potential to feed back on the atmosphere and thereby affect climate modes of variability, such as
El Ni\~no or the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. We use the output from a global ocean--sea ice
circulation model at three different horizontal resolutions, each driven by the same atmospheric
reanalysis. To disentangle the variability of the ocean's direct response to atmospheric forcing
from the variability due to intrinsic ocean dynamics, we compare model runs driven with inter-annually
varying forcing (1958-2019) and model runs driven with repeat-year forcing. Models with coarse
resolution that rely on eddy parameterizations, show (i) significantly reduced variance of the
upper-ocean heat content at decadal time scales and (ii) differences in the spatial patterns of
low-frequency variability compared with higher resolution simulations. Climate projections
are typically done with general circulation models with coarse-resolution ocean components.
Therefore, these biases affect our ability to predict decadal climate modes of variability and,
in turn, hinder climate projections. Our results suggest that for improving climate projections,
the community should move towards coupled climate models with higher oceanic resolution.

Compressible vortex rings, usually formed at the open end of a shock tube, often show interesting
phenomena during their formation, evolution, and propagation depending on the shock Mach number
(Ms) and exit flow conditions. The Mach number of the translating compressible vortex rings (Mv)
investigated so far in the literature is subsonic as, the shock tube pressure ratio (PR) considered
is relatively low. In this numerical study we focus on low to high vortex ring Mach numbers (0.31 <
Mv < 1.08) cases with a particular focus on very high Mv cases that are not been reported in experiments
as, it is difficult to obtain in laboratory. Using hydrogen as a driver section gas inside the shock
tube, a supersonic compressible vortex ring (Mv > 1) is obtained for first time. It is established
that the SST k-{\omega} based DES turbulent model replicates the experimental observation better
than the previously published results at different stages of development of the vortex ring. DES,
which is an inbuilt hybrid of LES and RANS approaches is evoked that can automatically switch to the
sub-grid scale (SGS) model in the LES regions (i.e. with different scale vortical structures) and
to a RANS model in the rest of the region (i.e. where the grid spacing is greater than the turbulent
length scale). The DES model can predict characteristics of the shear layer vortices as well as counter-rotating
vortex rings (CRVRs) as reported in the experimental measurements. Formation of multiple triple
points and the corresponding slip-stream shear layers and thus multiple CRVRs behind the primary
vortex ring at different radial locations, in addition to the usual CRVRs, appears to be a unique
characteristic for high Mach number vortex rings. For high PR, H2, case during formation stage,
a vortex layer of reverse circulation (that of primary vortex ring) is formed (contd...)

We numerically investigate the spatial and temporal statistical properties of a dilute polymer
solution in elastic turbulence regime, i.e., in the chaotic flow state occurring at vanishing Reynolds
and high Weissenberg numbers. We aim at elucidating the relations between measurements of flow
properties performed in the spatial domain with the ones taken in the temporal domain, which is a
key point for the interpretation of experimental results on elastic turbulence. Indeed, the available
experimental techniques typically allow access to the velocity field at best in a few specific positions
and at various times so that one can retrieve the spatial flow statistics only through Taylor's hypothesis.
To this end, we carry out extensive direct numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Kolmogorov
flow of an Oldroyd-B viscoelastic fluid. Static point-like numerical probes are placed at different
locations in the flow, particularly at the extrema of mean flow amplitude. The results in the fully
developed elastic turbulence regime reveal large velocity fluctuations, as compared to the mean
flow, leading to a partial breakdown of Taylor's frozen-field hypothesis. While second-order
statistics, probed by spectra and structure functions, display consistent scaling behaviors
in the spatial and temporal domains, the third-order statistics highlight robust differences.
In particular, the temporal analysis fails to capture the skewness of streamwise longitudinal
velocity increments. Finally, we assess both the degree of statistical inhomogeneity and isotropy
of the flow turbulent fluctuations as a function of scale. While the system is only weakly non-homogenous
in the cross-stream direction, it is found to be highly anisotropic at all scales.

During the last years, atmospheric pressure plasmas have re-established themselves as a research
focus. Radio-frequency driven atmospheric pressure plasma jets (here at the explicit example
of the COST-Jet) are commonly used plasma sources for these studies. A characteristic feature of
these atmospheric pressure plasma sources is the ratio between the Debye length $\lambda_D$ (here
about $10^1$ to $10^2\,$mm) and the length of the discharge gap $L_\mathrm{gap}$ (about 1 mm). Compared
to low-pressure applications, this ratio is rather high. Atmospheric pressure plasmas consequently
do not necessarily form a quasi-neutral bulk region. This work discovered such a non-neutral discharge
regime for the COST-Jet geometry. The findings are structured in two parts. First, characteristics
of this non-neutral regime are unraveled in terms of hybrid particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collisions
simulations. The simulation treats the electrons fully kinetically by invoking the PIC/MCC algorithm
while sparing computational effort by treating the ions as fluids. It is found that the electrons
are organized in a drift-soliton-like structure. The dynamics of this soliton-like structure
determine the electron dynamics of the system. The second part formulates a simplified analytical
model to describe the electron dynamics. In terms of this model, the formation of the soliton-like
structure and the connection between the soliton and the electron dynamics are investigated. The
discussion of the analytical model lays an emphasis on notions about the stability of the electron
group. This stability analysis includes the application of the Lyapunov method and a linear stability
analysis. To validate the conclusions drawn from the model, a comparison between numerical simulation
and model is performed. It reveals that a non-sophisticated model can capture essential characteristics
of a non-neutral discharge regime.

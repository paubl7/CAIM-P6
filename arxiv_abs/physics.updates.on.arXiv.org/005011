A new conservative symmetry-preserving second-order time-accurate PISO-based pressure-velocity
coupling for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured collocated
grids is presented in this paper. This new method for implicit time stepping is an extension of the
conservative symmetry-preserving incremental-pressure projection method for explicit time
stepping and unstructured collocated meshes of Trias et al. (2014). In order to assess and compare
both methods, we have implemented them within one unified solver in the open source code OpenFOAM.
We combine both methods with a Butcher tableau for a family of explicit and diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta
temporal schemes. We assess the energy conservation properties of the implemented discretisation
methods and the temporal consistency of the selected Runge-Kutta schemes using Taylor-Green vortex
and lid-driven cavity flow test cases. Although both implemented methods are based on a symmetry-preserving
discretisation, we show that both methods still produce a small amount of numerical dissipation
when the total pressure is directly solved from a Poisson equation. This numerical dissipation
is mainly caused by the corresponding pressure error which is of $O(\Delta t \Delta h^2)$. When an
incremental-pressure approach is used, where a pressure correction is solved from a Poisson equation,
the pressure error reduces to $O(\Delta t^2 \Delta h^2)$, yielding better conservation properties:
both methods are then effectively fully-conservative. Furthermore, we conclude that all selected
explicit and implicit higher order temporal schemes suffer from a reduction of the temporal order
to approximately one when the pressure Poisson equation is based on the total pressure due to the
presence of a pressure error of $O(\Delta t \Delta h^2)$.

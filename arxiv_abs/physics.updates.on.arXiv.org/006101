Quantum control, which refers to the active manipulation of physical systems described by the laws
of quantum mechanics, constitutes an essential ingredient for the development of quantum technology.
Here we apply Differentiable Programming (DP) and Natural Evolution Strategies (NES) to the optimal
transport of Majorana zero modes in superconducting nanowires, a key element to the success of Majorana-based
topological quantum computation. We formulate the motion control of Majorana zero modes as an optimization
problem for which we propose a new categorization of four different regimes with respect to the critical
velocity of the system and the total transport time. In addition to correctly recovering the anticipated
smooth protocols in the adiabatic regime, our algorithms uncover efficient but strikingly counter-intuitive
motion strategies in the non-adiabatic regime. The emergent picture reveals a simple but high fidelity
strategy that makes use of pulse-like jumps at the beginning and the end of the protocol with a period
of constant velocity in between the jumps, which we dub the jump-move-jump protocol. We provide
a transparent semi-analytical picture, which uses the sudden approximation and a reformulation
of the Majorana motion in a moving frame, to illuminate the key characteristics of the jump-move-jump
control strategy. We verify that the jump-move-jump protocol remains robust against the presence
of interactions or disorder, and corroborate its high efficacy on a realistic proximity coupled
nanowire model. Our results demonstrate that machine learning for quantum control can be applied
efficiently to quantum many-body dynamical systems with performance levels that make it relevant
to the realization of large-scale quantum technology.

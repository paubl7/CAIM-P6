The use of spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) to construct low-order models for broadband
turbulent flows is explored. The choice of SPOD modes as basis vectors is motivated by their optimality
and space-time coherence properties for statistically stationary flows. This work follows the
modeling paradigm that complex nonlinear fluid dynamics can be approximated as stochastically
forced linear systems. The proposed model combines ideas from Galerkin projection and linear multi-level
regression (MLR) modeling. The resulting stochastic two-level SPOD-Galerkin model governs a
compound state consisting of the modal expansion coefficients and forcing coefficients. In the
first level, the modal expansion coefficients are advanced by the forced linearized Navier-Stokes
operator under the linear time-invariant assumption. The second level governs the forcing coefficients,
which compensate for the offset between the linear approximation and the true state. At this level,
least squares regression is used to achieve closure by modeling nonlinear interactions between
modes. The statistics of the remaining residue are used to construct a dewhitening filter. This
filter facilitates the use of white noise to drive the stochastic flow model. The model is demonstrated
on large eddy simulation data of a turbulent jet at Mach number 0.9 and a Reynolds number of approximately
1M. The surrogate data obtained from the model accurately reproduces the second-order statistics
and dynamics of the input data, and instantaneous instances of the surrogate flow field are visually
indistinguishable from the original data. The model uncertainty, predictability, and stability
are quantified analytically, when possible, and through Monte Carlo simulation.

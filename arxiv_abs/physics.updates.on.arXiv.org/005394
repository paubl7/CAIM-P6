Measuring the abundance and isotopic composition of noble gases in planetary atmospheres can answer
fundamental questions in cosmochemistry and comparative planetology. However, noble gases are
rare elements, a feature making their measurement challenging even on Earth. Furthermore, in space
applications, power consumption, volume and mass constraints on spacecraft instrument accommodations
require the development of compact innovative instruments able to meet the engineering requirements
of the mission while still meeting the science requirements. Here we demonstrate the ability of
the quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (QITMS) developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Caltech,
Pasadena) to measure low quantities of heavy noble gases (Kr, Xe) in static operating mode and in
the absence of a buffer gas such as helium. The sensitivity reaches 1E13 cps Torr-1 (about 1011 cps/Pa)
of gas (Kr or Xe). The instrument is able to measure gas in static mode for extended periods of time
(up to 48 h) enabling the acquisition of thousands of isotope ratios per measurement. Errors on isotope
ratios follow predictions of the counting statistics and the instrument provides reproducible
results over several days of measurements. For example, 1.7E-10 Torr (2.3E-8 Pa) of Kr measured
continuously for 7 hours yielded a 0.6 permil precision on the 86Kr/84Kr ratio. Measurements of
terrestrial and extraterrestrial samples reproduce values from the literature. A compact instrument
based upon the QITMS design would have a sensitivity high enough to reach the precision on isotope
ratios (e.g. better than 1 percent for 129,131-136Xe/130Xe ratios) necessary for a scientific
payload measuring noble gases collected in the Venus atmosphere.

We study the d-HMF model proposed by Atenas and Curilef, a mean field model with long-range interactions
inspired by the dipole-dipole interaction. Among the challenges of this thesis is: the resolution
of the d-HMF model in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles and the analytical and numerical
description of the distribution function of the system. This model has been studied both in equilibrium
and out of equilibrium. In the equilibrium, analytical solutions have been found for internal energy
per particle and temperature using standard procedures through statistical mechanics such as
the calculation of the partition function in the canonical ensemble and the calculation of the number
of microstates accessible in the microcanonical ensemble. The results indicate that there is an
equivalence of ensembles. Additionally, we found the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) equilibrium distribution,
which coincides with the analytical results of the canonical and microcanonical ensembles and
molecular dynamics simulations. Then we focused on describing the Quasi-Stationary-States (QSS)
present in this system, by means of molecular dynamics simulations. Two types of QSS states are found
out of equilibrium. For its description, a combination of two techniques is used; the methods of
molecular dynamics and stationary solutions of the Vlasov equation associated with the equations
of motion of the system. From molecular we describe the marginal distributions in moments and orientations,
which were describe anaytically by means of stationary solutions of Vlasov equation. The stationary
solutions tested in this thesis correspond to distribution functions of the q-exponential type.
In particular, it is found that one of these solutions describes precisely the marginal distributions
of the moments and the orientations of one of the QSS states found with the molecular dynamics.

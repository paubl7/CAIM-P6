Aerosols sourced from combustion such as black carbon (BC) are important short-lived climate forcers
whose direct radiative forcing and atmospheric lifetime depend on their morphology. These aerosols'
complex morphology makes modeling their optical properties difficult, contributing to uncertainty
in both their direct and indirect climate effects. Accurate and fast calculations of BC optical
properties are needed for remote sensing inversions and for radiative forcing calculations in
atmospheric models, but current methods to accurately calculate the optical properties of these
aerosols are computationally expensive and are compiled in extensive databases off-line to be
used as a look-up table. Recent advances in machine learning approaches have shown the potential
of graph neural networks (GNN's) for various physical science applications, demonstrating skill
in generalizing beyond initial training data by learning internal properties and small-scale
interactions defining the emergent behavior of the larger system. Here we demonstrate that a GNN
trained to predict the optical properties of numerically-generated BC fractal aggregates can
accurately generalize to arbitrarily shaped particles, even over much larger (10x) aggregates
than in the training dataset, providing a fast and accurate method to calculate aerosol optical
properties in models and for observational retrievals. This zero-shot learning approach could
be integrated into atmospheric models or remote sensing inversions to predict the physical properties
of realistically-shaped aerosol and cloud particles. In addition, GNN's can be used to gain physical
intuition on the relationship between small-scale interactions (here of the spheres' positions
and interactions) and large-scale properties (here of the radiative properties of aerosols).

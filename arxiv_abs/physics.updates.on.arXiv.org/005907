In the COVID-19 pandemic, a range of epidemiological models have been used to predict the number
of new daily infections, $I$, daily rate of exponential growth, $r$, and effective reproduction
number, $R(t)$. These models differ in their approaches (e.g. mechanistic or empirical) and/or
assumptions about spatial or age mixing, and some capture uncertainty in scientific understanding
of disease dynamics, and/or have different simplifying assumptions. Combining estimates from
multiple models to better understand the variation of these outcome measures is important to help
inform decision making. We incorporate estimates of these outcome measures from a number of candidate
models for specific UK nations/regions using meta analysis. Random effects models have been implemented
to accommodate differing modelling approaches and assumptions between candidate models. Restricted
maximum likelihood (REML) is used to estimate the heterogeneity variance parameter, with two approaches
to calculate the confidence interval for the combined effect: standard Wald-type intervals and
the Knapp and Hartung (KNHA) method. Approaches using REML alone and REML+KNHA provided similar
ranges of variation for $R(t)$ and $r$. However, differences were observed when combining estimates
on $I$, with the REML+KNHA approach providing more conservative confidence intervals. This is
likely due to the limited number of candidate models contributing estimates for this outcome measure,
coupled with the large variability observed between model estimates. Utilising these meta-analysis
techniques has allowed for statistically robust combined estimates to be calculated for key COVID-19
outcome measures, allowing an overall assessment of the current response measures with associated
uncertainty. This in turn allows timely and informed decision making based on all available information.

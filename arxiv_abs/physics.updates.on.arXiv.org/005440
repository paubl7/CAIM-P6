The Picture Rocks Sun Dagger is a spiral petroglyph on a hillside northwest of Tucson that shows sun
dagger events at both the summer solstice and the equinoxes. On each of these dates, a wedge-shaped
sunbeam with opening angles 20{\deg}-30{\deg} touches the center of the spiral, with both of these
being confidently intentionally constructed by peoples of the Hohokam culture c. 800--1300 AD.
More generally for claimed sun daggers throughout the American Southwest, the critical question
is whether the ancient indigenous peoples intentionally placed the petroglyph so as to create a
solar marker. The confident starting point for proving the intentionality of sun daggers in general
is a histogram measured by the Prestons showing highly significant peaks for indicated declinations
within 2{\deg} of -23.4{\deg}, 0.0{\deg}, and +23.4{\deg}, with this being not by chance. In a review
of solsticial and equinoctal sun daggers, we find that they all have beams of light shaped like a long-thin
triangle with an apex opening angle of <40{\deg} that touches the center of the petroglyph symbol.
The majority of the sun daggers use a spiral petroglyph, with circles and other symbols being used.
Where a spiral or circular petroglyph has a coincidental light/shadow display, the false alarm
rate is measured to be 20% to 33%. Sun daggers that have indicated declinations other than +-23.4{\deg}
or 0.0{\deg} are false alarms, including claims for alignments to cross-quarter days and lunar
standstills, which are certainly wrong. Intentional sun daggers are not related to any form of calendric
regulation, astronomical tools, or public ceremony. Rather, abundant ethnographic evidence
shows that sun daggers are a part of sites, called Sun Shrines, where a local Sun watcher would have
lone vigils, with offerings and prayers to the gods on the solstices and equinoxes.

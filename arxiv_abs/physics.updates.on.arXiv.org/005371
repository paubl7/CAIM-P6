The electrical coupling between myocytes and fibroblasts and the spacial distribution of fibroblasts
within myocardial tissues are significant factors in triggering and sustaining cardiac arrhythmias
but their roles are poorly understood. This article describes both direct numerical simulations
and an asymptotic theory of propagation and block of electrical excitation in a model of atrial tissue
with myocyte-fibroblast coupling. In particular, three idealised fibroblast distributions
are introduced: uniform distribution, fibroblast barrier and myocyte strait, all believed to
be constituent blocks of realistic fibroblast distributions. Primary action potential biomarkers
including conduction velocity, peak potential and triangulation index are estimated from direct
simulations in all cases. Propagation block is found to occur at certain critical values of the parameters
defining each idealised fibroblast distribution and these critical values are accurately determined.
An asymptotic theory proposed earlier is extended and applied to the case of a uniform fibroblast
distribution. Biomarker values are obtained from hybrid analytical-numerical solutions of coupled
fast-time and slow-time periodic boundary value problems and compare well to direct numerical
simulations. The boundary of absolute refractoriness is determined solely by the fast-time problem
and is found to depend on the values of the myocyte potential and on the slow inactivation variable
of the sodium current ahead of the propagating pulse. In turn, these quantities are estimated from
the slow-time problem using a regular perturbation expansion to find the steady state of the coupled
myocyte-fibroblast kinetics. The asymptotic theory gives a simple analytical expression that
captures with remarkable accuracy the block of propagation in the presence of fibroblasts.

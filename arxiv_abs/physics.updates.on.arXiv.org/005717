In this work, we present NENCI-2021, a benchmark database of approximately $8,000$ non-equilibrium
non-covalent interaction energies for a large and diverse selection of intermolecular complexes
of biological and chemical relevance. To meet the growing demand for large and high-quality quantum
mechanical data in the chemical sciences, NENCI-2021 starts with the $101$ molecular dimers in
the widely used S66 and S101 databases, and extends the scope of these works by: (i) including $40$
cation- and anion-$\pi$ complexes, a fundamentally important class of non-covalent interactions
(NCIs) that are found throughout nature and pose a substantial challenge to theory, and (ii) systematically
sampling all $141$ intermolecular potential energy surfaces (PES) by simultaneously varying
the intermolecular distance and intermolecular angle in each dimer. Designed with an emphasis
on close contacts, the complexes in NENCI-2021 were generated by sampling seven intermolecular
distances along each PES (ranging from $0.7\times\mathrm{-}1.1\times$ the equilibrium separation)
as well as nine intermolecular angles per distance (five for each ion-$\pi$ complex), yielding
an extensive database of $7,763$ benchmark intermolecular interaction energies ($E_{\rm int}$)
obtained at the CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory. In addition, a wide range of intermolecular atom-pair
distances are also present in NENCI-2021, where close intermolecular contacts involving atoms
that are located within the so-called van der Waals envelope are prevalent -- these interactions
in particular pose an enormous challenge for molecular modeling and are observed in many important
chemical and biological systems. A detailed SAPT-based energy decomposition analysis also confirms
the diverse and comprehensive nature of the intermolecular binding motifs present in NENCI-2021.

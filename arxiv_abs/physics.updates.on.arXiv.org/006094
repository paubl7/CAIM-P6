The pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) method (where the excitation manifold is restricted to
electron pairs) has a series of interesting features. Among others, it provides ground-state energies
very close to what is obtained with doubly-occupied configuration interaction (DOCI), but with
polynomial cost (compared with the exponential cost of the latter). Here, we address whether this
similarity holds for excited states, by exploring the symmetric dissociation of the linear \ce{H4}
molecule. When ground-state Hartree-Fock (HF) orbitals are employed, pCCD and DOCI excited-state
energies do not match, a feature that is assigned to the poor HF reference. In contrast, by optimizing
the orbitals at the pCCD level (oo-pCCD) specifically for each excited state, the discrepancies
between pCCD and DOCI decrease by one or two orders of magnitude. Therefore, the pCCD and DOCI methodologies
still provide comparable energies for excited states, but only if suitable, state-specific orbitals
are adopted. We also assessed whether a pCCD approach could be used to directly target doubly-excited
states, without having to resort to the equation-of-motion (EOM) formalism. In our $\Delta$oo-pCCD
model, excitation energies were extracted from the energy difference between separate oo-pCCD
calculations for the ground state and the targeted excited state. For a set comprising the doubly-excited
states of \ce{CH+}, \ce{BH}, nitroxyl, nitrosomethane, and formaldehyde, we found that $\Delta$oo-pCCD
provides quite accurate excitation energies, with root mean square deviations (with respect to
full configuration interaction results) lower than CC3 and comparable to EOM-CCSDT, two methods
with much higher computational cost.

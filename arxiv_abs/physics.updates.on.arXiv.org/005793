The Venus Express Radio Science Experiment (VeRa) was part of the scientific payload of the Venus
Express (VEX) spacecraft and was targeted at the investigation of Venus' atmosphere, surface,
and gravity field as well as the interplanetary medium. This paper describes the methods and the
required calibrations applied to VEX-VeRa raw radio occultation selected data used to retrieve
vertical profiles of Venus' ionosphere and neutral atmosphere. In this work we analyze a set of 25
VEX, single-frequency (X-band), occultations carried out in 2014, recorded in open-loop at the
NASA Deep Space Network. The calibrations are performed to correct the observed frequency for the
major noise sources and errors, since any uncalibrated effects will bias the retrieval of atmospheric
properties. We show that the temperature differences between the relativistic and non-relativistic
Doppler shift solutions are lower than 0.5 K at 50 km altitude, so the relativity effects can safely
be neglected. Our temperature, pressure and electron density vertical profiles are in agreement
with previous studies available in the literature. Furthermore, our analysis shows that Venus'
ionosphere is more influenced by the day/night condition than the latitude variations, while the
neutral atmosphere experiences the opposite. Our scientific interpretation of these results
is based on two major responsible effects: Venus' high thermal inertia and the zonal winds. Their
presence within Venus' neutral atmosphere determine why in these regions a latitude dependence
is predominant on the day/night condition. On the contrary, at higher altitudes the two aforementioned
effects are less important or null, and Venus' ionosphere shows higher electron density peaks in
the probed day-time occultations, regardless of the latitude.

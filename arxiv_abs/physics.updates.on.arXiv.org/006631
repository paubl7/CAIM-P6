Reliable (accurate and precise) quantification of dose requires reliable absolute quantification
of regional activity uptake. This is especially challenging for alpha-particle emitting radiopharmaceutical
therapies ({\alpha}-RPTs) due to the complex emission spectra, the very low number of detected
counts, the impact of stray-radiation-related noise at these low counts, and other image-degrading
processes such as attenuation, scatter, and collimator-detector response. The conventional
reconstruction-based quantification methods are observed to be erroneous for {\alpha}-RPT SPECT.
To address these challenges, we developed an ultra-low-count quantitative SPECT (ULC-QSPECT)
method that incorporates multiple strategies to perform reliable quantification. First, the
method directly estimates the regional activity uptake from the projection data, obviating the
reconstruction step. This makes the problem more well-posed and avoids reconstruction-related
information loss. Next, the method compensates for radioisotope and SPECT physics, including
the isotope spectra, scatter, attenuation, and collimator-detector response, using a Monte Carlo-based
approach. Further, the method compensates for stray-radiation-related noise that becomes substantial
at these low-count levels. The method was validated in the context of three-dimensional SPECT with
223Ra. Validation was performed using both realistic simulation studies, as well as synthetic
and anthropomorphic physical-phantom studies. Across all studies, the ULC-QSPECT method yielded
reliable estimates of regional uptake and outperformed conventional ordered subset expectation
maximization (OSEM)-based reconstruction and geometric transfer matrix (GTM)-based partial-volume
compensation methods. Further, the method yielded reliable estimates of mean uptake in lesions
with varying intra-lesion heterogeneity in uptake.

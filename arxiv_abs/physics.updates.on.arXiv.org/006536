Postprocessing ensemble weather predictions to correct systematic errors has become a standard
practice in research and operations. However, only few recent studies have focused on ensemble
postprocessing of wind gust forecasts, despite its importance for severe weather warnings. Here,
we provide a comprehensive review and systematic comparison of eight statistical and machine learning
methods for probabilistic wind gust forecasting via ensemble postprocessing, that can be divided
in three groups: State of the art postprocessing techniques from statistics (ensemble model output
statistics (EMOS), member-by-member postprocessing, isotonic distributional regression),
established machine learning methods (gradient-boosting extended EMOS, quantile regression
forests) and neural network-based approaches (distributional regression network, Bernstein
quantile network, histogram estimation network). The methods are systematically compared using
six years of data from a high-resolution, convection-permitting ensemble prediction system that
was run operationally at the German weather service, and hourly observations at 175 surface weather
stations in Germany. While all postprocessing methods yield calibrated forecasts and are able
to correct the systematic errors of the raw ensemble predictions, incorporating information from
additional meteorological predictor variables beyond wind gusts leads to significant improvements
in forecast skill. In particular, we propose a flexible framework of locally adaptive neural networks
with different probabilistic forecast types as output, which not only significantly outperform
all benchmark postprocessing methods but also learn physically consistent relations associated
with the diurnal cycle, especially the evening transition of the planetary boundary layer.

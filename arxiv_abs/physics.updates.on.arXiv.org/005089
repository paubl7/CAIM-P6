In the present study we demonstrate for the first time how Astigmatism Particle Tracking Velocimetry
(APTV) can be utilized to measure suspensions dynamics. Measurements were successfully performed
in monodisperse, refractive index matched suspensions of up to a volume fraction of $\Phi=19.9\%$.
For this, a small percentage of the particles is labeled with fluorescent dye acting as tracers for
the particle tracking procedure. Calibration results show, that a slight deviation of the refractive
index of liquid and particles leads to a strong shape change of the calibration curve with respect
to the unladen case. This effect becomes more severe along the channel height. To compensate the
shape change of the calibration curves the interpolation technique developed by Brockmann et al.
(Experiments in Fluids, 61(2), 67, \citeyear{brockmann2020utilizing}) is adapted. Using this
technique, the interpolation procedure is applied to suspensions with 6 different volume fractions
ranging from $\Phi<0.01\%$ to $\Phi=19.9\%$. To determine the effect of volume fraction on the
perfomance of the method, the depth reconstruction error $\sigma_z$ and the measurement volume
depth $\Delta z$, obtained in different calibration measurements, are estimated. Here, a relative
position reconstruction accuracy of $\sigma_z$/$\Delta z$=0.90\% and $\sigma_z$/$\Delta z$=2.53\%
is achieved for labeled calibration particles in dilute ($\Phi<0.01\%$) and semi-dilute ($\Phi\approx19.9\%$)
suspensions, respectively. The measurement technique is validated for a laminar flow in a straight
rectangular channel with a cross-sectional area of 2.55$\times$30\,mm$^2$. Uncertainties of
1.39\% and 3.34\% for the in-plane and 9.04\% and 22.57\% for the out-of-plane velocity with respect
to the maximum streamwise velocity are achieved, at solid volume fractions of $\Phi<0.01\%$ and
$\Phi=19.9\%$, respectively.

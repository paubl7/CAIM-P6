Purpose: To compare the segmentation and detection performance of a deep learning model trained
on a database of human-labelled clinical diffusion-weighted (DW) stroke lesions to a model trained
on the same database enhanced with synthetic DW stroke lesions. Methods: In this institutional
review board approved study, a stroke database of 962 cases (mean age 65+/-17 years, 255 males, 449
scans with DW positive stroke lesions) and a normal database of 2,027 patients (mean age 38+/-24
years,1088 females) were obtained. Brain volumes with synthetic DW stroke lesions were produced
by warping the relative signal increase of real strokes to normal brain volumes. A generic 3D U-Net
was trained on four different databases to generate four different models: (a) 375 neuroradiologist-labeled
clinical DW positive stroke cases(CDB);(b) 2,000 synthetic cases(S2DB);(c) CDB+2,000 synthetic
cases(CS2DB); or (d) CDB+40,000 synthetic cases(CS40DB). The models were tested on 20%(n=192)
of the cases of the stroke database, which were excluded from the training set. Segmentation accuracy
was characterized using Dice score and lesion volume of the stroke segmentation, and statistical
significance was tested using a paired, two-tailed, Student's t-test. Detection sensitivity
and specificity was compared to three neuroradiologists. Results: The performance of the 3D U-Net
model trained on the CS40DB(mean Dice 0.72) was better than models trained on the CS2DB (0.70,P <0.001)
or the CDB(0.65,P<0.001). The deep learning model was also more sensitive (91%[89%-93%]) than
each of the three human readers(84%[81%-87%],78%[75%-81%],and 79%[76%-82%]), but less specific(75%[72%-78%]
vs for the three human readers (96%[94%-97%],92%[90%-94%] and 89%[86%-91%]). Conclusion: Deep
learning training for segmentation and detection of DW stroke lesions was significantly improved
by enhancing the training set with synthetic lesions.

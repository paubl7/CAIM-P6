Spin-dependent charge transfer decay in an alkali atom doped polyacetylene is studied in terms
of the complex spectral analysis, revealing the single-spin Zeeman splitting influenced by the
spin-orbit interaction. Nonhermitian effective Hamiltonian has been derived from the total system
hermitian Hamiltonian using Brillouin-Wigner-Feshbach projection method, where the microscopic
spin-dependent dissipation effect is correctly incorporated in the energy-dependent self-energy.
Since the present method maintains the dynamical and chiral symmetries of the total system, we discovered
two types of exceptional point (EP) singularities in a unified perspective: the EP surface and EP
ring are attributed to the dynamical and chiral symmetry breaking, respectively. We have revealed
that the coherent single-spin electron resonance (SSESR) spectrum reflects the complex eigenenergy
spectrum of the system. We have formulated the SSESR spectrum in terms of the nonlinear response
function in the Liouville-space pathway approach, where we have constructed the Liouville space
basis using the complex eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian. We have calculated the one- and two-dimensional
Fourier transform SSESR (1DFT and 2DFT) spectra reflecting the spin-relaxation dynamics at the
donor site. While the 1DFT SSESR spectrum reflects the complex eigenenergy spectrum, the 2DFT gives
detailed information on the quantum coherence in the spin-relaxation dynamics as a cross-correlation
between the two frequencies. We found a giant response of the coherent SSESR around the EP ring singularity
due to the vanishing normalization factors at the EP ring and the resonance effect. We have discovered
that the giant response is much larger in magnitudes in the 2DFT spectrum than in the 1DFT spectrum,
which promises the 2DFT SSESR a useful tool to observe the single-spin response in a molecule.

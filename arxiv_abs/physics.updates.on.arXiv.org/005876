We present a real-space formulation and implementation of Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory
suited to twisted geometries, and apply it to the study of torsional deformations of X (X = C, Si, Ge,
Sn) nanotubes. Our formulation is based on higher order finite difference discretization in helical
coordinates, uses ab intio pseudopotentials, and naturally incorporates rotational (cyclic)
and screw operation (i.e., helical) symmetries. We discuss several aspects of the computational
method, including the form of the governing equations, details of the numerical implementation,
as well as its convergence, accuracy and efficiency properties. The technique presented here is
particularly well suited to the first principles simulation of quasi-one-dimensional structures
and their deformations, and many systems of interest can be investigated using small simulation
cells containing just a few atoms. We apply the method to systematically study the properties of
single-wall zigzag and armchair group-IV nanotubes, as they undergo twisting. For the range of
deformations considered, the mechanical behavior of the tubes is found to be largely consistent
with isotropic linear elasticity, with the torsional stiffness varying as the cube of the nanotube
radius. Furthermore, for a given tube radius, this quantity is seen to be highest for carbon nanotubes
and the lowest for those of tin, while nanotubes of silicon and germanium have intermediate values
close to each other. We also describe different aspects of the variation in electronic properties
of the nanotubes as they are twisted. In particular, we find that akin to the well known behavior of
armchair carbon nanotubes, armchair nanotubes of silicon, germanium and tin also exhibit bandgaps
that vary periodically with imposed rate of twist, and that the periodicity of the variation scales
in an inverse quadratic manner with the tube radius.

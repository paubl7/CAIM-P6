Over the last two decades, alongside the increased availability of large network datasets, we have
witnessed the rapid rise of network science. For many systems, however, the data we have access to
is not a direct description of the underlying network. More and more, we see the drive to study networks
that have been inferred or reconstructed from non-network data---in particular, using time series
data from the nodes in a system to infer likely connections between them. Selecting the most appropriate
technique for this task is a challenging problem in network science. Different reconstruction
techniques usually have different assumptions, and their performance varies from system to system
in the real world. One way around this problem could be to use several different reconstruction techniques
and compare the resulting networks. However, network comparison is also not an easy problem, as
it is not obvious how best to quantify the differences between two networks, in part because of the
diversity of tools for doing so. The netrd Python package seeks to address these two parallel problems
in network science by providing, to our knowledge, the most extensive collection of both network
reconstruction techniques and network comparison techniques (often referred to as graph distances)
in a single library (https://github.com/netsiphd/netrd). In this article, we detail the two main
functionalities of the netrd package. Along the way, we describe some of its other useful features.
This package builds on commonly used Python packages and is already a widely used resource for network
scientists and other multidisciplinary researchers. With ongoing open-source development,
we see this as a tool that will continue to be used by all sorts of researchers to come.

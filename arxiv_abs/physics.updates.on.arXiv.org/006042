Fluid transport networks are important in many natural settings and engineering applications,
from animal cardiovascular and respiratory systems to plant vasculature to plumbing networks
and chemical plants. Understanding how network topology, connectivity, internal boundaries
and other geometrical aspects affect the global flow state is a challenging problem that depends
on complex fluid properties characterized by different length and time scales. The study of flow
in micro-scale networks focuses on low Reynolds numbers where small volumes of fluids move at slow
speeds. The flow physics at these scales is governed by the Stokes equation, which is linear. This
linearity property allows for relatively simple theoretical and computational solutions that
greatly aid in the understanding, modeling and designing of micro-scale networks. At larger scales
and faster flow rates, macrofluidic networks are also important but the flow physics is quite different.
The underlying Navier-Stokes equation is nonlinear, theoretical results are few, simulations
are challenging, and the mapping between geometry and desired flow objectives are all much more
complex. The phenomenology for such high-Reynolds-number or inertially-dominated flows is well
documented and well-studied: Flows are retarded in thin boundary layers near solid surfaces; such
flows are sensitive to geometry and tend to separate from surfaces; and vortices, wakes, jets and
unsteadiness abound. The counter-intuitive nature of inertial flows is exemplified by the breakdown
of reversibility. This dissertation explores two general ways of how rectified flows emerge in
macrofluidic networks as a consequence of irreversibility and unsteady effects: When branches
or channels of a network have asymmetric internal geometry and the second when a network contains
loops.

The LHC will undergo a major upgrade starting in 2025 towards the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) to
increase the instantaneous luminosity by a factor of 5 to 7 compared to the nominal value. The Phase-II
Upgrade (2025-2027) will require the trigger and readout electronics of the ATLAS experiment to
operate with the stringent conditions imposed by the HL-LHC. During this upgrade, both on- and off-detector
readout electronics of TileCal will be completely replaced with a new data acquisition which will
provide full-granularity information to the ATLAS trigger system. The Compact Processing Modules
are responsible for the LHC bunch-crossing clock distribution towards the detector, configuration
of the on-detector electronics, data acquisition, cell energy reconstruction, and data transmission
to the TDAQ interface (TDAQi). The CPM has been designed as an AMC form-factor board equipped with
8 Samtec FireFly modules for communication with the detector, a Xilinx Kintex UltraScale FPGA for
data acquisition and processing, a Xilinx Artix 7 FPGA for slow control and monitoring, and other
subsystems to generate high-quality clocks for the FPGAs and communications. The high-speed communication
with the on-detector electronics is implemented via 32 GigaBit Transceiver links receiving detector
data at 9.6 Gbps and transmitting commands and the LHC clock at 4.8 Gbps, while the reconstructed
cell energies are transmitted to TDAQi via 4 FULL-mode links. Triggered data is transmitted through
a FULL-mode link to the ATLAS TDAQ system via the FELIX network. This paper introduces the design
of the Compact Processing Modules for the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter Phase-II Upgrade and the results
and experiences with the first prototypes.

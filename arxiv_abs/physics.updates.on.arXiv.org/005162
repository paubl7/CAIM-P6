Packed bed plasma reactors (PBPRs) inherently have complex geometries where the volume between
the electrodes is filled with dielectric/catalytic pellets to form an array of voids and cavities.
This design generates multiple length scales i.e. the dimension of the plasma region (of the order
of centimeters), of the dielectric/catalytic pellets (of the order of millimeters) and of the void
between the dielectrics (or cavities) and/or surface pores that can reach micrometer dimensions.
The plasma is formed as an array of connected or segmented microdischarges. The understanding of
plasma propagation on these diverse length scales is important in optimizing and controlling this
process. In this work, we investigate the discharge formation and propagation at different length
scales as a function of applied voltage in a simplified design of PBPRs, a patterned dielectric barrier
discharge (p-DBD), operated in helium at atmospheric pressure, using phase and space resolved
optical emission spectroscopy (PROES). The p-DBD is based on an array of plasma facing glass hemispheres
implemented into one of two electrodes and regularly arranged in a hexagonal pattern. The plasma
is initiated as filamentary microdischarges at the positions of minimum gap followed by radial
acceleration of electrons over the dielectric surface as surface ionization waves to finally form
surface microdischarges at the voids between the pellets, i.e. at the contact points. With the increase
of the voltage amplitude, subsequent pulses of surface microdischarges are generated at the contact
points. The plasma emission of each of the surface micro-discharges (S-MD) is found to consist of
microscopic structures whose emission intensity increases as a function of the driving voltage
amplitude. Adjacent microdischarges interact to generate a wave-like emission intensity propagation
from the center of the array to the edges.

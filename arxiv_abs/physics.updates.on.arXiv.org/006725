We present a hybrid CCSD(T)+PBE-D3 approach to calculating the vibrational signatures for gas
phase benzene and benzene adsorbed on an ordered water-ice surface. We compare the results of our
method against experimentally recorded spectra and calculations performed using PBE-D3-only
approaches (harmonic and anharmonic). Calculations use a proton ordered XIh water-ice surface
consisting of 288 water molecules, and results are compared against experimental spectra recorded
for an ASW ice surface. We show the importance of including a water ice surface into spectroscopic
calculations, owing to the resulting differences in vibrational modes, frequencies and intensities
of transitions seen in the IR spectrum. The overall intensity pattern shifts from a dominating $\nu_{11}$
band in the gas-phase to several high-intensity carriers for an IR spectrum of adsorbed benzene.
When used for adsorbed benzene, the hybrid approach presented here achieves an RMSD for IR active
modes of 21~cm$^{-1}$, compared to 72~cm$^{-1}$ and 49~cm$^{-1}$ for the anharmonic and harmonic
PBE-D3 approaches, respectively. Our hybrid model for gaseous benzene also achieves the best results
when compared to experiment, with an RMSD for IR active modes of 24~cm$^{-1}$, compared to 55~cm$^{-1}$
and 31~cm$^{-1}$ for the anharmonic and harmonic PBE-D3 approaches, respectively. To facilitate
assignment, we generate and provide a correspondence graph between the normal modes of the gaseous
and adsorbed benzene molecules. Finally, we calculate the frequency shifts, $\Delta\nu$, of adsorbed
benzene relative to its gas phase to highlight the effects of surface interactions on vibrational
bands and evaluate the suitability of our chosen dispersion-corrected density functional theory.

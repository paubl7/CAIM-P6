We present a many-body expansion (MBE) formulation and implementation for efficient computation
of analytical energy gradients from OSV-MP2 theory based on our earlier work (Zhou et al. J. Chem.
Theory Comput. 2020, 16, 196-210). The third-order MBE(3) expansion of OSV-MP2 wavefunction was
developed to adopt the orbital-specific clustering and long-range termination schemes, which
avoids term-by-term differentiations of the MBE energy bodies. We achieve better efficiency by
exploiting the algorithmic sparsity that allows to prune out insignificant fitting integrals
and OSV relaxations. With these approximations, the present implementation is benchmarked on
a range of molecules that show an economic scaling in the linear and quadratic regimes for computing
MBE(3)-OSV-MP2 amplitude and gradient equations, respectively, and yields normal accuracy comparable
to the original OSV-MP2 results. The MPI-3-based parallelism through shared memory one-sided
communication is further developed for improving parallel scalability and memory accessibility
by sorting the MBE(3) orbital clusters into independent tasks that are distributed on multiple
processes across many nodes, supporting both global and local data locations in which selected
MBE(3)-OSV-MP2 intermediates of different sizes are distinguished and accordingly placed. The
accuracy and efficiency level of our MBE(3)-OSV-MP2 analytical gradient implementation is finally
illustrated in two applications: we show that the subtle coordination structure differences of
mechanically interlocked Cu-catenane complexes can be distinguished when tuning ligand lengths;
and the porphycene molecular dynamics reveals the emergence of the vibrational signature arising
from softened N-H stretching associated with hydrogen transfer, using an MP2 level of electron
correlation and classical nuclei for the first time.

An encoder-decoder neural network has been used to examine the possibility for acceleration of
a partial integro-differential equation, the Fokker-Planck-Landau collision operator. This
is part of the governing equation in the massively parallel particle-in-cell code, XGC, which is
used to study turbulence in fusion energy devices. The neural network emphasizes physics-inspired
learning, where it is taught to respect physical conservation constraints of the collision operator
by including them in the training loss, along with the L2 loss. In particular, network architectures
used for the computer vision task of semantic segmentation have been used for training. A penalization
method is used to enforce the "soft" constraints of the system and integrate error in the conservation
properties into the loss function. During training, quantities representing the density, momentum,
and energy for all species of the system is calculated at each configuration vertex, mirroring the
procedure in XGC. This simple training has produced a median relative loss, across configuration
space, on the order of 10E-04, which is low enough if the error is of random nature, but not if it is of
drift nature in timesteps. The run time for the Picard iterative solver of the operator scales as
order n squared, where n is the number of plasma species. As the XGC1 code begins to attack problems
including a larger number of species, the collision operator will become expensive computationally,
making the neural network solver even more important, since the training only scales as n. A wide
enough range of collisionality is considered in the training data to ensure the full domain of collision
physics is captured. An advanced technique to decrease the losses further will be discussed, which
will be subject of a subsequent report. Eventual work will include expansion of the network to include
multiple plasma species.

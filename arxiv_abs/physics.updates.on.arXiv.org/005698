Since solid-state heat transport in a highly porous nanocomposite strongly depends on the thermal
boundary conductance (TBC) between constituent nanomaterials, further suppression of the TBC
is important for improving performance of thermal insulators. Here, targeting a nanocomposite
fabricated by stamping fumed silica nanoparticles, we perform a wide variety of surface functionalization
on fumed silica nanoparticles by silane coupling method and investigate the impact on the thermal
conductivity (Km). The Km of the silica nanocomposite is approximately 20 and 9 mW/m/K under atmospheric
and vacuum condition at the material density of 0.2 g/cm3 without surface functionalization, respectively,
and the experimental results indicate that the Km can be modulated depending on the chemical structure
of molecules. The surface modification with a linear alkyl chain of optimal length significantly
suppresses Km by approximately 30%, and the suppression can be further enhanced to approximately
50% with the infrared opacifier. The magnitude of suppression was found to sensitively depend on
the length of terminal chain. The magnitude is also related to the number of reactive silanol groups
in the chemical structure, where the surface modification with fluorocarbon gives the largest
suppression. The surface hydrophobization merits thermal insulation through significant suppression
of the TBC, presumably by reducing the water molecules that otherwise would serve as heat conduction
channels at the interface. On the other hand, when the chain length is long, the suppression is counteracted
by the enhanced phonon transmission through the silane coupling molecules that grows with the chain
length. This is supported by the analytical model and present simulation results, leading to predict
the optimal chemical structure for better thermal insulation.

The phase field fracture method has emerged as a promising computational tool for modelling a variety
of problems including, since recently, hydrogen embrittlement and stress corrosion cracking.
In this work, we demonstrate the potential of phase field-based multi-physics models in transforming
the engineering assessment and design of structural components in hydrogen-containing environments.
First, we present a theoretical and numerical framework coupling deformation, diffusion and fracture,
which accounts for inertia effects.Several constitutive choices are considered for the crack
density function, including choices with and without an elastic phase in the damage response. The
material toughness is defined as a function of the hydrogen content using an atomistically-informed
hydrogen degradation law. The model is numerically implemented in 2D and 3D using the finite element
method. The resulting computational framework is used to address a number of case studies of particular
engineering interest. These are intended to showcase the model capabilities in: (i) capturing
complex fracture phenomena, such as dynamic crack branching or void-crack interactions, (ii)
simulating standardised tests for critical components, such as bolts, and (iii) enabling simulation-based
paradigms such as Virtual Testing or Digital Twins by coupling model predictions with inspection
data of large-scale engineering components. The evolution of defects under in-service conditions
can be predicted, up to the ultimate failure. By reproducing the precise geometry of the defects,
as opposed to re-characterising them as sharp cracks, phase field modelling enables more realistic
and effective structural integrity assessments.

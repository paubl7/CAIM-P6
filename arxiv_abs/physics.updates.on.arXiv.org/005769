Traditionally, optimization of radiation therapy (RT) treatment plans has been done before the
initiation of RT course, using population-wide estimates for patients' response to therapy. However,
recent technological advancements have enabled monitoring individual patient response during
the RT course, in the form of biomarkers. Although biomarker data remains subject to substantial
uncertainties, information extracted from this data may allow the RT plan to be adapted in a biologically
informative way. We present a mathematical framework that optimally adapts the treatment-length
of an RT plan based on the acquired mid-treatment biomarker information, while accounting for the
inexact nature of this information. We formulate the adaptive treatment-length optimization
problem as a 2-stage problem, wherein the information about the model parameters gathered during
the first stage influences the decisions in the second stage. Using Adjustable Robust Optimization
(ARO) techniques we derive explicit optimal decision rules for the stage-2 decisions and solve
the optimization problem. The problem allows for multiple worst-case optimal solutions. To discriminate
between these, we introduce the concept of Pareto Adjustable Robustly Optimal (PARO) solutions.
In numerical experiments using lung cancer patient data, the ARO method is benchmarked against
several other static and adaptive methods. In case of exact biomarker information, there is sufficient
space to adapt, and numerical results show that taking into account both robustness and adaptability
is not necessary. In case of inexact biomarker information, accounting for adaptability and inexactness
of biomarker information is particularly beneficial when robustness (w.r.t. organ-at-risk (OAR)
constraint violations) is of high importance. If minor OAR violations are allowed, a nominal folding
horizon approach is a good performing alternative.

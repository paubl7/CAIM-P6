Rockfalls pose a substantial threat to ground transportation, due to their rapidity, destructive
potential and high probability of occurrence on steep topographies, often found along roads and
railway routes. Various factors trigger rockfalls, including rainfall and seismic activity,
and diverse phenomena affect their probability of occurrence. Approaches for the assessment of
rockfall susceptibility range from purely phenomenological and statistical methods, suitable
for modeling large areas, to purely deterministic ones, usually easier to use in local analyses.
A common requirement is to locate potential detachment points, often found uphill on cliffs, and
the subsequent assessment of the runout of rockfalls stemming from such points. Here, we apply a
physically based model for the calculation of rockfall trajectories along the Italian railway
network, within a corridor of total length of about 17,000 km and varying width. We propose a data-driven
method for the location of rockfall source points based on expert mapping of potential sources on
sample representative locations. Using empirical distributions of gridded slope values in source
areas mapped by experts, we derived probabilistic maps of rockfall sources in the proximity of the
railway network, regardless of a particular trigger. Source areas act as starting points of simulated
trajectories, within the three-dimensional model STONE. The program provides a pixel-by-pixel
trajectory count, which we classify into a susceptibility map. We obtained the map analyzing the
railway track as a collection of segments, for which we provide segment-wise rockfall susceptibility.
Eventually, we considered an equivalent graph representation of the network, which helps classifying
classifying the segments both on the basis of rockfall susceptibility and the role of each segment
in the network, resulting in a network-ranked susceptibility.

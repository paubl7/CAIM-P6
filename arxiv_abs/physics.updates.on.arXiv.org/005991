The lithium vapor box divertor aims to detach the divertor plasma via evaporating and condensing
lithium surfaces. By evaporating lithium near or at the divertor plate and condensing it closer
to the main chamber, a lithium vapor density gradient can be created. This density gradient ties
energy losses to poloidal distance between the target and the detachment point. The radiation zone
is then prevented from reaching the X-point as the lithium ionization rate decreases when the detachment
front moves away from the divertor target. Here we present Scrape Off Layer Plasma Simulator (SOLPS)
simulations of a lithium vapor box divertor using an NSTX-U equilibrium and PFC geometry. The parameters
for the core boundary conditions, gas puff intensity, and heat and particle transport coefficients
are chosen to match experimental values. Acceptable agreement with experimental Scrape-Off Layer
(SOL) widths is found, indicating a reasonable choice of transport coefficients. In predictive
simulations, lithium is added via evaporation at the target. Predictions for peak heat fluxes and
upstream impurity concentration are given for a variety of evaporation rates. Target electron
temperature is predicted to be able to be reduced to recombination levels (below 1 eV) for lithium
evaporation rates of $1\cdot10^{23}$ Li/s, indicating detachment. Peak heat flux at the lower
outer target could be reduced by as much as a factor of six while maintaining upstream lithium fractions
below 2%. The prevention of lithium from reaching the midplane is shown to be due to an increase in
frictional forces acting on the lithium from a deuterium gas puff. Lithium is also shown to be redeposited
close to the evaporator which is favorable for initial tests and future capillary porous systems.

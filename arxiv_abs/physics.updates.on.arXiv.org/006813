Space weathering is a process that changes the surface of airless planetary bodies. Prime space
weathering agents are solar wind irradiation and micrometeoroid bombardment. These processes
alter planetary reflectance spectra and often modify their compositional diagnostic features.
In this work we focused on simulating and comparing the spectral changes caused by solar wind irradiation
and by micrometeoroid bombardment to gain a better understanding of these individual space weathering
processes. We used olivine and pyroxene pellets as proxies for planetary materials. To simulate
solar wind irradiation we used hydrogen, helium, and argon ions with energies from 5 to 40 keV and
fluences of up to $10^{18}$ particles/cm$^2$. To simulate micrometeoroid bombardment we used
individual femtosecond laser pulses. We analysed the corresponding evolution of different spectral
parameters, which we determined by applying the Modified Gaussian Model, and we also conducted
principal component analysis. The original mineralogy of the surface influences the spectral
evolution more than the weathering agent, as seen from the diverse evolution of the spectral slope
of olivine and pyroxene upon irradiation. The spectral slope changes seen in olivine are consistent
with observations of A-type asteroids, while the moderate to no slope changes observed in pyroxene
are consistent with asteroid (4) Vesta. We also observed some differences in the spectral effects
induced by the two weathering agents. Ions simulating solar wind have a smaller influence on longer
wavelengths of the spectra than laser irradiation simulating micrometeoroid impacts. This is
most likely due to the different penetration depths of ions and laser pulses. Our results suggest
that in some instances it might be possible to distinguish between the contributions of the two agents
on a weathered surface.

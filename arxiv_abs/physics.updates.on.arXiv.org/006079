Enzymes have been recently proposed to have mechanical activity associated with their chemical
activity. In a number of recent studies, it has been reported that enzymes undergo enhanced diffusion
in the presence of their corresponding substrate, when this substrate is uniformly distributed
in solution. Moreover, if the concentration of the substrate is non-uniform, enzymes and other
small molecules have been reported to show chemotaxis -- biased stochastic movement in the direction
of the substrate gradient -- typically towards higher concentrations of this substrate, with a
few exceptions. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for enhanced diffusion and chemotaxis
at the nanoscale, however, are still not well understood. Understanding these processes is important
both for fundamental biological research, e.g. in the context of spatial organization of enzymes
in metabolic pathways (metabolon formation), as well as for engineering applications, such as
in the design of new vehicles for targeted drug delivery. In this Account, we will review the available
experimental observations of both enhanced diffusion and chemotaxis, and we will discuss critically
the different theories that have been proposed to explain the two. We first focus on enhanced diffusion,
beginning with an overview of the experimental results. We then discuss the two main types of mechanisms
that have been proposed, namely active mechanisms relying on the catalytic step of the enzymatic
reaction, and equilibrium mechanisms which consider the reversible binding and unbinding of the
substrate to the enzyme. We put particular emphasis on an equilibrium model recently introduced
by us, which describes how the diffusion of dumbbell-like modular enzymes can be enhanced in the
presence of substrate, thanks to a binding-induced reduction of the internal fluctuations of the
enzyme. We then turn to chemotaxis, [...]

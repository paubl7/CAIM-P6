Ianniruberto and Marrucci developed a theory whereby entangled branched polymers behave like
linear ones in fast elongational flows. In order to test such prediction, Huang et al. performed
elongational measurements on star polymer melts, indeed revealing that, in fast flows, the elongational
viscosity is insensitive to the molecular structure, provided the molecular weight of the backbone
is the same. Inspired by these studies, we here report on results obtained with multi-chain slip-link
simulations for symmetric and asymmetric star polymer melts, as well as calculations of the Rouse
time of the examined branched structures. The simulations semi-quantitatively reproduce the
experimental data if the Kuhn-segment orientation-induced reduction of friction (SORF) is accounted
for. The observed insensitivity of the nonlinear elongational viscosity to the molecular structure
for the same span molar mass may be due to several factors. In the symmetric case, the calculated Rouse
time of the star marginally differs from that of the linear molecule, so that possible differences
in the observed stress fall within the experimental uncertainty. Secondly, it is possible that
the flow-induced formation of hooked star pairs makes the effective Rouse time of the aggregate
even closer to that of the linear polymer because the friction center moves towards the branchpoint
of the star molecule. In the asymmetric case, it is shown that the stress contributed by the short
arms is negligible with respect to that of the long ones. However, such stress-reduction is balanced
by a dilution effect whereby the unstretched arms reduce SORF as they decrease the Kuhn-segment
order parameter of the system. As a result of that dilution, the stress contributed by the backbone
is larger. The two effects compensate one another so that the overall stress is virtually the same
as the other architectures.

In tumor segmentation, inter-observer variation is acknowledged to be a significant problem.
This is even more significant in clinical target volume (CTV) segmentation, specifically, in post-operative
settings, where a gross tumor does not exist. In this scenario, CTV is not an anatomically established
structure but rather one determined by the physician based on the clinical guideline used, the preferred
trade off between tumor control and toxicity, their experience, training background etc... This
results in high inter-observer variability between physicians. Inter-observer variability
has been considered an issue, however its dosimetric consequence is still unclear, due to the absence
of multiple physician CTV contours for each patient and the significant amount of time required
for dose planning. In this study, we analyze the impact that these physician stylistic variations
have on organs-at-risk (OAR) dose by simulating the clinical workflow using deep learning. For
a given patient previously treated by one physician, we use DL-based tools to simulate how other
physicians would contour the CTV and how the corresponding dose distributions should look like
for this patient. To simulate multiple physician styles, we use a previously developed in-house
CTV segmentation model that can produce physician style-aware segmentations. The corresponding
dose distribution is predicted using another in-house deep learning tool, which, averaging across
all structures, is capable of predicting dose within 3% of the prescription dose on the test data.
For every test patient, four different physician-style CTVs are considered and four different
dose distributions are analyzed. OAR dose metrics are compared, showing that even though physician
style variations results in organs getting different doses, all the important dose metrics except
Maximum Dose point are within the clinically acceptable limit.

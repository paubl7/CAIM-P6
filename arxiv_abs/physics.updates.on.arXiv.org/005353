This paper discusses the numerical investigation of the surface roughness effect on the supercritical
water flow. A computational attempt has been made to understand the alteration in heat transfer
characteristics of supercritical flow due to roughness presence, which remains unexplored. For
smooth circular pipe, simulations are performed (using Ansys Fluent) for Shitsman's experimental
setup that reported two peaks in wall temperature. The results are in fair agreement with the reported
data. This analysis has been further extrapolated for rough pipes by incorporating a roughness
model based on the Nikuradse experimental findings for pipe with tightly packed uniform sand-grain
roughness. The study spans over different roughness values, and it is observed that the heat transfer
deterioration (HTD), which was apparent in the smooth pipe vanished gradually as the roughness
value increases, eventually resulting in the smooth wall temperature profile. The different calculated
parameters such as heat transfer coefficient, average pressure loss, average turbulent kinetic
energy (TKE), and TKE production term revealed that the significant effect of roughness on the flow
is evident only after a specific roughness value. However, this rough pipe behavior is similar to
what one would expect in the subcritical flow; the wall temperature maxima is sensitive to the smallest
roughness presence. Besides, the entropy generation values are enumerated for different roughness
to gain a better insight into heat transfer. This calculation shows that the contribution in entropy
production due to the thermal gradient is much higher than the dissipation. Also, the total entropy
generation peaked at some intermediate value of roughness. The observed maximum can be attributed
to the supercritical fluids properties variation with temperature.

Viscoelastic surface rheology plays an important role in multiphase systems. A typical example
is the actin cortex which surrounds most animal cells. It shows elastic properties for short time
scales and behaves viscous for longer time scales. Hence, realistic simulations of cell shape dynamics
require a model capturing the entire elastic to viscous spectrum. However, currently there are
no numerical methods to simulate deforming viscoelastic surfaces. Thus models for the cell cortex,
or other viscoelastic surfaces, are usually based on assumptions or simplifications which limit
their applicability. In this paper we develop a first numerical approach for simulation of deforming
viscoelastic surfaces. To this end, we derive the surface equivalent of the upper convected Maxwell
model using the GENERIC formulation of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The model distinguishes
between shear dynamics and dilatational surface dynamics. The viscoelastic surface is embedded
in a viscous fluid modelled by the Navier-Stokes equation. Both systems are solved using Finite
Elements. The fluid and surface are combined using an Arbitrary Lagrange-Eulerian (ALE) Method
that conserves the surface grid spacing during rotations and translations of the surface. We verify
this numerical implementation against analytic solutions and find good agreement. To demonstrate
its potential we simulate the experimentally observed tumbling and tank-treading of vesicles
in shear flow. We also supply a phase-diagram to demonstrate the influence of the viscoelastic parameters
on the behaviour of a vesicle in shear flow. Finally, we explore cytokinesis as a future application
of the numerical method by simulating the start of cytokinesis using a spatially dependent function
for the surface tension.

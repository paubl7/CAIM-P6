High-fidelity large-eddy simulations (LES) are performed to investigate aeroacoustic characteristics
of jets issuing from twin rectangular nozzles with an aspect ratio of 2:1 at two over-expanded conditions
and the design condition. For all three jet conditions simulated, LES predicts qualitatively similar
near-field flow statistics to those measured at the University of Cincinnati. Using the Ffowcs
Williams-Hawkings method, LES captures the fundamental screech tone and its harmonics fairly
well at multiple observer locations in the far-field. Intense jet flapping motions in the near-field
along the minor axis, which are enhanced by jet-to-jet interactions, are found to correspond to
those frequencies. Moreover, the overall sound pressure levels are within 1-2 dB difference from
the experimental measurements. However, the screech tones appear to be intermittent, as the twin-jet
interaction pattern varies irregularly. To extract dominant flow structures at the screech frequencies
and identify the twin-jet coupling modes, spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) analysis
is used. SPOD analysis recovers energetic peaks at the screech frequencies, and the corresponding
leading modes indicate strong upstream radiation originating from the fifth/sixth shock-cells.
For the two over-expanded conditions, the leading modes show anti-symmetric coupling in the minor
axis at the fundamental screech frequencies. In contrast, the two jets behave symmetrically with
respect to each other in the major axis, in line with the absence of jet flapping in this direction.
Furthermore, the leading SPOD eigenvalues turn out to be, at least, two orders of magnitude larger
than higher-order eigenvalues, suggesting potential of reduced-order models for the twin-jet
screech.

In this paper, the interaction between two immiscible fluids with a finite mobility ratio is investigated
numerically within a Hele-Shaw cell. Fingering instabilities initiated at the interface between
a low viscosity fluid and a high viscosity fluid are analysed at varying capillary numbers and mobility
ratios using a finite mobility ratio model. The present work is motivated by the possible development
of interfacial instabilities that can occur in porous media during the process of CO$_2$ sequestration,
but does not pretend to analyse this complex problem. Instead, we present a detailed study of the
analogous problem occurring in a Hele-Shaw cell, giving indications of possible plume patterns
that can develop during the CO$_2$ injection. The numerical scheme utilises a boundary element
method in which the normal velocity at the interface of the two fluids is directly computed through
the evaluation of a hypersingular integral. The boundary integral equation is solved using a Neumann
convergent series with cubic B-Spline boundary discretisation, exhibiting 6th order spatial
convergence. The convergent series allows the long term non-linear dynamics of growing viscous
fingers to be explored accurately and efficiently. Simulations in low mobility ratio regimes reveal
large differences in fingering patterns compared to those predicted by previous high mobility
ratio models. Most significantly, classical finger shielding between competing fingers is inhibited.
Secondary fingers can possess significant velocity, allowing greater interaction with primary
fingers compared to high mobility ratio flows. Eventually, this interaction can lead to base thinning
and the breaking of fingers into separate bubbles.

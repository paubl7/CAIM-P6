The reliable detection of neutrons in a harsh gamma-ray environment is an important aspect of establishing
non-destructive methods for the characterization of spent nuclear fuel. In this study, we present
results from extended in-situ monitoring of detector systems consisting of commercially available
components: EJ-426, a $^6$Li-enriched solid-state scintillator material sensitive to thermal
neutrons, and two different types of Hamamatsu photomultiplier tubes (PMT). Over the period of
eight months, these detectors were operated in close vicinity to spent nuclear fuel stored at the
interim storage facility CLAB, Oskarshamn, Sweden. At the measurement position the detectors
were continuously exposed to an estimated neutron flux of approx. 280 n/s $\cdot$ cm$^2$ and a gamma-ray
dose rate of approx. 6 Sv/h. A trigger-less data acquisition system has been developed that autonomously
records detector signals at regular intervals. Using offline software algorithms, neutron pulses
were identified in the data. Over the entire investigated dose range of up to 35 kGr, the detector
systems were functioning and were delivering detectable neutron signals. Their performance as
measured by the number of identified neutrons degrades down to about 30% of the initial value. Investigations
of the irradiated components suggest that this degradation is a result of reduced optical transparency
of the involved materials as well as a reduction of PMT gain due to the continuous high currents. Increasing
the gain of the PMT through step-ups of the applied high voltage allowed to partially compensate
for this loss in detection sensitivity. The integrated neutron fluence during the measurement
was experimentally verified to be in the order of $5 \cdot 10^9$ n/cm$^2$. This value was derived
from activation measurements on a tantalum foil that accompanied the detector assemblies during
the measurement campaign.

Motivated by low-altitude cusp observations of small-scale (~ 1 km) field-aligned currents (SSFACs)
interpreted as ionospheric Alfv\'en resonator modes, we investigated the effects of Alfv\'en
wave energy deposition on thermospheric upwelling and the formation of air density enhancements
in and near the cusp. Such density enhancements were commonly observed near 400 km altitude by the
CHAMP satellite. They are not predicted by empirical thermosphere models, and they are well-correlated
with the observed SSFACs. A parameterized model for the altitude dependence of the Alfv\'en wave
electric field, constrained by CHAMP data, has been developed and embedded in the Joule heating
module of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere
(CMIT) model. The CMIT model was then used to simulate the geospace response to an interplanetary
stream interaction region (SIR) that swept past Earth on 26-27 March 2003. CMIT diagnostics for
the thermospheric mass density at 400 km altitude show: 1) CMIT without Alfv\'enic Joule heating
usually underestimates CHAMP's orbit-average density; inclusion of Alfv\'enic heating modestly
improves CMIT's orbit-average prediction of the density (by a few %), especially during the more
active periods of the SIR event. 2) The improvement in CMIT's instantaneous density prediction
with Alfv\'enic heating included is more significant (up to 15%) in the vicinity of the cusp heating
region, a feature that the MSIS empirical thermosphere model misses for this event. Thermospheric
density changes of 20-30% caused by the cusp-region Alfv\'enic heating sporadically populate
the polar region through the action of corotation and neutral winds.

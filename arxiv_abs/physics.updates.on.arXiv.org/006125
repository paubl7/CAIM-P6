Upgraded metallurgical grade silicon (UMG-Si) for photovoltaic (PV) solar applications has been
manufactured through the metallurgical route by means of the process developed by Ferrosolar.
In an ambitious mass production test, performed in commercial solar cells and modules production
lines, the silicon was proven to be appropriate for photovoltaics applications (Fornies et al.,
2019 Mass production test of solar cells and modules made of 100% umg silicon. 20.76% record efficiency.
Energies 12), reaching, in a conventional production line, up to 20.76% of solar cell efficiency
with multicrystalline cells made of 100% UMG silicon. In this paper we present more results from
the mentioned massive test. Defect engineering is being applied to improve the bulk lifetime of
the UMG wafers and to guide in the identification of the limiting defects in the material. Moreover,
the modules produced with 100% UMG silicon solar cells were installed together with the modules
produced in the same production line with polysilicon material to assess the degradation of the
UMG silicon when compared to polysilicon. After 24 months of outdoor PV generation, the degradation,
in terms of Performance Ratio at 25C (25PR) diminution, has been the same for both types of modules.
Additionally, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been performed for this UMG silicon and state-of-the-art
Siemens polysilicon to compare the environmental impact of both silicon feedstocks. The results
presented in this paper; chemical analysis of wafers, defect engineering, low degradation, average
efficiency and environmental assessment, lead to a complete study of UMG silicon, confirming its
potential to be used as raw material for PV applications.

The PrandtlPlane aircraft has been recently considered as a possible candidate to foster the ambition
of a greener aviation. Despite the relevant amount of research carried out in the last years, several
aspects of this novel configuration still need further insight to pave the way to future applications.
Among them, the coupled flight-dynamic and aeroelastic response is addressed in this work by means
of a dedicated in-house framework. For the evaluation of the aerodynamic forces, an enhanced Doublet
Lattice Method, able to take into account terms typically neglected by classic formulations, is
employed. First, flight-dynamic aspects are considered, showing how effects of interaction between
Short Period or Dutch Roll with elastic modes remarkably deteriorate the flying qualities. Then,
focus is on the aeroelastic stability of the aircraft. As observed also in previous literature efforts
on this configuration, flutter onset is considerably different when considering the aircraft
being free in the air or fixed in space. Thanks to the adopted formulation it is shown how, for this
PrandtlPlane, the aerodynamic coupling of elastic and rigid modes has a beneficial effect on flutter
onset. However, the different modal properties, consequence of the diverse boundary conditions,
when switching from fixed-in-space to free-flying aircraft, also play a relevant role in determining
the occurrence of flutter. Whereas for the longitudinal case both effects contribute increasing
flutter speed, for the lateral-directional case the variation in modal properties has a detrimental
and dominating effect, leading to a flutter speedwell within the flight envelope.Finally,the
work discusses the contributions of the additional terms modeled by the enhanced Doublet Lattice
Method, showing how they induce a considerable effect when modeling the flight dynamics of the flexible
aircraft.

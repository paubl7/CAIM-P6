A theoretical and experimental analysis is carried out of radiative heat transfer in the coaxial
geometry of evacuated tubular solar collectors, with emphasis on the operation at high temperatures
for industrial process heat. Radiative heat transfer is usually described using the grey body approximation
which strictly does not apply to selective absorber coatings. Also, the outer envelope of a tubular
collector is partially transmitting in the thermal infrared, especially when constructed of borosilicate
glass for durability at high temperatures. We evaluate the likely effect of such transmission by
developing analytic expressions for the heat transfer through the outer glass envelope and show
the equations of heat transfer no longer follow a simple form so that an effective emissivity for
the system as previously used cannot be defined. To test all approximations in practice, an experiment
is performed using an evacuated solar collector manufactured in the 1980s by the Nitto Kohki company
in Japan using the effective emissivity approximation to determine the heat transfer characteristics
in a typical operating conditions using net radiative heat flows both inwards and outwards. The
effective emittance method in practice enabled a good fit to temperature-time data for cooling
and heating of the inner tube. The results confirm that the effective emittance method can be used
in practical situations with typical glass wall thickness, even though there is radiative transfer
through the outer envelope. The work has verified the stability of the vacuum in this type of evacuated
solar collector as the aged tube still functions to a high standard in terms of maintaining a low emissivity
and good level of vacuum after approximately 40 years in storage conditions.

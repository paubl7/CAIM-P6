To evaluate the role of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) on Northern Hemisphere (NH) surface air temperature
trends it is important to have reliable estimates of both quantities. 16 different TSI estimates
were compiled from the literature. 1/2 of these estimates are low variability and 1/2 are high variability.
5 largely-independent methods for estimating NH temperature trends were evaluated using: 1) only
rural weather stations; 2) all available stations whether urban or rural (the standard approach);
3) only sea surface temperatures; 4) tree-ring temperature proxies; 5) glacier length temperature
proxies. The standard estimates using urban as well as rural stations were anomalous as they implied
a much greater warming in recent decades than the other estimates. This suggests urbanization bias
might still be a problem in current global temperature datasets despite the conclusions of some
earlier studies. Still, all 5 estimates confirm it is currently warmer than the late 19th century,
i.e., there has been some global warming since 1850. For the 5 estimates of NH temperatures, the contribution
from direct solar forcing for all 16 estimates of TSI was evaluated using simple linear least-squares
fitting. The role of human activity in recent warming was then calculated by fitting the residuals
to the UN IPCC's recommended anthropogenic forcings time series. For all 5 NH temperature series,
different TSI estimates implied everything from recent global warming being mostly human-caused
to it being mostly natural. It seems previous studies (including the most recent IPCC reports) that
had prematurely concluded the former failed to adequately consider all the relevant estimates
of TSI and/or to satisfactorily address the uncertainties still associated with NH temperature
trend estimates. Several recommendations are provided on how future research could more satisfactorily
resolve these issues.

Clustering of inertial particles is important for many types of astrophysical and geophysical
turbulence, but it has been studied predominately for incompressible flows. Here we study compressible
flows and compare clustering in both compressively (irrotationally) and vortically (solenoidally)
forced turbulence. Vortically and compressively forced flows are driven stochastically either
by solenoidal waves or by circular expansion waves, respectively. For compressively forced flows,
the power spectra of the density of inertial particles are a particularly sensitive tool for displaying
particle clustering relative to the density enhancement. We use both Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions
for the particles. Particle clustering through shock interaction is found to be particularly prominent
in turbulence driven by spherical expansion waves. It manifests itself through a double-peaked
distribution of spectral power as a function of Stokes number. The two peaks are associated with
two distinct clustering mechanisms; shock interaction for smaller Stokes numbers and the centrifugal
sling effect for larger values. The clustering of inertial particles is associated with the formation
of caustics. Such caustics can only be captured in the Lagrangian description, which allows us to
assess the relative importance of caustics in vortically and irrotationally forced turbulence.
We show that the statistical noise resulting from the limited number of particles in the Lagrangian
description can be removed from the particle power spectra, allowing us a more detailed comparison
of the residual spectra. We focus on the Epstein drag law relevant for rarefied gases, but show that
our findings apply also to the usual Stokes drag.

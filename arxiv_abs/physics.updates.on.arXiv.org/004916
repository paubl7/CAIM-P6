This thesis deals with the systematic treatment of quantum-mechanical systems in post-Newtonian
gravitational fields. Starting from clearly spelled-out assumptions, employing a framework
of geometric background structures defining the notion of a post-Newtonian expansion, our systematic
approach allows to properly derive the post-Newtonian coupling of quantum-mechanical systems
to gravity based on first principles. This sets it apart from more heuristic approaches that are
commonly employed, for example, in the description of quantum-optical experiments under gravity.
Regarding single particles, we compare simple canonical quantisation of a free particle in curved
spacetime to formal expansions of the minimally coupled Klein-Gordon equation, which may be motivated
from QFT in curved spacetimes. Specifically, we develop a general WKB-like post-Newtonian expansion
of the KG equation to arbitrary order in $c^{-1}$. Furthermore, for stationary spacetimes, we show
that the Hamiltonians arising from expansions of the KG equation and from canonical quantisation
agree up to linear order in particle momentum, independent of any expansion in $c^{-1}$. Concerning
composite systems, we perform a fully detailed systematic derivation of the first order post-Newtonian
quantum Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of an electromagnetically bound two-particle system
situated in external electromagnetic and gravitational fields, the latter being described by
the Eddington-Robertson PPN metric. In the last, independent part of the thesis, we prove two uniqueness
results characterising the Newton--Wigner position observable for Poincar\'e-invariant classical
Hamiltonian systems: one is a direct classical analogue of the quantum Newton--Wigner theorem,
and the other clarifies the geometric interpretation of the Newton--Wigner position as `centre
of spin', as proposed by Fleming in 1965.

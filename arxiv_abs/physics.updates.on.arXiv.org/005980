Until now, the fabrication of electrocatalysts to guarantee long life of fuel cells and low consumption
of noble metals remains a major challenge. The electrocatalysts based on metals or metal oxides
which are used today are limited by the complexity of their synthesis processes and require several
steps before depositing the catalysts on the substrate. Herein is described a chemical synthesis
process that consists of a single-step synthesis and direct deposition of catalysts nanoparticles
such as gold (Au), palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) in the thickness of a carbon-fibers-based porous
transport layer (PTL). The synthesis process essentially consists of dissolving in the same PGMEA
(Propylene glycol methyl ether acetate) solvent a metal precursor (HAuCl4 or PdNO2 or PtCl4) and
a homopolymer PMMA (Polymethylmetacrylate), then the metal solution is deposited on the surface
of the PTL after cleaning. Special emphasis is made on Pt-based materials. The obtained PTL-supported
nanoparticles were firstly characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate their
morphology, and then X-Ray diffraction (XRD) to observe the crystal phases. To validate the methodology,
Pt-coated PTL materials have been used as anode for the borohydride oxidation reaction (BOR) in
a direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC) and compared to a state-of-the-art nickel electrode. There
is an optimum loading of platinum (below 0.16 mg Pt/cm2) which constitutes the best compromise between
power density and faradic efficiency for the borohydride oxidation reaction (BOR). Thanks to this
low Pt loading, hydrogen evolved during the anodic reaction is completely valorized. These electrodes
combine the advantages of high-performance with a very low metal loading, hence lowering materials
cost.

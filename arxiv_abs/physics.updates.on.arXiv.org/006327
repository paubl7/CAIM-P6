Multicomponent T2-mapping using a gradient and spin-echo (GraSE) acquisition has become standard
for myelin water imaging at 3T. Higher magnetic field strengths promise SNR benefits but face specific
absorption rate limits and shortened T2 times. This study investigates compartmental T2 times
in vivo and addresses advantages and challenges of multi-component T2-mapping at 7T. We acquired
3D multi-echo GraSE data in seven healthy adults at 7T, with three subjects scanned also at 3T. Stimulated
echoes arising from B+1 inhomogeneities were accounted for by the extended phase graph (EPG) algorithm.
We used the computed T2 distributions to determine T2 times that identify different water pools
and assessed signal-to-noise and fit-to-noise characteristics of the signal estimation. We compared
short T2 fractions and T2 properties of the intermediate water pool at 3T and 7T. Flip angle mapping
confirmed that EPG accurately determined the larger inhomogeneity at 7T. Multi-component T2 analysis
demonstrated shortened T2 times at 7T compared to 3T. Fit-to-noise and signal-to-noise ratios
were improved at 7T but depended on B1 homogeneity. Lowering the shortest T2 to 8 ms and adjusting
the T2 threshold that separates different water compartments to 20 ms, yielded short T2 fractions
at 7T that conformed to 3T data. Short T2 fractions in myelin-rich white matter regions were lower
at 7T than at 3T, and higher in iron-rich structures. Adjusting the T2 compartment boundaries was
required due to the shorter T2 relaxation times at 7T. Shorter echo spacing would better sample the
fast decaying signal but would increase peripheral nerve stimulation. We used a multi-echo 3D-GraSE
sequence to characterize the multi-exponential T2 decay at 7T. We adapted T2 parameters for evaluation
of the short T2 fraction. Obtained 7T multicomponent T2-maps were in good agreement with 3T data.

This study sets out to analyze future synergies between the O&G and renewables sectors and explore
how exploiting these synergies could lead to economic and environmental benefits. By firstly reviewing
and highlighting relevant technologies and related projects, this report synthesizes the state
of the art in offshore energy system integration, by focusing on three key technologies in electrification/floating
wind, electrolysis/hydrogen production and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). With a timeframe
out to 2050 and model scope including all North Sea neighbouring countries, this analysis explores
a total of nine future scenarios for the North Sea energy system. The main results include an immediate
electrification of all operational DUC platforms by linking them to the shore and/or a planned Danish
energy island. These measures result in cost and CO2 emissions savings compared to a BAU scenario
of 72% and 85% respectively. When these platforms cease production, this is followed by the repurposing
of the platforms into hydrogen generators with up to 3.6 GW of electrolysers and the development
of up to 5.8 GW of floating wind. The generated hydrogen is assumed to power the future transport sector,
and is delivered to shore in existing and/or new purpose-built pipelines. The contribution of the
O&G sector to this hydrogen production amounts to around 19 TWh, which represents about 2% of total
European hydrogen demand for transport in 2050. The levelized costs (LCOE) of producing this hydrogen
in 2050 are around 4 euro2012/kg H2, which is around twice those expected in similar studies. But
this does not account for energy policies that may incentivize green hydrogen production in the
future, which would serve to reduce this LCOE to a level that is more competitive with other sources.

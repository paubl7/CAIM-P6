MRI-guided radiation treatment planning is widely applied because of its superior soft-tissue
contrast and no ionization radiation compared to CT-based planning. In this regard, synthetic
CT (sCT) images should be generated from the patients MRI scans if radiation treatment planning
is sought. Among the different available methods for this purpose, the deep learning algorithms
have and do outperform their conventional counterparts. In this study, we investigated the performance
of some most popular deep learning architectures including eCNN, U-Net, GAN, V-Net, and Res-Net
for the task of sCT generation. As a baseline, an atlas-based method is implemented to which the results
of the deep learning-based model are compared. A dataset consisting of 20 co-registered MR-CT pairs
of the male pelvis is applied to assess the different sCT production methods' performance. The mean
error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), structural similarity
index (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics were computed between the estimated
sCT and the ground truth (reference) CT images. The visual inspection revealed that the sCTs produced
by eCNN, V-Net, and ResNet, unlike the other methods, were less noisy and greatly resemble the ground
truth CT image. In the whole pelvis region, the eCNN yielded the lowest MAE (26.03-8.85 HU) and ME
(0.82-7.06 HU), and the highest PCC metrics were yielded by the eCNN (0.93-0.05) and ResNet (0.91-0.02)
methods. The ResNet model had the highest PSNR of 29.38-1.75 among all models. In terms of the Dice
similarity coefficient, the eCNN method revealed superior performance in major tissue identification
(air, bone, and soft tissue). All in all, the eCNN and ResNet deep learning methods revealed acceptable
performance with clinically tolerable quantification errors.

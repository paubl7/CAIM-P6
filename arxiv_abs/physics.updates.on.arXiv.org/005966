The Covid-19 pandemic caused disruptive effects for individuals, firms, and societies. In this
paper, we offer insights on the major issues and challenges firms are facing in the Covid-19 pandemic,
as well as their concerns for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) themes. To do so, we investigate
large Italian firms' discussion on Twitter in the first nine months of the pandemic. We downloaded
all Twitter posts from 1st of March, 2020, to 17th of November, 2020 by the accounts of the largest
Italian firms, i.e. those with 250 or more employees. We then built the bipartite network of accounts
and hashtags and, using an entropy-based null model as a benchmark, we projected the information
contained in the network into the accounts layers, identifying a network of accounts in which a link
indicates a non trivial similarity in terms of their usage of hashtags. We find that the conversation
is focused around 13 communities, 10 of which include Covid-19 themes. The core of the network is
formed of 5 communities, which deal with environmental sustainability, digital innovation and
safety. Firms' ownership type does not seem to influence the conversation. 10 communities out of
13 mention hashtags related to CSR, with the environmental and social dimensions as the prevalent
ones. Interestingly enough, the social dimension seems more relevant in the communities dealing
with digital innovation and safety. However, the relevance of CSR hashtags is very small at the single
message level, but with some peculiarities arising in specific communities. Overall, our paper
highlights the role of network methods on Twitter data as a tool which can support managers and policy
makers to design their strategies and decision making, capturing firms' emerging issues and relevant
themes.

It is a well-established principle that cross-correlating seismic observations at different
receiver locations can yield estimates of band-limited inter-receiver Green's functions. This
principle, known as seismic interferometry, is a powerful technique that can transform noise into
signals which allow us to remotely image and interrogate subsurface Earth structures. In practice
it is often necessary and even desirable to rely on noise already present in the environment. Theory
that underpins many applications of ambient noise interferometry makes an assumption that the
noise sources are uncorrelated in space and time. However, many real-world noise sources such as
trains, highway traffic and ocean waves are inherently correlated both in space and time, in direct
contradiction to the current theoretical foundations. Applying standard interferometric techniques
to recordings from correlated energy sources makes the Green's function liable to estimation errors
that so far have not been fully accounted for theoretically nor in practice. We show that these errors
are significant for common noise sources, always perturbing and sometimes obscuring the phase
one wishes to retrieve. Our analysis explains why stacking may reduce the phase errors, but also
shows that in commonly-encountered circumstances stacking will not remediate the problem. This
analytical insight allowed us to develop a novel workflow that significantly mitigates effects
arising from the use of correlated noise sources. Our methodology can be used in conjunction with
already existing approaches, and improves results from both correlated and uncorrelated ambient
noise. Hence, we expect it to be widely applicable in real life ambient noise studies.

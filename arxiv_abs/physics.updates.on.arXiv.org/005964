Many practical combustion systems such as those in rockets, gas turbines, and internal combustion
engines operate under high pressures that surpass the thermodynamic critical limit of fuel-oxidizer
mixtures. These conditions require the consideration of complex fluid behaviors that pose challenges
for numerical simulations, casting doubts on the validity of existing subgrid-scale (SGS) models
in large-eddy simulations of these systems. While data-driven methods have shown high accuracy
as closure models in simulations of turbulent flames, these models are often criticized for lack
of physical interpretability, wherein they provide answers but no insight into their underlying
rationale. The objective of this study is to assess SGS stress models from conventional physics-driven
approaches and an interpretable machine learning algorithm, i.e., the random forest regressor,
in a turbulent transcritical non-premixed flame. To this end, direct numerical simulations (DNS)
of transcritical liquid-oxygen/gaseous-methane (LOX/GCH4) inert and reacting flows are performed.
Using this data, a priori analysis is performed on the Favre-filtered DNS data to examine the accuracy
of physics-based and random forest SGS-models under these conditions. SGS stresses calculated
with the gradient model show good agreement with the exact terms extracted from filtered DNS. The
accuracy of the random-forest regressor decreased when physics-based constraints are applied
to the feature set. Results demonstrate that random forests can perform as effectively as algebraic
models when modeling subgrid stresses, only when trained on a sufficiently representative database.
The employment of random forest feature importance score is shown to provide insight into discovering
subgrid-scale stresses through sparse regression.

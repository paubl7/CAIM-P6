Acoustophoresis deals with the manipulation of sub-wavelength scatterers in an incident acoustic
field. The geometric details of manipulated particles are often neglected by replacing them with
equivalent symmetric geometries such as spheres, spheroids, cylinders or disks. It has been demonstrated
that geometric asymmetry, represented by Willis coupling terms, can strongly affect the scattering
of a small object, hence neglecting these terms may miss important force contributions. In this
work, we present a generalized formalism of acoustic radiation force and radiation torque based
on the polarizability tensor, where Willis coupling terms are included to account for geometric
asymmetry. Following Gorkov's approach, the effects of geometric asymmetry are explicitly formulated
as additional terms in the radiation force and torque expressions. By breaking the symmetry of a
sphere along one axis using intrusion and protrusion, we characterize the changes in the force and
torque in terms of partial components, associated with the direct and Willis Coupling coefficients
of the polarizability tensor. We investigate in detail the cases of standing and travelling plane
waves, showing how the equilibrium positions and angles are shifted by these additional terms.
We show that while the contributions of asymmetry to the force are often negligible for small particles,
these terms greatly affect the radiation torque. Our presented theory, providing a way of calculating
radiation force and torque directly from polarizability coefficients, shows that in general it
is essential to account for shape of objects undergoing acoustophoretic manipulation, and this
may have important implications for applications such as the manipulation of biological cells.

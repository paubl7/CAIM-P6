We present a theory for the self-propulsion of symmetric, half spherical Marangoni boats (soap
or camphor boats) at low Reynolds numbers. Propulsion is generated by release (diffusive emission
or dissolution) of water-soluble surfactant molecules, which modulate the air-water interfacial
tension. Propulsion either requires asymmetric release or spontaneous symmetry breaking by coupling
to advection for a perfectly symmetrical swimmer. We study the diffusion-advection problem for
a sphere in Stokes flow analytically and numerically both for constant concentration and constant
flux boundary conditions. We derive novel results for concentration profiles under constant flux
boundary conditions and for the Nusselt number (the dimensionless ratio of total emitted flux and
diffusive flux). Based on these results, we analyze the Marangoni boat for small Marangoni propulsion
(low Peclet number) and show that two swimming regimes exist, a diffusive regime at low velocities
and an advection-dominated regime at high swimmer velocities. We describe both the limit of large
Marangoni propulsion (high Peclet number) and the effects from evaporation by approximative analytical
theories. The swimming velocity is determined by force balance, and we obtain a general expression
for the Marangoni forces, which comprises both direct Marangoni forces from the surface tension
gradient and Marangoni flow forces. We unravel, whether the Marangoni flow contribution is exerting
a forward or backward force during propulsion. Our main result is the relation between Peclet number
and swimming velocity. Spontaneous symmetry breaking and, thus, swimming occurs for a perfectly
symmetrical swimmer above a critical Peclet number, which becomes small for large system sizes.
We find a supercritical swimming bifurcation for a symmetric swimmer and an avoided bifurcation
in the presence of an asymmetry.

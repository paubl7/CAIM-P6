Now that conventional weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter searches are approaching
the neutrino floor, there has been a resurgence of interest in detectors with sensitivity to nuclear
recoil directions. A large-scale directional detector is attractive in that it would have sensitivity
below the neutrino floor, be capable of unambiguously establishing the galactic origin of a purported
dark matter signal, and could serve a dual purpose as a neutrino observatory. We present the first
detailed analysis of a 1000~m$^3$-scale detector capable of measuring a directional nuclear recoil
signal at low energies. We propose a modular and multi-site observatory consisting of time projection
chambers (TPCs) filled with helium and SF$_6$ at atmospheric pressure. Depending on the TPC readout
technology, 10-20 helium recoils above 6 kevr or only 3-4 recoils above 20~\kevr would suffice to
distinguish a 10~GeV WIMP signal from the solar neutrino background. High-resolution charge readout
also enables powerful electron background rejection capabilities well below 10~keV. We detail
background and site requirements at the 1000~m$^3$-scale, and identify materials that require
improved radiopurity. The final experiment, which we name CYGNUS-1000, will be able to observe
10-40 neutrinos from the Sun, depending on the final energy threshold. With the same exposure, the
sensitivity to spin independent cross sections will extend into presently unexplored sub-10 GeV
parameter space. For spin dependent interactions, already a 10~m$^3$-scale experiment could
compete with upcoming generation-two detectors, but CYGNUS-1000 would improve upon this considerably.
Larger volumes would bring sensitivity to neutrinos from an even wider range of sources, including
galactic supernovae, nuclear reactors, and geological processes.

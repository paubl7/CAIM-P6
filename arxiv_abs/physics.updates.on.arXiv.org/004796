Nanoscale confinement can drastically impact atmospheric ice nucleation. A notable example is
contact freezing in which a collision between a dry ice nucleating particle (INP) and a water droplet
results in considerably faster heterogeneous nucleation. The molecular mechanism of such enhancement
is, however, still a mystery. While earlier studies had attributed it to collision-induced transient
perturbations, recent experiments point to the pivotal role of nanoscale proximity of the INP and
the free interface. By simulating heterogeneous nucleation of ice within INP-supported nanofilms
of two model water-like tetrahedral liquids, we demonstrate that such nanoscale proximity is sufficient
for inducing rate increases commensurate with those observed in contact freezing experiments,
but only if the free interface has a tendency to enhance homogeneous nucleation. Water is suspected
of possessing this latter property, known as surface freezing propensity. Our findings therefore
establish a connection between surface freezing propensity and kinetic enhancement during contact
nucleation. We also observe that faster nucleation proceeds through a mechanism markedly distinct
from classical heterogeneous nucleation, involving the formation of hourglass-shaped crystalline
nuclei that conceive at either interface, and that have a lower free energy of formation due to a synergy
between the interfaces and the modulation of the free interfacial structure by the INP. In addition
to providing valuable insights into the physics of contact nucleation, our findings can assist
in improving the accuracy of heterogeneous nucleation rate measurements in experiments, and in
advancing our understanding of ice nucleation on nonuniform surfaces such as organic, polymeric
and biological materials.

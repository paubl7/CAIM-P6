Human social behavior plays a crucial role in how pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 or fake news spread in
a population. Social interactions determine the contact network among individuals, while spreading,
requiring individual-to-individual transmission, takes place on top of the network. Studying
the topological aspects of a contact network, therefore, not only has the potential of leading to
valuable insights into how the behavior of individuals impacts spreading phenomena, but it may
also open up possibilities for devising effective behavioral interventions. Because of the temporal
nature of interactions - since the topology of the network, containing who is in contact with whom,
when, for how long, and in which precise sequence, varies (rapidly) in time - analyzing them requires
developing network methods and metrics that respect temporal variability, in contrast to those
developed for static (i.e., time-invariant) networks. Here, by means of event mapping, we propose
a method to quantify how quickly agents mingle by transforming temporal network data of agent contacts.
We define a novel measure called 'contact sequence centrality', which quantifies the impact of
an individual on the contact sequences, reflecting the individual's behavioral potential for
spreading. Comparing contact sequence centrality across agents allows for ranking the impact
of agents and identifying potential 'behavioral super-spreaders'. The method is applied to social
interaction data collected at an art fair in Amsterdam. We relate the measure to the existing network
metrics, both temporal and static, and find that (mostly at longer time scales) traditional metrics
lose their resemblance to contact sequence centrality. Our work highlights the importance of accounting
for the sequential nature of contacts when analyzing social interactions.

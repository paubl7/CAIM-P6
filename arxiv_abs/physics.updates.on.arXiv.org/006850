We develop a broadly-applicable computational method for the automatic construction of the multi-channel
bimolecular reaction mechanism. The current methodology mainly involves the high-energy Born-Oppenheimer
molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulation and the successive automatic reaction pathway construction.
Several computational tricks are introduced, which largely save computational cost and significantly
improve calculation convergence for medium-sized compounds. The reactive regions are selected
based on the electronic-structure calculation results. The virtual collision-dynamics simulations
with monitoring atomic distance are performed before BOMD. These prescreening steps largely reduce
the number of trajectories in the BOMD simulations and save a considerable amount of computational
cost. The hidden Markov model combined with modified atomic connectivity matrix is taken for the
detection of reaction events in each BOMD trajectory. Starting from several geometries closed
to reaction events, the further intermediate optimization and transition-state searches are
conducted. The proposed method allows us to build the complicated reaction mechanism of multi-channel
bimolecular reactions for medium-sized compounds automatically. Here we examine the feasibility
and efficiency of the current method by its performance in searching the mechanisms of two prototype
reactions in environmental science, which are the penicillin G anion + H2O and penicillin G anion
+ OH radical reactions. Their complicated multi-channel reaction mechanisms are easily obtained
by using the current method. The result indicates that the proposed theoretical method is a powerful
protocol for the automatic searching of the multi-channel bimolecular reaction mechanisms for
medium-sized compounds.

Most of the power-to-heat and thermal energy storage technologies are mature and already impact
the European energy transition. However, detailed models of these technologies are usually very
complex, making it challenging to implement them in large-scale energy models, where simplicity,
e.g., linearity and appropriate accuracy, are desirable due to computational limitations. In
the literature, the main power-to-heat and thermal energy storage technologies across all sectors
have not been clearly identified and characterized. Their potential roles have not been fully discussed
from the European perspective, and their mathematical modeling equations have not been presented
in a compiled form. This paper contributes to the research gap in three main parts. First, it identifies
and classifies the major power-to-heat and thermal energy storage technologies that are climate-neutral,
efficient, and technologically matured to supplement or substitute the current fossil fuel-based
heating. The second part presents the technology readiness levels of the identified technologies
and discusses their potential role in a sustainable European energy system. The third part presents
the mathematical modeling equations for the technologies in large-scale optimization energy
models. We identified electric heat pumps, electric boilers, electric resistance heaters, and
hybrid heating systems as the most promising power-to-heat options. We grouped the most promising
thermal energy storage technologies under four major categories. Low-temperature electric heat
pumps, electric boilers, electric resistance heaters, and sensible and latent heat storages show
high technology readiness levels to facilitate a large share of the heat demand. Finally, the mathematical
formulations capture the main effects of the identified technologies.

Photothermal spectroscopy and microscopy provides a route to measure the spectral and spatial
properties of individual nanoscopic absorbers, independent from scattering, extinction, and
emission. The approach relies upon use of two light sources, one that resonantly excites and heats
the target and its surrounding environment and a second off-resonant probe that scatters from the
resulting volume of thermally modified refractive index. Over the past twenty years, considerable
effort has been extended to apply photothermal methods to detect, spatially resolve, and perform
absorption spectroscopy on single non-emissive molecules and other absorbers like plasmonic
nanoparticles at room temperature conditions. Companion theoretical models have been developed
to interpret these experimental advances, yet it is not clear how they are related to each other nor
how the effects of lock-in detection modify the theory. For larger target systems that host their
own intrinsic scattering resonances as well as for background media that do not instantaneously
thermalize with the absorbing target, additional dependencies arise that are yet to be explored
theoretically. The aim of this Perspective is to overview the theory of photothermal spectroscopy
and microscopy and present a unifying theoretical approach that recovers past models in certain
limits while explicitly including the effects of target scattering resonances, thermal and optical
retardation, and lock-in detection. Focus is made on plasmonic particles to interpret the photothermal
signal, yet all results are applicable equally to individual molecules or nanoparticle absorbers.
Consequently, we expect this review to provide a useful foundation for the understanding of photothermal
measurements independent of target identity.

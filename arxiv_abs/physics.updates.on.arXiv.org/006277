Resonance is instrumental in modern optics and photonics for novel phenomena such as cavity quantum
electrodynamics and electric-field-induced transparency. While one can use numerical simulations
to sweep geometric and material parameters of optical structures, these simulations usually require
considerably long calculation time (spanning from several hours to several weeks) and substantial
computational resources. Such requirements significantly limit their applicability in understanding
and inverse designing structures with desired resonance performances. Recently, the introduction
of artificial intelligence allows for faster predictions of resonance with less demanding computational
requirements. However, current end-to-end deep learning approaches generally fail to predict
resonances with high quality-factors (Q-factor). Here, we introduce a universal deep learning
strategy that can predict ultra-high Q-factor resonances by decomposing spectra with an adaptive
data acquisition (ADA) method while incorporating resonance information. We exploit bound states
in the continuum (BICs) with an infinite Q-factor to testify this resonance-informed deep learning
(RIDL) strategy. The trained RIDL strategy achieves high-accuracy prediction of reflection spectra
and photonic band structures while using a considerably small training dataset. We further develop
an inverse design algorithm based on the RIDL strategy for a symmetry-protected BIC on a suspended
silicon nitride photonic crystal (PhC) slab. The predicted and measured angle-resolved band structures
show minimum differences. We expect the RIDL strategy to apply to many other physical phenomena
which exhibit Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Fano resonances.

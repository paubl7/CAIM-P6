We investigated changes in the b value of the Gutenberg-Richter's law in and around the focal areas
of earthquakes on March 20 and on May 1, 2021, with magnitude (M) 6.9 and 6.8, respectively, which
occurred off the Pacific coast of Miyagi prefecture, northeastern Japan. We showed that the b value
in these focal areas had been noticeably small, especially within a few years before the occurrence
of the M6.9 earthquake in its vicinity, indicating that differential stress had been high in the
focal areas. The coseismic slip of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake seems to have stopped just short of
the east side of the focus of the M6.9 earthquake. Furthermore, the afterslip of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake
was relatively small in the focal areas of the M6.9 and M6.8 earthquakes, compared to the surrounding
regions. In addition, the focus of the M6.9 earthquake was situated close to the border point where
the interplate slip in the period from 2012 through 2021 has been considerably larger on the northern
side than on the southern side. The high-stress state inferred by the b-value analysis is concordant
with those characteristics of interplate slip events. We found that the M6.8 earthquake on May 1
occurred near an area where the b value remained small, even after the M6.9 quake. The ruptured areas
by the two earthquakes now seem to almost coincide with the small-b-value region that had existed
before their occurrence. The b value on the east side of the focal areas of the M6.9 and M6.8 earthquakes
which corresponds to the eastern part of the source region of the 1978 off-Miyagi prefecture earthquake
was consistently large, while the seismicity enhanced by the two earthquakes also shows a large
b value, implying that stress in the region has not been very high.

Evaluating structural uncertainties associated with seismic imaging and target horizons can
be of critical importance for decision-making related to oil and gas exploration and production.
An important breakthrough for industrial applications has been made with the development of industrial
approaches to velocity model building. We propose an extension of these approaches, sampling an
equi-probable contour of the tomography posterior probability density function (pdf) rather
than the full pdf, and using non-linear slope tomography (rather than standard tomographic migration
velocity analysis as in previous publications). Our approach allows to assess the quality of uncertainty-related
assumptions (linearity and Gaussian hypothesis within the Bayesian theory) and estimate volumetric
migration positioning uncertainties (a generalization of horizon uncertainties), in addition
to the advantages in terms of efficiency. We derive the theoretical concepts underlying this approach
and unify our derivations with those of previous publications. As the method works in the full model
space rather than in a preconditioned model space, we split the analysis into the resolved and unresolved
tomography spaces. We argue that the resolved space uncertainties are to be used in further steps
leading to decision-making and can be related to the output of methods that work in a preconditioned
model space. The unresolved space uncertainties represent a qualitative byproduct specific to
our method, strongly highlighting the most uncertain gross areas, thus useful for QCs. These concepts
are demonstrated on a synthetic data. Complementarily, the industrial viability of the method
is illustrated on two different 3D field datasets.

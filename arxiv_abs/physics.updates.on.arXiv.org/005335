In this study we consider the effect of a horizontal magnetic field on the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection
in a finite liquid metal layer contained in a cuboid vessel (200 \times 200 \times 40 mm^3). Laboratory
experiments are performed for measuring temperature and flow field in the alloy GaInSn at Prandtl
number Pr = 0.03 and in a Rayleigh number range 2.3 \times 10^4 < Ra < 2.6 \times 10^5. The field strength
is varied up to a maximum value of 320 mT (Ha = 2470, Q = 6.11 \times 10^6). The magnetic field forces
the flow to form two-dimensional rolls parallel to the direction of the field lines. The experiments
confirm the predictions made by Busse and Clever (J. M\'ecanique Th\'eorique et Appliqu\'ee, 1983)
who showed that the application of the horizontal magnetic field extends the range in which steady
two-dimensional roll structures exist (Busse balloon) towards higher Ra numbers. A transition
from the steady to a time-dependent oscillatory flow occurs when Ra exceeds a critical value for
a given Chandrasekhar number Q, which is also equivalent to a reduction of the ratio Q/Ra. Our measurements
reveal that the first developing oscillations are clearly of two-dimensional nature, in particular
a mutual increase and decrease in the size of adjacent convection rolls is observed without the formation
of any detectable gradients in the velocity field along the magnetic field direction. At a ratio
of Q/Ra = 1, the first 3D structures appear, which initially manifest themselves in a slight inclination
of the rolls with respect to the magnetic field direction. Immediately in the course of this, there
arise also disturbances in the spaces between adjacent convection rolls, which are advected along
the rolls due to the secondary flow driven by Ekman pumping. The transition to fully-developed three-dimensional
structures and then to a turbulent regime takes place with further lowering Q/Ra.

Escaping of the liquid molecules from their liquid bulk into the vapour phase at the vapour-liquid
interface is controlled by the vapour diffusion process, which nevertheless hardly senses the
macroscopic shape of this interface. Here, deformed sessile drops due to gravity and surface tension
with various interfacial profiles are realised by tilting flat substrates. The symmetry broken
of the sessile drop geometry leads to a different evaporation behavior compared to a drop with a symmetric
cap on a horizontal substrate. Rather than the vapour-diffusion mechanism, heat-diffusion regime
is defined here to calculate the local evaporation flux along the deformed drop interface. A local
heat resistance, characterised by the liquid layer thickness perpendicular to the substrate,
is proposed to relate the local evaporation flux. We find that the drops with and without deformation
evaporate with a minimum flux at the drop apex, while up to a maximum one with a significantly larger
but finite value at the contact line. Counterintuitively, the deviation from the symmetric shape
due to the deformation on a slope, surprisingly enhances the total evaporation rate; and the smaller
contact angle, the more significant enhancement. Larger tilt quickens the overall evaporation
process and induces a more heterogeneous distribution of evaporative flux under gravity. Interestingly,
with this concept of heat flux, an intrinsic heat resistance is conceivable around the contact line,
which naturally removes the singularity of the evaporation flux showing in the vapour-diffusion
model. The detailed non-uniform evaporation flux suggests ways to control the self-assembly,
microstructures of deposit with engineering applications particularly in three dimensional
printing where drying on slopes is inevitable.

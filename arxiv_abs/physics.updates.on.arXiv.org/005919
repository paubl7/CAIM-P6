Elastic metamaterials may exhibit band gaps at wavelengths far exceeding feature sizes. This is
attributed to local resonances of embedded or branching substructures. In branched configurations,
such as a pillared plate, waves propagating in the base medium-e.g., the plate portion-experience
attenuation at band-gap frequencies. Considering a simplified lumped-parameter model for a branched
medium, we present a theoretical treatment for a periodic unit cell comprising a base mass-spring
chain with a multi-degree-of-freedom, mono-coupled branch. Bloch's theorem is applied, combined
with a sub-structuring approach where the resonating branch is modelled separately and condensed
into its effective dynamic stiffness. Thus, the treatment is generally applicable to an arbitrary
branch regardless of its size and properties. We provide an analysis-with guiding graphical illustrations-that
yields an identification of fundamental bounds for the band-gap edges as dictated by the dynamical
characteristics of the branch. Analytical sensitivity functions are also derived for the dependence
of these bounds on the degree of coupling between the base and the branch. The sensitivity analysis
reveals further novel findings including the role of the frequency derivative of the branch dynamic
stiffness in providing a direct relation between the band-gap edge locations and variation in the
coupling parameters-the mass and stiffness ratios between the base chain and the branch root. In
additional analysis, sub-Bragg bounds of an exact model comprising a one-dimensional (1D) continuous
base-modelled as a rod-and a discrete branch are derived and shown to be tighter than those of the
all-discrete model. Finally, the applicability of the derived bounds and sensitivity functions
are shown to be valid for a corresponding full 2D finite-element model of a pillared waveguide admitting
out-of-plane shear waves.

This study suggests a stochastic model for time series of daily-zonal (circumpolar) mean stratospheric
temperature at a given pressure level. It can be seen as an extension of previous studies which have
developed stochastic models for surface temperatures. The proposed model is a sum of a deterministic
seasonality function and a L\'evy-driven multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which
is a mean-reverting stochastic process. More specifically, the deseasonalized temperature model
is an order 4 continuous time autoregressive model, meaning that the stratospheric temperature
is modeled to be directly dependent on the temperature over four preceding days, while the model's
longer-range memory stems from its recursive nature. This study is based on temperature data from
the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim reanalysis model product.
The residuals of the autoregressive model are well-represented by normal inverse Gaussian distributed
random variables scaled with a time-dependent volatility function. A monthly variability in speed
of mean reversion of stratospheric temperature is found, hence suggesting a generalization of
the 4th order continuous time autoregressive model. A stochastic stratospheric temperature model,
as proposed in this paper, can be used in geophysical analyses to improve the understanding of stratospheric
dynamics. In particular, such characterizations of stratospheric temperature may be a step towards
greater insight in modeling and prediction of large-scale middle atmospheric events, such as for
example sudden stratospheric warmings. Through stratosphere-troposphere coupling, the stratosphere
is hence a source of extended tropospheric predictability at weekly to monthly timescales, which
is of great importance in several societal and industry sectors.

Geothermal heat, as renewable energy, shows great advantage with respect to its environmental
impact due to its significantly lower CO2 emissions than conventional fossil fuel. Open and closed-loop
geothermal heat pumps, which utilize shallow geothermal systems, are an efficient technology
for cooling and heating buildings, especially in urban areas. Integrated use of geothermal energy
technologies for district heating, cooling, and thermal energy storage can be applied to optimize
the subsurface for communities to provide them with multiple sustainable energy and community
resilience benefits. The utilization of the subsurface resources may lead to a variation in the
underground environment, which might further impact local environmental conditions. However,
very few simulators can handle such a highly complex set of coupled computations on a regional or
city scale. We have developed high-performance computing (HPC) based hydrothermal finite element
(FE) simulator that can simulate the subsurface and its hydrothermal conditions at a scale of tens
of km. The HPC simulator enables us to investigate the subsurface thermal and hydrologic response
to the built underground environment (such as basements and subways) at the community scale. In
this study, a coupled hydrothermal simulator is developed based on the open-source finite element
library deal.II. The HPC simulator was validated by comparing the results of a benchmark case study
against COMSOL Multiphysics, in which Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) is modeled and a process
of heat injection into ATES is simulated. The use of an energy pile system at the Treasure Island redevelopment
site (San Francisco, CA, USA) was selected as a case study to demonstrate the HPC capability of the
developed simulator. The simulator is capable of modeling multiple city-scale geothermal scenarios
in a reasonable amount of time.

In this paper, we present an analysis of the guided circumferential elastic waves in soft EA tube
actuators, which has potential applications in the in-situ non-destructive evaluation or online
structural health monitoring (SHM) to detect structural defects or fatigue cracks in soft EA tube
actuators and in the self-sensing of soft EA tube actuators based on the concept of guided circumferential
elastic waves. Both circumferential SH and Lamb-type waves in an incompressible soft EA cylindrical
tube under inhomogeneous biasing fields are considered. The biasing fields, induced by the application
of an electric voltage difference to the electrodes on the inner and outer cylindrical surfaces
of the EA tube in addition to an axial pre-stretch, are inhomogeneous in the radial direction. Dorfmann
and Ogden's theory of nonlinear electroelasticity and the associated linear theory for small incremental
motion constitute the basis of our analysis. By means of the state-space formalism for the incremental
wave motion along with the approximate laminate technique, dispersion relations are derived in
a particularly efficient way. For a neo-Hookean ideal dielectric model, the proposed approach
is first validated numerically. Numerical examples are then given to show that the guided circumferential
wave propagation characteristics are significantly affected by the inhomogeneous biasing fields
and the geometrical parameters. Some particular phenomena such as the frequency veering and the
nonlinear dependence of the phase velocity on the radial electric voltage are discussed. Our numerical
findings demonstrate that it is feasible to use guided circumferential elastic waves for the ultrasonic
non-destructive online SHM to detect interior structural defects or fatigue cracks and for the
self-sensing of the actual state of the soft EA tube actuator.

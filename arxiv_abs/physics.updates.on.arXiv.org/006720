Color Doppler by transthoracic echocardiography creates 2-D fan-shaped maps of blood velocities
in the cardiac cavities. It is a one-component velocimetric technique since it only returns the
velocity components parallel to the ultrasound beams. Intraventricular vector flow mapping (iVFM)
is a method to recover the blood velocity vectors from the Doppler scalar fields in an echocardiographic
three-chamber view. We improved our iVFM numerical scheme by imposing physical constraints. The
iVFM consisted in minimizing regularized Doppler residuals subject to the condition that two fluid-dynamics
constraints were satisfied, namely planar mass conservation, and free-slip boundary conditions.
The optimization problem was solved by using the Lagrange multiplier method. A finite-difference
discretization of the optimization problem, written in the polar coordinate system centered on
the cardiac ultrasound probe, led to a sparse linear system. The single regularization parameter
was determined automatically for non-supervision considerations. The physics-constrained
method was validated using realistic intracardiac flow data from a patient-specific CFD model.
The numerical evaluations showed that the iVFM-derived velocity vectors were in very good agreement
with the CFD-based original velocities, with relative errors ranged between 0.3 and 12%. We calculated
two macroscopic measures of flow in the cardiac region of interest, the mean vorticity and mean stream
function, and observed an excellent concordance between physics-constrained iVFM and CFD. The
capability of physics-constrained iVFM was finally tested with in vivo color Doppler data acquired
in patients routinely examined in the echocardiographic laboratory. The vortex that forms during
the rapid filling was deciphered. The physics-constrained iVFM algorithm is ready for routine
clinical examination.

Characterizing metastable neural dynamics in finite-size spiking networks remains a daunting
challenge. We have recently proposed to address this challenge in the simplifying replica-mean-field
(RMF) limit. In this limit, networks are made of infinitely many replicas of the finite network of
interest, but with randomized interactions across replica. Such randomization renders certain
excitatory networks fully tractable at the cost of neglecting activity correlations, but with
explicit dependence on the finite size of the neural constituents. Unfortunately, realistic metastable
dynamics typically unfold in networks with mixed inhibition and excitation. To address this point,
we extend the RMF computational framework to neural networks modeled by point processes with exponential
stochastic intensities. Within this framework, we show that metastable finite-size networks
admit multistable RMF limits, which are fully characterized by stationary firing rates. Technically,
these stationary rates are determined as solutions to a set of delayed differential equations under
certain regularity conditions that any physical solutions shall satisfy. We solve this original
singular-perturbation problem by adapting the resolvent formalism to our delayed setting. Importantly,
we find that these rates specify probabilistic pseudo-equilibria which accurately capture the
neural variability observed in the original finite-size network. We also perform the analysis
of the stochastic bifurcation of a bistable neural network in terms of static phase transition of
its RMF limits. In turn, we expect to leverage the static picture of RMF limit to infer purely dynamical
features of metastable, finite-size networks, such as transition rates.

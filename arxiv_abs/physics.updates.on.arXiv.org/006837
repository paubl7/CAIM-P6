Human factors, specifically visual impact and noise production, are the current main limitations
for broader urban wind energy exploitation. Trailing edge noise, caused by the turbulent boundary
layer interacting with the airfoil surface, is the primary source of noise of modern horizontal
and vertical axis wind turbines. Low inflow turbulence levels do not affect the trailing edge noise.
However, an inflow of high turbulence intensity has flow structures that can penetrate the boundary
layer, increasing the velocity fluctuations inside the boundary layer and, consequently, the
wall pressure fluctuations and trailing edge noise. This research investigates the effect of high
free-stream turbulence, observed in the atmospheric boundary layer of urban zones, in the trailing
edge noise generation. This was performed by measuring the increment of the turbulence inside of
the boundary layer and surface pressure fluctuations near the trailing edge when an airfoil is submitted
to high inflow turbulence. Experimental measurements were performed in the Aeroacoustic Wind
Tunnel of the University of Twente on a NACA 0012 airfoil subjected to a turbulent inflow. The chord-based
Reynolds number of the experiments ranged from 170 x 10^3 to 500 x 10^3. Results showed that high inflow
turbulence significantly increases the velocity fluctuations and the integral length scale along
the entire boundary layer, resulting in an increment of the surface pressure spectrum more than
6 dB and 10 dB in the entire frequency range for 10% and 20% of free-stream turbulence, respectively.
The 10% free-stream turbulence increases the velocity fluctuations just in the low--frequency
range, whereas the 20% inflow turbulence influences the velocity spectrum in the entire frequency
range, increasing the size of the smallest structures of the turbulence. Amiet's theory is applied
to predict the trailing edge far-field noise.

Traffic networks have been proved to be fractal systems. However, previous studies mainly focused
on monofractal networks, while complex systems are of multifractal structure. This paper is devoted
to exploring the general regularities of multifractal scaling processes in the street network
of 12 Chinese cities. The city clustering algorithm is employed to identify urban boundaries for
defining comparable study areas; box-counting method and the direct determination method are
utilized to extract spatial data; the least squares calculation is employed to estimate the global
and local multifractal parameters. The results showed multifractal structure of urban street
networks. The global multifractal dimension spectrums are inverse S-shaped curves, while the
local singularity spectrums are asymmetric unimodal curves. If the moment order q approaches negative
infinity, the generalized correlation dimension will seriously exceed the embedding space dimension
2, and the local fractal dimension curve displays an abnormal decrease for most cities. The scaling
relation of local fractal dimension gradually breaks if the q value is too high, but the different
levels of the network always keep the scaling reflecting singularity exponent. The main conclusions
are as follows. First, urban street networks follow multifractal scaling law, and scaling precedes
local fractal structure. Second, the patterns of traffic networks take on characteristics of spatial
concentration, but they also show the implied trend of spatial deconcentration. Third, the development
space of central area and network intensive areas is limited, while the fringe zone and network sparse
areas show the phenomenon of disordered evolution. This work may be revealing for understanding
and further research on complex spatial networks by using multifractal theory.

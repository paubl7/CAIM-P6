All-sky observations of the Milky Way show both Galactic and non-Galactic diffuse emission, for
example from interstellar matter or the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The different emitters
are partly superimposed in the measurements, partly they obscure each other, and sometimes they
dominate within a certain spectral range. The decomposition of the underlying radiative components
from spectral data is a signal reconstruction problem and often associated with detailed physical
modeling and substantial computational effort. We aim to build an effective and self-instructing
algorithm detecting the essential spectral information contained Galactic all-sky data covering
spectral bands from $\gamma$-ray to radio waves. Utilizing principles from information theory,
we develop a state-of-the-art variational autoencoder specialized on the adaption to Gaussian
noise statistics. We first derive a generic generative process that leads from a low-dimensional
set of emission features to the observed high-dimensional data. We formulate a posterior distribution
of these features using Bayesian methods and approximate this posterior with variational inference.
The algorithm efficiently encodes the information of 35 Galactic emission data sets in ten latent
feature maps. These contain the essential information required to reconstruct the initial data
with high fidelity and are ranked by the algorithm according to their significance for data regeneration.
The three most significant feature maps encode astrophysical components: (1) The dense interstellar
medium (ISM), (2) the hot and dilute regions of the ISM and (3) the CMB. The machine-assisted and data-driven
dimensionality reduction of spectral data is able to uncover the physical features encoding the
input data. Our algorithm is able to extract the dense and dilute Galactic regions, as well as the
CMB, from the sky brightness values only.

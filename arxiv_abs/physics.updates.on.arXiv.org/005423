For many geophysical measurements, such as direct current or electromagnetic induction methods,
information fades away with depth. This has to be taken into account when interpreting models estimated
from such measurements. For that reason, a measurement sensitivity analysis and determining the
depth of investigation are standard steps during geophysical data processing. In deterministic
gradient-based inversion, the most used sensitivity measure, the differential sensitivity,
is readily available since these inversions require the computation of Jacobian matrices. In contrast,
differential sensitivity may not be readily available in Monte Carlo inversion methods, since
these methods do not necessarily include a linearization of the forward problem. Instead, a prior
ensemble is used to simulate an ensemble of forward responses. Then, the prior ensemble is updated
according to Bayesian inference. We propose to use the covariance between the prior ensemble and
the forward response ensemble for constructing sensitivity measures. In Monte Carlo approaches,
the estimation of this covariance does not require additional computations of the forward model.
Normalizing this covariance by the variance of the prior ensemble, one obtains a simplied regression
coefficient. We investigate differences between this simplified regression coefficient and
differential sensitivity using simple forward models. For linear forward models, the simplied
regression coefficient is equal to differential sensitivity, except for the influences of the
sampling error and of the correlation structure of the prior distribution. In the non-linear case,
the behaviour of the simplified regression coefficient as sensitivity measure is analysed for
a simple non-linear forward model and a frequency-domain electromagnetic forward model. [...]

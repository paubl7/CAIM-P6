The flexibility and stiffness of small DNA play a fundamental role ranging from several biophysical
processes to nano-technological applications. Here, we estimate the mechanical properties of
short double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) having length ranging from 12 base-pairs (bps) to 56 bps, paranemic
crossover (PX) DNA, and hexagonal DNA nanotubes (DNTs) using two widely used coarse-grain models
$-$ Martini and oxDNA. To calculate the persistence length ($L_p$) and the stretch modulus ($\gamma$)
of the dsDNA, we incorporate the worm-like chain and elastic rod model, while for DNT, we implement
our previously developed theoretical framework. We compare and contrast all the results with previously
reported all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and experimental results. The mechanical
properties of dsDNA ($L_p$ $\sim$ 50nm, $\gamma \sim$ 800-1500 pN), PX DNA ($\gamma \sim$ 1600-2000
pN) and DNTs ($L_p \sim 1-10\ \mu$m, $\gamma \sim$ 6000-8000 pN) estimated using Martini soft elastic
network and oxDNA are in very good agreement with the all-atom MD and experimental values, while
the stiff elastic network Martini reproduces order of magnitude higher values of $L_p$ and $\gamma$.
The high flexibility of small dsDNA is also depicted in our calculations. However, Martini models
proved inadequate to capture the salt concentration effects on the mechanical properties with
increasing salt molarity. OxDNA captures the salt concentration effect on small dsDNA mechanics.
But it is found to be ineffective to reproduce the salt-dependent mechanical properties of DNTs.
Also, unlike Martini, the time evolved PX DNA and DNT structures from the oxDNA models are comparable
to the all-atom MD simulated structures. Our findings provide a route to study the mechanical properties
of DNA nanostructures with increased time and length scales and has a remarkable implication in
the context of DNA nanotechnology.

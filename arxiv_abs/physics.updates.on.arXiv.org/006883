In recent years, new functionality and unprecedented wavefront control has been enabled by the
introduction of bianisotropic metasurfaces. A bianisotropic metasurface is characterized by
an electric response, a magnetic response, and an electromagnetic/magnetoelectric response.
In general, these metasurfaces consists of an array of metallic or dielectric particles located
within a subwavelength thick host medium, and are approximated and modelled as infinitely thin,
idealized sheet boundaries defined along a surface. An appropriate sheet boundary condition which
effectively models the tangential field discontinuity due to the array of magnetoelectric inclusions
is the Generalized Sheet Transition Condition or GSTC. Several forms of the GSTC appear in literature.
Here, we present each interpretation and show how they are related. Synthesis approaches unique
to each form are overviewed. By utilizing the GSTC in metasurface design, new possibilities emerge
which are not possible with conventional design techniques incorporating only electric or only
magnetic responses. Since the metasurfaces are designed using bianisotropic boundary conditions,
they must be realized using particles which contain magnetoelectric responses. This review article
discusses the design of metasurfaces using the GSTC, and the bianisotropic particles used to realize
the GSTC. Further, it discusses new and recent applications that have emerged due to bianisotropy,
and future prospects in metasurface design using bianisotropic boundary conditions. The intent
is to provide a comprehensive overview of metasurface design involving bianisotropy and for this
review article to serve as a starting point for engineers and scientist that wish to introduce bianisotropy
into metasurface design.

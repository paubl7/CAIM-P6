We study the effect of impermeable boundaries on the symmetry properties of a random passive scalar
field advected by random flows. We focus on a broad class of nonlinear shear flows multiplied by a
stationary, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) time varying process, including some of their limiting cases,
such as Gaussian white noise or plug flows. For the former case with linear shear, recent studies
\cite{camassa2019symmetry} numerically demonstrated that the decaying passive scalar's long
time limiting probability distribution function (PDF) could be negatively skewed in the presence
of impermeable channel boundaries, in contrast to rigorous results in free space which established
the limiting PDF is positively skewed \cite{mclaughlin1996explicit}. Here, the role of boundaries
in setting the long time limiting skewness of the PDF is established rigorously for the above class
using the long time asymptotic expansion of the $N$-point correlator of the random field obtained
from the ground state eigenvalue perturbation approach proposed in \cite{bronski1997scalar}.
Our analytical result verifies the conclusion for the linear shear flow obtained from numerical
simulations in \cite{camassa2019symmetry}. Moreover, we demonstrate that the limiting distribution
is negatively skewed for any shear flow at sufficiently low P\'eclet number. We show that the long
time limit of the first three moments depends explicitly on the value of $\gamma$, which is in contrast
to the conclusion in \cite{vanden2001non} for the limiting PDF in free space. We derive the exact
formula of the $N$-point correlator for a flow with no spatial dependence and Gaussian temporal
fluctuation, generalizing the results of \cite{bronski2007explicit}. The long time analysis
of this formula is consistent with our theory for a general shear flow. All results are verified by
Monte-Carlo simulations.

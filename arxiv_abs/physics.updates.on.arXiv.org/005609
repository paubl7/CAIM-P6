Bus systems involve complex bus-bus and bus-passengers interactions. We study the problem of assigning
buses to bus stops to minimise the average waiting time of passengers, W. An analytical theory for
two specific cases of interactions is formulated: normal situation where all buses board passengers
from every bus stop, versus novel express buses where disjoint subsets of non-interacting buses
serve disjoint subsets of bus stops. Our formulation allows exact calculation of W for general loops
in the two cases examined. Compared with regular buses, we present scenarios where express buses
show improvement in W. Useful insights are obtained from our theory: 1) there is a minimum number
of buses needed, 2) splitting a crowded bus stop into two less crowded ones always increases W for
regular buses, 3) changing the destination of passengers and location of bus stops do not influence
W. In the second part, we introduce a reinforcement-learning platform that overcomes limitations
of our analytical method to search for better allocations of buses to bus stops that minimise W. Compared
with the previous cases, any possible interaction between buses is allowed, unlocking novel emergent
strategies. We apply this tool to a simple toy model and three empirically-motivated bus loops,
based on data collected from the Nanyang Technological University shuttle bus system. In the simplified
model, we observe an unexpected strategy emerging that could not be analysed with our mathematical
formulation and displays chaotic behaviour. The possible configurations in the three empirically-motivated
scenarios are approximately 10^11, 10^11 and 10^20, so a brute-force approach is impossible. Our
algorithm reduces W by 12% to 32% compared with regular buses and 12% to 29% compared with express
buses. This tool has practical applications because it works independently of the specific characteristics
of a bus loop.

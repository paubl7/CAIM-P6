Developing MgO-bonded castables is still an important subject for refractory producers and end-users
based on the expansive character of the in-situ Mg(OH)2 formation. Considering that magnesia undergoes
hydration when exposed to water and the generated hydrated phase needs to be properly accommodated
in the resulting microstructure to inhibit the generation of cracks, it is very important to find
out alternatives to control the MgO hydration reaction rate. This research investigated the use
of aluminum lactate (AL) as a likely additive to change the hydration and drying behavior of vibratable
castables bonded with different MgO sources (dead burnt, caustic or fumed one). Firstly, XRD, TG
and DSC measurements of magnesia-based aqueous suspensions were evaluated to identify the AL effect
on changing the hydration reaction products during the curing and drying steps. After that, Al2O3-MgO
refractories were prepared and their flowability, curing behavior, cold flexural strength, apparent
porosity, permeability and explosion resistance were evaluated. The results indicated that,
instead of Mg(OH)2, Mg6Al2(OH)16(OH)2.4.5H2O/ Mg6Al2(OH)16(CO3).4H2O was the main hydrated
phase identified in the AL-containing compositions. Due to this change in the hydration behavior
of the refractories, the mixtures prepared with dead-burnt or magnesia fumes plus organic salt
presented a longer setting time. Besides that, crack-free samples with improved permeability
and green mechanical strength could be obtained when adding 0.5 wt.% or 1.0 wt.% of aluminum lactate
to the tested castable compositions. Consequently, 1.0 wt.% of the selected additive favored the
design of refractories with enhanced properties and greater spalling resistance, as no explosion
could be observed even when subjecting the prepared samples to severe heating conditions (20C/min).

Propagation of weakly stretched spherical flames in partially pre-vaporized fuel sprays is theoretically
investigated in this work. A general theory is developed to describe flame propagation speed, flame
temperature, droplet evaporation onset and completion locations. The influences of liquid fuel
and gas mixture properties on spherical spray flame propagation are studied. The results indicate
that the spray flame propagation speed is enhanced with increased droplet mass loading and/or evaporation
heat exchange coefficient (or evaporation rate). Opposite trends are found when the latent heat
is high, due to strong evaporation heat absorption. Fuel vapor and temperature gradients are observed
in the post-flame evaporation zone of heterogeneous flames. Evaporation completion front location
considerably changes with flame radius, but the evaporation onset location varies little relative
to the flame front when the flame propagates. For larger droplet loading and smaller evaporation
rate, the fuel droplet tends to complete evaporation behind the flame front. Flame bifurcation
occurs with high droplet mass loading under large latent heat, leading to multiplicity of flame
propagation speed, droplet evaporation onset and completion fronts. The flame enhancement or
weakening effects by the fuel droplet sprays are revealed by enhanced or suppressed heat and mass
diffusion process in the pre-flame zone. Besides, for heterogeneous flames, heat and mass diffusion
in the post-flame zone also exists. The mass diffusion for both homogeneous and heterogeneous flames
is enhanced with decreased Lewis number. The magnitude of Markstein length is considerably reduced
with increased droplet loading. Moreover, post-flame droplet burning behind heterogeneous flame
influences the flame propagation speed and Markstein length when the liquid fuel loading is relatively
low.

Understanding influencing factors is essential for the surveillance and prevention of infectious
diseases, and the factors are likely to vary spatially and temporally as the disease progresses.
Taking daily cases and deaths data during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the
U.S. as a case study, we develop a mobility-augmented geographically and temporally weighted regression
(M-GTWR) model to quantify the spatiotemporal impacts of social-demographic factors and human
activities on the COVID-19 dynamics. Different from the base GTWR model, we incorporate a mobility-adjusted
distance weight matrix where travel mobility is used in addition to the spatial adjacency to capture
the correlations among local observations. The model residuals suggest that the proposed model
achieves a substantial improvement over other benchmark methods in addressing the spatiotemporal
nonstationarity. Our results reveal that the impacts of social-demographic and human activity
variables present significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In particular, a 1% increase in
population density may lead to 0.63% and 0.71% more daily cases and deaths, and a 1% increase in the
mean commuting time may result in 0.22% and 0.95% increases in daily cases and deaths. Although increased
human activities will, in general, intensify the disease outbreak, we report that the effects of
grocery and pharmacy-related activities are insignificant in areas with high population density.
And activities at the workplace and public transit are found to either increase or decrease the number
of cases and deaths, depending on particular locations. The results of our study establish a quantitative
framework for identifying influencing factors during a disease outbreak, and the obtained insights
may have significant implications in guiding the policy-making against infectious diseases.

An articulated body is defined as a finite number of rigid bodies connected by a set of arbitrary constraints
that limit the relative motion between pairs of bodies. Such a general definition encompasses a
wide variety of situations in the microscopic world, from bacteria to synthetic micro-swimmers,
but it is also encountered when discretizing inextensible bodies, such as filaments or membranes.
Simulating suspensions of such articulated bodies requires to solve the hydrodynamic interactions
between large collections of objects of arbitrary shape while satisfying the multiple constraints
that connect them. Two main challenges arise in this task: limiting the cost of the hydrodynamic
solves, and enforcing the constraints within machine precision at each time-step. To address these
challenges we propose a formalism that combines the body mobility problem in Stokes flow with a velocity
formulation of the constraints, resulting in a mixed mobility-resistance problem. While resistance
problems are known to scale poorly with the particle number, our preconditioned iterative solver
is not sensitive to the system size. Constraint violations, e.g. due to discrete time-integration
errors, are prevented by correcting the particles' positions and orientations at the end of each
time-step. Our correction procedure, based on a nonlinear minimisation algorithm, is negligible
in terms of computational cost and preserves the accuracy of the time-integration scheme. We showcase
the robustness and scalability of our method by exploring the locomotion modes of a model microswimmer
inspired by the diatom colony Bacillaria Paxillifer, and by simulating large suspensions of bacteria
interacting near a no-slip boundary. Finally, we provide a Python implementation of our framework
in a collaborative publicly available code.

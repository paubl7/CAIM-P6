Terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs) are very short bursts of gamma radiation associated to thunderstorm
activity and are the manifestation of the highest-energy natural particle acceleration phenomena
occurring on Earth. Photon energies up to several tens of megaelectronvolts are expected, but the
actual upper limit and high-energy spectral shape are still open questions. Results published
in 2011 by the AGILE team proposed a high-energy component in TGF spectra extended up to $\approx$100
MeV, which is difficult to reconcile with the predictions from the Relativistic Runaway Electron
Avalanche (RREA) mechanism at the basis of many TGF production models. Here we present a new set of
TGFs detected by the AGILE satellite and associated to lightning measurements capable to solve
this controversy. Detailed end-to-end Monte Carlo simulations and an improved understanding
of the instrument performance under high-flux conditions show that it is possible to explain the
observed high-energy counts by a standard RREA spectrum at the source, provided that the TGF is sufficiently
bright and short. We investigate the possibility that single high-energy counts may be the signature
of a fine-pulsed time structure of TGFs on time scales $\approx$4 {\mu}s, but we find no clear evidence
for this. The presented data set and modeling results allow also for explaining the observed TGF
distribution in the (Fluence x duration) parameter space and suggest that the AGILE TGF detection
rate can almost be doubled. Terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs) are very short bursts of gamma radiation
associated to thunderstorm activity and are the manifestation of the highest-energy natural particle

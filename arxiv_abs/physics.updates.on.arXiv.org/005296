Diffractometric biosensing is a promising technology to overcome critical limitations of refractometric
biosensors, the dominant class of label-free optical transducers. These limitations manifest
themselves by higher noise and drifts due to insufficient rejection of refractive index fluctuations
caused by variation in temperature, solvent concentration, and most prominently, non-specific
binding. Diffractometric biosensors overcome these limitations with inherent self-referencing
on the submicron scale with no compromise on resolution. Despite this highly promising attribute,
the field of diffractometric biosensors has only received limited recognition. A major reason
is the lack of a general quantitative analysis. This hinders comparison to other techniques and
amongst different diffractometric biosensors. For refractometric biosensors, on the other hand,
such a comparison is possible by means of the refractive index unit (RIU). In this publication, we
suggest the coherent surface mass density, $\Gamma_{\rm{coh}}$, as a quantity for label-free
diffractometric biosensors with the same purpose as RIU in refractometric sensors. It is easy to
translate $\Gamma_{\rm{coh}}$ to the total surface mass density $\Gamma_{\rm{tot}}$, which
is an important parameter for many assays. We provide a generalized framework to determine $\Gamma_{\rm{coh}}$
for various diffractometric biosensing arrangements which enables quantitative comparison.
Additionally, the formalism can be used to estimate background scattering in order to further optimize
sensor configurations. Finally, a practical guide with important experimental considerations
is given to enable readers of any background to apply the theory. Therefore, this paper provides
a powerful tool for the development of diffractometric biosensors and will help the field to mature
and unveil its full potential.

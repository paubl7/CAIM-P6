The PANS equations model is used to predict the transitional Taylor-Green vortex (TGV) flow at Re=3000.
A new form of the closure is proposed, in which the PANS procedure is applied to a variant of the BHR
turbulence model. The TGV is a benchmark case for transitional flows in which the onset of turbulence
is driven by vortex-stretching and reconnection mechanisms. Since these physical phenomena are
observed in numerous flows of variable-density, this study constitutes the first step toward extending
the PANS method to such a class of problems. We start by deriving the governing equations of the model
and analyze the selection of the parameters controlling its physical resolution, fe and fk, through
a-priori testing. Afterward, we conduct PANS computations at different constant physical resolutions
to evaluate the model's accuracy and cost predicting the TGV flow. This is performed through simple
verification and validation exercises, and the physical and modeling interpretation of the numerical
predictions. The results confirm that PANS can efficiently (accuracy vs. cost) predict the present
flow problem. Yet, this is closely dependent on the physical resolution of the model. Whereas high-physical
resolution (fk<0.50) computations are in good agreement with the reference DNS studies, low-physical
resolution (fk>=0.50) simulations lead to large discrepancies with the reference data. The physical
and modeling interpretation of the results demonstrates that the origin of these distinct behaviors
lies in the model's ability to resolve the phenomena driving the onset of turbulence not amenable
to modeling by the closure. The comparison of the computations' cost indicates that high-physical
resolution PANS achieves the accuracy of DNS (fk=0.00) at a fraction of the cost. We observe a cost
reduction of one order of magnitude at the current Re, which is expected to grow with Re.

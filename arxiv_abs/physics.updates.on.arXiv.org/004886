Despite long-term efforts for exploring antibacterial agents or drugs, it remains challenging
how to potentiate antibacterial activity and meanwhile minimize toxicity hazards to the environment.
Here, we experimentally show that the functionality of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through copper
ions displays selective antibacterial activity significantly stronger than that of rGO itself
and no toxicity to mammalian cells. Remarkably, this antibacterial activity is two orders of magnitude
greater than the activity of its surrounding copper ions. We demonstrate that the rGO is functionalized
through the cation-${\pi}$ interaction to massively adsorb copper ions to form a rGO-copper composite
in solution and result in an extremely low concentration level of surrounding copper ions (less
than ~0.5 ${\mu}M$). These copper ions on rGO are positively charged and strongly interact with
negatively charged bacterial cells to selectively achieve antibacterial activity, while rGO
exhibits the functionality to not only actuate rapid delivery of copper ions and massive assembly
onto bacterial cells but also result in the valence shift in the copper ions from Cu$^{2+}$ into Cu$^{+}$
which greatly enhances the antibacterial activity. Notably, this functionality of rGO through
cation-${\pi}$ interaction with copper ions can similarly achieve algaecidal activity but does
not exert cytotoxicity against neutrally charged mammalian cells. The remarkable selective antibacterial
activity from the rGO functionality as well as the inherent broad-spectrum-antibacterial physical
mechanism represents a significant step toward the development of a novel antibacterial material
and reagent without environmental hazards for practical application.

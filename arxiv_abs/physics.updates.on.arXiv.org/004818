Discovering and isolating infected individuals is a cornerstone of epidemic control. Because
many infectious diseases spread through close contacts, contact tracing is a key tool for case discovery
and control. However, although contact tracing has been performed widely, the mathematical understanding
of contact tracing has not been fully established and it has not been clearly understood what determines
the efficacy of contact tracing. Here, we reveal that, compared with "forward" tracing---tracing
to whom disease spreads, "backward" tracing---tracing from whom disease spreads---is profoundly
more effective. The effectiveness of backward tracing is due to simple but overlooked biases arising
from the heterogeneity in contacts. Using simulations on both synthetic and high-resolution empirical
contact datasets, we show that even at a small probability of detecting infected individuals, strategically
executed contact tracing can prevent a significant fraction of further transmissions. We also
show that---in terms of the number of prevented transmissions per isolation---case isolation
combined with a small amount of contact tracing is more efficient than case isolation alone. By demonstrating
that backward contact tracing is highly effective at discovering super-spreading events, we argue
that the potential effectiveness of contact tracing has been underestimated. Therefore, there
is a critical need for revisiting current contact tracing strategies so that they leverage all forms
of biases. Our results also have important consequences for digital contact tracing because it
will be crucial to incorporate the capability for backward and deep tracing while adhering to the
privacy-preserving requirements of these new platforms.

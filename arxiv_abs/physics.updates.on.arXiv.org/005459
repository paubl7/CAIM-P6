The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented levels of disruption to the local and regional transportation
networks throughout the United States, especially the Motor City: Detroit. That was mainly a result
of swift restrictive measures such as statewide quarantine and lock-down orders to confine the
spread of the virus. This work is driven by analyzing five types of real-world data sets from Detroit
related to traffic volume, daily cases, weather, social distancing index, and crashes from January
2019 to June 2020. The primary goal is figuring out the impacts of COVID-19 on the transportation
network usage (traffic volume) and safety (crashes) for the Detroit, exploring the potential correlation
between these diverse data features, and determining whether each type of data (e.g., traffic volume
data) could be a useful factor in the confirmed-cases prediction. In addition, a deep learning model
was developed using long short-term memory networks to predict the number of confirmed cases within
the next one week. The model demonstrated a promising prediction result with a coefficient of determination
(R^2) of up to approximately 0.91. Moreover, in order to provide statistical evaluation measures
of confirmed-case prediction and to quantify the prediction effectiveness of each type of data,
the prediction results of six feature groups are presented and analyzed. Furthermore, six essential
observations with supporting evidence and analyses are presented. The goal of this paper is to present
a proposed approach which can be applied, customised, adjusted, and replicated for analysis of
the impact of COVID-19 on a transportation network and prediction of the anticipated COVID-19 cases
using a similar data set obtained for other large cities in the USA or from around the world.

The oil and gas industry is awash with sub-surface data, which is used to characterize the rock and
fluid properties beneath the seabed. This in turn drives commercial decision making and exploration,
but the industry currently relies upon highly manual workflows when processing data. A key question
is whether this can be improved using machine learning to complement the activities of petrophysicists
searching for hydrocarbons. In this paper we present work done, in collaboration with Rock Solid
Images (RSI), using supervised machine learning on a Cray XC30 to train models that streamline the
manual data interpretation process. With a general aim of decreasing the petrophysical interpretation
time down from over 7 days to 7 minutes, in this paper we describe the use of mathematical models that
have been trained using raw well log data, for completing each of the four stages of a petrophysical
interpretation workflow, along with initial data cleaning. We explore how the predictions from
these models compare against the interpretations of human petrophysicists, along with numerous
options and techniques that were used to optimise the prediction of our models. The power provided
by modern supercomputers such as Cray machines is crucial here, but some popular machine learning
framework are unable to take full advantage of modern HPC machines. As such we will also explore the
suitability of the machine learning tools we have used, and describe steps we took to work round their
limitations. The result of this work is the ability, for the first time, to use machine learning for
the entire petrophysical workflow. Whilst there are numerous challenges, limitations and caveats,
we demonstrate that machine learning has an important role to play in the processing of sub-surface
data.

Background: Despite lacking scientific support, vaccine hesitancy is widespread. While vaccine
damage as a scientific fact is statistically highly uncommon, emerging social and technological
forces have converted probable vaccine damage into an alternative fact. Methods: Using the Eurobarometer
91.2 survey on a statistically representative EU27-UK sample interviewed in March 2019, we documented
perceptions of vaccine risks and identified three belief configurations regarding vaccine effectiveness,
safety, and usefulness, through exploratory cluster analysis. Results: The public beliefs in
vaccine risks are frequent. Approximatively one-tenth of the EU27-UK population consider vaccines
are not rigorously tested before authorization, one-third believe vaccines can overload or weaken
the immune system and that they can cause the disease against which they protect, and almost one-half
believe vaccines can cause serious side effects. We identified three belief configurations: the
skeptical, the confident, and the trade-off clusters. The skeptical type (approx. 11 percent of
EU27-UK respondents) is defined by the belief that vaccines are rather ineffective, affected by
risks of probable vaccine damage, not well-tested, and useless; the confident type (approx. 59
percent) is defined by beliefs that vaccines are effective, safe, well-tested, and useful; and
the trade-off type (approx. 29 percent) combines beliefs that vaccines are effective, well-tested
and useful, with beliefs of probable vaccine damage. Conclusions: Probable vaccine damage presently
exists as an alternative fact in the public imagination, perceptively available for wide segments
of the public, including those who trust medical science.

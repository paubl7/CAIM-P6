Nanopores that exhibit ionic current rectification (ICR) behave like diodes, such that they transport
ions more efficiently in one direction than the other. Conical nanopores have been shown to rectify
ionic current, but only those with at least 500 nm in length exhibit significant ICR. Here, through
the finite element method, we show how ICR of conical nanopores with length below 200 nm can be tuned
by controlling individual charged surfaces i.e. inner pore surface (surface_inner), and exterior
pore surfaces on the tip and base side (surface_tip and surface_base). The charged surface_inner
and surface_tip can induce obvious ICR individually, while the effects of the charged surface_base
on ICR can be ignored. The fully charged surface_inner alone could render the nanopore counterion-selective
and induces significant ion concentration polarization in the tip region, which causes reverse
ICR compared to nanopores with all surface charged. In addition, the direction and degree of rectification
can be further tuned by the depth of the charged surface_inner. When considering the exterior membrane
surface only, the charged surface_tip causes intra-pore ionic enrichment and depletion under
opposite biases which results in significant ICR. Its effective region is within ~40 nm beyond the
tip orifice. We also found that individual charged parts of the pore system contributed to ICR in
an additive way due to the additive effect on the ion concentration regulation along the pore axis.
With various combinations of fully/partially charged surface_inner and surface_tip, diverse
ICR ratios from ~2 to ~170 can be achieved. Our findings shed light on the mechanism of ionic current
rectification in ultra-short conical nanopores, and provide a useful guide to the design and modification
of ultra-short conical nanopores in ionic circuits and nanofluidic sensors.

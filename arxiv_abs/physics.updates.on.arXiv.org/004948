We studied the effect of self-interaction error (SIE) on the static dipole polarizabilities of
water clusters modelled with three increasingly sophisticated, non-empirical density functional
approximations (DFAs), viz. the local spin density approximation (LDA), the Perdew-Burke-Ernzherof
(PBE) generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), and the strongly constrained and appropriately
normed (SCAN) meta-GGA, using the Perdew-Zunger self-interaction-correction (PZ-SIC) energy
functional in the Fermi-L\"owdin orbital SIC (FLO-SIC) framework. Our results show that while
all three DFAs overestimate the cluster polarizabilities, the description systematically improves
from LDA to PBE to SCAN. The self-correlation free SCAN predicts polarizabilities quite accurately
with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.58 Bohr$^3$ with respect to coupled cluster singles and doubles
(CCSD) values. Removing SIE using PZ-SIC correctly reduces the DFA polarizabilities, but over-corrects,
resulting in underestimated polarizabilities in SIC-LDA, -PBE, and -SCAN. Finally, we applied
a recently proposed local-scaling SIC (LSIC) method using a quasi self-consistent scheme and using
the kinetic energy density ratio as an iso-orbital indicator. The results show that the LSIC polarizabilities
are in excellent agreement with mean absolute error of 0.08 Bohr$^3$ for LSIC-LDA and 0.06 Bohr$^3$
for LSIC-PBE with most recent CCSD polarizabilities. Likewise, the ionization energy estimates
as an absolute of highest occupied energy eigenvalue predicted by LSIC are also in excellent agreement
with CCSD(T) ionization energies with MAE of 0.4 eV for LSIC-LDA and 0.04 eV for LSIC-PBE. The LSIC-LDA
predictions of ionization energies are comparable to the reported GW ionization energies while
the LSIC-PBE ionization energies are more accurate than reported GW results.

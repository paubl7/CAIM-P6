The Unitary Group Adapted State-Specific Multi-Reference Perturbation Theory (UGA-SSMRPT2)
developed by Mukherjee et al [J. Comput. Chem. 2015, 36, 670] has successfully realized the goal
of studying bond dissociation in a numerically stable, spin-preserving and size-consistent manner.
In this paper, we explore and analyse the UGA-SSMRPT2 theory in the description of avoided crossings
and interlacing between a manifold of states belonging to the same space-spin symmetry. In a state-specific
formalism, since each state is an eigenstate of its own effective operator, to include the information
of the other states requires the theory to be sufficiently accurate. Three different aspects of
UGA-SSMRPT2 have been studied: (a) We introduce and develop the most rigorous version of UGA-SSMRPT2
which emerges from the rigorous version of UGA-SSMRCC utilizing a linearly independent virtual
manifold; we call this the 'projection' version of UGA-SSMRPT2 denoted as UGA-SSMRPT2 Scheme P.
We compare and contrast this approach with our earlier formulation that used extra sufficiency
conditions via amplitude equations, which we will denote as UGA-SSMRPT2 Scheme A. (b) We present
the results for a variety of electronic states of a set of molecules which display the striking accuracy
of both the two versions of UGA-SSMRPT2; with respect to three different situations involving weakly
avoided crossings, moderate/strongly avoided crossings and interlacing in a manifold of PECs
of same symmetry. Accuracy of our results has been benchmarked against IC-MRCISD+Q. (c) For weakly
avoided crossing between states displaying differently charged sectors in the asymptotes, the
insufficient inclusion of state-specific orbital relaxation in a second order perturbative theory
might lead to an artefact of double crossing between the pair of PECs.

Mixed-use urbanism affords access to diverse assortments of land-uses within a pedestrian-accessible
context. It confers advantages such as reductions to driving, air pollution, and Body Mass Index
with associated increases in active transportation and improvements to health. However, whereas
mixed-use urbanism is clearly beneficial, methods for measuring and assessing the presence of
mixed-uses at a granular level of analysis remain murkier. This work demonstrates techniques for
gauging mixed-uses in more spatially precise terms concurring more readily with an urbanist's
conception of pedestrian-accessible mixed-uses. It does so through the use of the cityseer-api
Python package, which facilitates the use of spatially granular land-use classification data
assigned to adjacent street edges and then aggregated dynamically, with distances measured from
each point of analysis to each accessible land-use while taking the direction of approach into account.
It is argued that Hill Numbers is a suitable measure of diversity because it can mirror the intent
of traditional indices while behaving more intuitively. Further, distance-weighted formulations
of Hill diversity can be applied with spatial impedances, thus conferring a particularly spatially
nuanced gauge of local access to mixed-uses. These methods and indices are demonstrated for Greater
London with observations correlated to Principal Component Analysis derived from a range of land-use
accessibilities measured from the same locations and for the same point-of-interest dataset.
The Hill diversity measures, particularly the distance-weighted formulations, offer the most
robust correlations for both expansive mixed-use districts and more local 'high-street' mixes
of uses while yielding the most intuitive and spatially precise behaviour in the accompanying plots.

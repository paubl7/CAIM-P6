Understanding the detailed flame transport in IC engines is important to predict ignition, rate
of heat release and assess engine performance. This is particularly important for RANS and LES engine
simulations, which often struggle to accurately predict flame propagation and heat release without
first adjusting model parameters. Detailed measurements of flame transport are required to guide
model development. This work introduces an experimental dataset designed to study the detailed
flame transport and flame/flow dynamics for SI engines. Simultaneous dual-plane OH-LIF and stereoscopic
PIV is used to acquire 3D measurements of unburnt gas velocity, flame displacement speed and overall
flame velocity during the early flame development. Experiments are performed in an optical engine
operating at 800 and 1500 RPM with premixed C8H18-air mixtures. Analysis reveals several distinctive
flame/flow configurations that yield a positive or negative flame displacement for which the flame
progresses towards the reactants or products, respectively. For the operating conditions utilized,
Sd exhibits and inverse relationship with flame curvature; a strong correlation between negative
Sd and convex flame contours is observed. Trends are consistent with thermo-diffusive flames,
but have not been quantified in IC engines. Flame wrinkling is more severe at the higher RPM, which
broadens Sd distribution towards higher positive and negative velocities. Spatially-resolved
distributions of Ugas and Sd describe in-cylinder locations where convection or thermal diffusion
is the dominating mechanism contributing to flame transport. Findings are discussed in relation
to common engine flow features, including flame transport near solid surfaces. Findings are designed
to support engine simulation validations.

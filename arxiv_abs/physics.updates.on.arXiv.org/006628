We present two generalized hybrid kinetic-Hall MHD models describing the interaction of a two-fluid
bulk plasma, consisting of thermal ions and electrons, with energetic, suprathermal ion populations
described by Vlasov dynamics. The dynamics of the thermal components are governed by standard fluid
equations in the Hall MHD limit $(m_e\rightarrow 0)$, with the electron momentum equation providing
an Ohm's law with Hall terms. In addition, electron kinetic effects are incorporated upon considering
an anisotropic electron pressure tensor. The coupling of the bulk, low-energy plasma with the energetic
particle dynamics is accomplished through the current density (Current Coupling Scheme-CCS)
and the ion pressure tensor appearing in the momentum equation (Pressure Coupling Scheme-PCS)
in the first and the second model, respectively. The CCS is a generalization of the ordinary Hall
MHD and the hybrid kinetic-ion/fluid-electron models, since in the limit of vanishing energetic
and thermal ion densities we recover the standard Hall MHD (HMHD) and the hybrid kinetic-ion/fluid
electron models, respectively. This provides us with the capability to study in a continuous way
the global impact of the energetic particles in a regime extending from vanishing to dominant energetic
particle densities. The noncanonical Hamiltonian structures of the aforementioned models, which
can be employed to study equilibrium and stability properties via the energy-Casimir variational
principle, are identified. As a first application here, we derive a generalized Hall MHD Grad-Shafranov-Bernoulli
system for translationally symmetric equilibria with anisotropic electron pressure and kinetic
effects due to energetic particles in the PCS.

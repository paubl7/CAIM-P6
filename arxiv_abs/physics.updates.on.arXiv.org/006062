Cooperation in an open dynamic system fundamentally depends upon information distributed across
its components. Yet in an environment with rapidly enlarging complexity, this information may
need to change adaptively to enable not only cooperation but also the mere survival of an organism.
Combining the methods of evolutionary game theory, agent-based simulation, and statistical physics,
we develop a model of the evolution of cooperation in an ageing population of artificial decision
makers playing spatial tag-mediated prisoner's dilemma games with their ingroup neighbors and
with genetically unrelated immigrant agents. In our model with six strategies we introduce the
concept of time-varying tags such that the phenotypic features of 'new' agents can change into 'approved'
following variable approval times. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that ingroup-biased ethnocentric
cooperation can dominate only at low costs and short approval times. In the standard 4-strategy
model with fixed tags, we identified a critical cost $c_{\mathrm{crit}}$ above which cooperation
transitioned abruptly into the phase of pure defection, revealing remarkable fragility of ingroup-biased
generosity. In our generalized 6-strategy model with time-varying tags, elevated cooperation
was observed for a wider region of the parameter space, peaking at intermediate approval times and
cost values above $c_{\mathrm{crit}}$. Our findings show that in an open system subject to immigration
dynamics, high levels of social cooperation are possible if a fraction of the population adopts
the strategy with an egalitarian generosity directed towards both native and approved naturalized
citizens, regardless of their actual origin. These findings also suggest that instead of relying
upon arbitrarily fixed approval times, there is an optimal duration of the naturalization procedure
from which the society as a whole can profit most.

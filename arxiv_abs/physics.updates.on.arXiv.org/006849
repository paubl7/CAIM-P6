In this paper, we analyze the performance of pure and doped Be ablators used for Inertial Confinement
Fusion (ICF) pellets in terms of shock velocity, shock breakout temperature, preheat temperature
and mass ablation rate through radiation hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations. For this study, we apply
a constant radiation profile (drive temperatures varying from 120 - 200 eV) consisting of a low frequency
Planck spectrum (soft x-rays) and a high frequency Gaussian spectrum (hard x-rays, commonly termed
as "M-band") on a planar foil of the ablator. The fraction of energy density in the hard x-ray spectrum
($\alpha$) has been varied from 0 to 0.25. The predominant effect of hard x-rays is to preheat the
ablator ahead of the shock front. Steady rise in preheat temperature and shock breakout temperature
is observed on increasing the fraction of hard x-rays. Preheating can be mitigated by doping Be with
a mid-Z element Cu as its opacity is much higher in the high frequency region. On doping Be with 1\%
Cu, the shock velocities decrease slightly compared to pure Be. However, higher shock velocities
are observed on increasing the fraction of M-band. We observe significant decrease in shock breakout
and maximum preheat temperature in doped Be foil. Steady rise in these temperatures is observed
on increasing $\alpha$. We have proposed new scaling relations for shock velocity, shock breakout
temperature, maximum preheat temperature and mass ablation rate with the radiation temperature
and the fraction of M-band energy density in both pure and doped Be ablators. In terms of ablator performance,
Cu doped Be ablator is found to be superior to pure Be. Though doping significantly reduces preheating,
the mass ablation rates are nearly unaffected.

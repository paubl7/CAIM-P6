The amplification of evanescent waves by flat superlens requires a near-resonance coupling which
has been linked to resonant surface plasmons. A subtle interplay has been proposed to exist between
the excitation of well-defined resonant surface plasmons and the focusing capability of a superlens.
To gain insights into these resonant modes and their contributions to the amplification and recovery
of evanescent waves, we performed simple but robust full-wave FDTD simulations on causal negative
index Lorentz models. We found that well-defined pair of resonant surface plasmons is excited whenever
a coupling of a diverging transmitted beam and a converging refracted beam occurs at the second interface.
The resonant coupling of these modes at the interface led to the excitation of a single interface
resonance predicted by the theory. The physical consequence of this resonance is that incident
wave energy is pumped into the negative-index material medium and beyond it. These phenomena contribute
substantially to the amplification and recovery of the near-fields in the image plane. It is noteworthy
that, for evanescent wave refocusing to be achieved in a flat superlens, its thickness, and the source-to-superlens
distance should be optimized. This optimization is critical in that an optimal thickness alongside
optimal source-to-superlens distance will allow evanescent wave refocusing to dominate material
lost. The FDTD simulated result showed an image of the point source inside the superlens and beyond
it when its thickness was optimized. The resolution of the image beyond the superlens was $\sim.58\lambda$
and this superlens behaves like a near-perfect lens. Overall, these numerically simulated results
could serve as useful approximations to the degree of resonant amplification and refocusing of
near-fields that can be achieved by flat superlens in near-fields experimental imaging setups.

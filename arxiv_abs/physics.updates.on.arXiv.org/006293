A recent analysis has revealed singular but physically relevant 2D localized vortex states with
density ~ 1/r^{4/3} at r --> 0 and a convergent total norm, which are maintained by the interplay of
the potential of the attraction to the center, ~ -1/r^2, and a self-repulsive quartic nonlinearity,
produced by the Lee-Huang-Yang correction to the mean-field dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates.
In optics, a similar setting, with the density singularity ~ 1/r, is realized with the help of quintic
self-defocusing. Here we present physically relevant antidark singular-vortex states in these
systems, existing on top of a flat background. Numerical solutions for them are very accurately
approximated by the Thomas-Fermi wave function. Their stability exactly obeys an analytical criterion
derived for small perturbations. It is demonstrated that the singular vortices can be excited by
the input in the form of ordinary nonsingular vortices, hence the singular modes can be created in
the experiment. We also consider regular (dark) vortices maintained by the flat background, under
the action of the repulsive central potential ~ +1/r^2. The dark modes with vorticities l = 0 and l
= 1 are completely stable. In the case when the central potential is attractive, but the effective
one, which includes the centrifugal term, is repulsive, and a weak trapping potential ~ r^2 is added,
dark vortices with l = 1 feature an intricate pattern of alternating stability and instability regions.
Under the action of the instability, states with l = 1 travel along tangled trajectories, which stay
in a finite area defined by the trap. The analysis is also reported for dark vortices with l = 2, which
feature a complex structure of alternating intervals of stability and instability against splitting.
Lastly, simple but novel flat vortices are found at the border between the anidark and dark ones.

A proper description of ocean-atmosphere interactions is key for a correct understanding of climate
evolution. The interplay among the different variables acting over the climate is complex, often
leading to correlations across long spatial distances (teleconnections). In some occasions,
those teleconnections occur with quite significant temporal shifts that are fundamental for the
understanding of the underlying phenomena but which are poorly captured by standard methods. Applying
orthogonal decomposition such as Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) to geophysical data sets allows
to extract common dominant patterns between two different variables, but generally suffers from
(i) the nonphysical orthogonal constraint as well as (ii) the consideration of simple correlations,
whereby temporally offset signals are not detected. Here we propose an extension, complex rotated
MCA, to address both limitations. We transform our signals using the Hilbert transform and perform
the orthogonal decomposition in complex space, allowing us to correctly correlate out-of-phase
signals. Subsequent Varimax rotation removes the orthogonal constraints, leading to more physically
meaningful modes of geophysical variability. As an example of application, we have employed this
method on sea surface temperature and continental precipitation; our method successfully captures
the temporally and spatially interactions between these two variables, namely for (i) the seasonal
cycle, (ii) canonical ENSO, (iii) the global warming trend, (iv) the Pacific Decadal Oscillation,
(v) ENSO Modoki and finally (vi) the Atlantic Meridional Modulation. The complex modes of MCA provide
information on the regional amplitude, and under certain conditions, the regional time lag between
changes on ocean temperature and land precipitation.

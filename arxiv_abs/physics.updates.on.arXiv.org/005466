Oscillation of sessile drops is important to many applications. In the present study, the natural
oscillation of a sessile drop on flat surfaces with free contact lines (FCL) is investigated through
numerical and theoretical analysis. The FCL condition represents a limit of contact line mobility,
i.e. the contact angle remains constant when the contact line moves. In the numerical simulation,
the interfaces are captured by the volume-of-fluid method and the contact angle at the boundary
is specified using the height-function method. The oscillation frequencies for sessile drops
with FCL are mainly controlled by the contact angle and the Bond number and a parametric study is carried
out to characterize their effects on the frequencies for the first and high-order modes. Particular
attention is paid to the frequency of the first mode, since it is usually the dominant mode. An inviscid
theoretical model for the first mode is developed. The model yields an explicit expression for the
first-mode frequency as a function of the contact angle and the Bond number, with all parameters
involved fully determined by the equilibrium drop theory and the simulation. The predicted frequencies
for a wide range of contact angles agree very well with the simulation results for small Bond numbers.
The frequencies for both the first and high-order modes decrease with the contact angle and increase
with the Bond number. For the high-order modes, the frequencies for different modes generally scale
with the Rayleigh frequencies. The scaling relation performs better for small Bond numbers and
large contact angles. A simple model is proposed to predict the frequencies of high-order modes
for large contact angles and a good agreement with the simulation results is observed.

Background: Monte Carlo simulations of diffusion are commonly used as a model validation tool as
they are especially suitable for generating the diffusion MRI signal in complicated tissue microgeometries.
New method: Here we describe the details of implementing Monte Carlo simulations in three-dimensional
(3d) voxelized segmentations of cells in microscopy images. Using the concept of the corner reflector,
we largely reduce the computational load of simulating diffusion within and exchange between multiple
cells. Precision is further achieved by GPU-based parallel computations. Results: Our simulation
result of diffusion in the exemplified white matter axons segmented from a mouse brain demonstrates
its power and value in validations of biophysical models. Furthermore, we provide the theoretical
background for implementing a discretized diffusion process, and consider the finite-step effects
of the particle-membrane reflection and permeation events, needed for efficient simulation of
interactions with irregular boundaries, variable diffusion coefficient, and exchange. Comparison
with existing methods: To our knowledge, this is the first Monte Carlo pipeline for MR signal simulations
in a substrate composed of numerous realistic cells, accounting for their permeable and irregularly-shaped
membranes. Conclusions: The proposed RMS pipeline makes it possible to achieve fast and accurate
simulations of diffusion in realistic tissue microgeometry, as well as the interplay with other
MR contrasts. Presently, RMS focuses on simulations of diffusion, exchange, and T1 and T2 NMR relaxation
in static tissues, with a possibility to straightforwardly account for susceptibility-induced
T2* effects and flow.

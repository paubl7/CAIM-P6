This study concerns the effects of pressure, spatial location, and application of oil emulsions
on the resulting droplet size, eccentricity, as well as velocity distributions, all of which are
crucial information in determining the dispersion dynamics of the droplets during the spray applications.
Experiments were conducted with the abovementioned droplets information measured using digital
inline holography (DIH). Results show that the volumetric droplet size distributions (VDSD) span
widely from sub-200 um to over 2 mm in size. The application of an oil-in-water emulsion results largely
in the suppression of smaller droplets, while the VDSD is relatively insensitive to increasing
the oil volume fraction beyond a critical level. DIH additionally enables the determination of
size-dependent droplet eccentricity and velocity measurements. Interestingly, the application
of oil-in-water emulsion generally decreases the eccentricity, more significantly at the center
than at the edge of the spray fan. We attribute this decrease to the increase in lamella sheet thickness
and thus decrease in characteristic shrinkage rates, consistent with the observation using high-speed
shadowgraphs. In all instances, oil-in-water emulsion droplets have higher velocities than equivalent
sized water droplets. We attribute this to the earlier action of the spray breakup process in the
oil-in-water emulsion, reduced surface energy generation during a breakup (larger droplets),
and reduce energy dissipation during breakup with oil-in-water emulsions, leading to increased
translational energy after the breakup process. Therefore, it appears that oil-in-water emulsion
application simultaneously suppresses small droplet formation and increases droplet velocity,
and hence spray penetration in agricultural application.

The absolute-scale electronic energetics of liquid water and aqueous solutions, both in the bulk
and at associated interfaces, are the central determiners of water-based chemistry. However,
such information is generally experimentally inaccessible. We demonstrate that a refined implementation
of the liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) technique can be adopted to address this.
Implementing concepts from condensed matter physics, we establish novel all-liquid-phase vacuum
and equilibrated solution-metal-electrode Fermi level referencing procedures. This enables
the precise and accurate quantification of previously elusive solute-induced perturbations
of water's electronic energetics and vertical ionization energy (VIE) definition on an absolute
and universal chemical potential scale. Applying these procedures over a broad range of ionization
energies, we accurately and respectively determine the VIE and oxidative stability of liquid water
as 11.33 $\pm$ 0.02 eV and 6.60 $\pm$ 0.08 eV with respect to its liquid-vacuum-interface potential
and Fermi level. Combining our referencing schemes, we determine the work function of liquid water
as 4.73 $\pm$ 0.09 eV. Further, applying our novel approach to a pair of exemplary aqueous solutions,
we extract absolute VIEs of aqueous iodide anions, reaffirm the robustness of water's electronic
structure to high bulk salt concentrations, and quantify reference-level dependent reductions
of water's VIE and a 0.48 $\pm$ 0.13 eV contraction of the solution's work function upon partial hydration
of a known surfactant. Our combined experimental accomplishments mark a major advance in our ability
to quantify electronic-structure interactions and chemical reactivity in water, which now explicitly
extends to the measurement of absolute-scale bulk and interfacial solution energetics, including
those of relevance to aqueous electrochemical processes.

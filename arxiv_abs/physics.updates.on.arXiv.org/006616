The paper explores the notion of a reconfiguration of political space in the context of the rise of
populism and its effects on the political system. We focus on Germany and the appearance of the new
right wing party "Alternative for Germany" (AfD). Many scholars of politics discuss the rise of
the new populism in Western Europe and the US with respect to a new political cleavage related to globalization,
which is assumed to mainly affect the cultural dimension of the political space. As such, it might
replace the older economic cleavage based on class divisions in defining the dominant dimension
of political conflict. An explanation along these lines suggests a reconfiguration of the political
space in the sense that (1) the main cleavage within the political space changes its direction from
the economic axis towards the cultural axis, but (2) also the semantics of the cultural axis itself
is changing towards globalization related topics. Using the electoral manifestos from the Manifesto
project database, we empirically address this reconfiguration of the political space by comparing
political spaces for Germany built using topic modeling with the spaces based on the content analysis
of the Manifesto project and the corresponding categories of political goals. We find that both
spaces have a similar structure and that the AfD appears on a new dimension. In order to characterize
this new dimension we employ a novel technique, inter-issue consistency networks (IICN) that allow
to analyze the evolution of the correlations between the political positions on different issues
over several elections. We find that the new dimension introduced by the AfD can be related to the
split off of a new "cultural right" issue bundle from the previously existing center-right bundle.

We investigate the transition of the solar wind turbulent cascade from MHD to sub-ion range by means
of a detail comparison between in situ observations and hybrid numerical simulations. In particular
we focus on the properties of the magnetic field and its component anisotropy in Cluster measurements
and hybrid 2D simulations. First, we address the angular distribution of wave-vectors in the kinetic
range between ion and electron scales by studying the variance anisotropy of the magnetic field
components. When taking into account the single-direction sampling performed by spacecraft in
the solar wind, the main properties of the fluctuations observed in situ are also recovered in our
numerical description. This result confirms that solar wind turbulence in the sub-ion range is
characterized by a quasi-2D gyrotropic distribution of k-vectors around the mean field. We then
consider the magnetic compressibility associated with the turbulent cascade and its evolution
from large-MHD to sub-ion scales. The ratio of field-aligned to perpendicular fluctuations, typically
low in the MHD inertial range, increases significantly when crossing ion scales and its value in
the sub-ion range is a function of the total plasma beta only, as expected from theoretical predictions,
with higher magnetic compressibility for higher beta. Moreover, we observe that this increase
has a gradual trend from low to high beta values in the in situ data; this behaviour is well captured
by the numerical simulations. The level of magnetic field compressibility that is observed in situ
and in the simulations is in fairly good agreement with theoretical predictions, especially at
high beta, suggesting that in the kinetic range explored the turbulence is supported by low-frequency
and highly-oblique fluctuations in pressure balance, like kinetic Alfv\'en waves or other slowly
evolving coherent structures.

Non-pharmacologic interventions (NPIs) are one method to mitigate the spread and effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. NPIs promote protective actions to reduce exposure risk
and can reduce mobility patterns within communities. Growing research literature suggests that
socially vulnerable populations are disproportionately impacted with higher infection and higher
fatality rates of COVID-19, though there is limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms
to this health disparity. Thus, the research examines two distinct and complimentary datasets
at a granular scale for five urban locations. Through statistical and spatial analyses, the research
extensively investigates the exposure risk reduction of socially vulnerable populations due
to NPIs. The mobility dataset tracks population movement across ZIP codes; it is used for an origin-destination
network analysis. The population activity dataset is based on the number of visits from census block
groups (CBG) to points of interest (POIs), such as grocery stores, restaurants, education centers,
and medical facilities; it is used for network analysis of population-facilities interactions.
The mobility dataset showed that, after the implementation of NPIs, socially vulnerable populations
engaged in increased mobility in the form of inflow between ZIP code areas. Similarly, population
activity analysis showed an increased exposure risk for socially vulnerable populations based
on a greater number of inflow visits of CBGs to POIs, which increases the risk of contact at POIs, and
a greater number of outflow visits from POIs to home CBGs, which increases risk of transmission within
CBGs. These findings can assist emergency planners and public health officials in comprehending
how different groups are able to implement protective actions and can inform more equitable and
data-driven NPI policies for future epidemics.

The purpose of marine seismic experiments is to provide information of the structure and physical
properties of the subsurface. The p-wave velocity distribution is the most commonly modelled property,
usually by inversion of waveform attributes. In wide-angle reflection (WAS) experiments, arrival
times of seismic phases identified in Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS), are used to image relatively
deep structures. As alternative to WAS experiments, the shallow subsurface is commonly studied
with Multi-Channel Seismic (MCS) data collected in towed streamers. In this case, the recording
of refractions is limited primarily by the streamer length and by structural features and, in general,
a considerable amount of the refractions are masked by reflections and noise. The most widely used
tool to extract refraction information from MCS data is the so-called downward continuation technique,
which is designed to redatuming streamer field data to the seafloor. In this new virtual configuration,
the early refractions transform to first arrivals becoming visible from zero offset, which facilitates
identification and use in travel-time tomography. However, there is little literature, let alone
available codes, to be used with the available MCS data sets. This work presents a user friendly open
source HPC software for redatuming 2D streamer field data to the sea bottom for any seafloor relief.
The main ingredient is the acoustic wave equation used backward in time. Assessment tools are provided
to evaluate the information available after redatuming for specific data acquisition configurations.
Also, we present a step-by-step analysis that defines the most important features that influence
the quality of the redatumed, virtual recordings.

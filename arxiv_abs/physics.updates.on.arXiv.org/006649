To explore the role of the olivine grain size and crystal preferred orientation (CPO) on the evolution
of the microstructure and the mechanical behaviour of upper mantle rocks up to large strains, we
performed axial extension experiments at 1200C, 300MPa confining pressure, and constant displacement
rate on three natural peridotites: a fine-grained mylonitic harzburgite with a weak CPO and two
coarse-grained well-equilibrated dunites with CPO of variable intensity. Initial flow stresses
show a limited range of variation (115-165MPa), with the fine-grained sample showing the highest
initial strength. However, the evolution of both mechanical behavior and microstructure differs
between fine and coarse-grained peridotites. In the fine-grained harzburgite, necking resulted
in decrease in the apparent differential stress. Focusing of strain and stress produced increase
of the olivine recrystallized fraction and decrease of the recrystallized grain size in the neck.
Analysis of the final stress and strain in the neck indicates softening due to evolution of the microstructure
and CPO. In contrast, necking of the coarse-grained samples produced weak or no decrease in the apparent
differential stress. This implies hardening, consistently with the increase in bulk intragranular
misorientation and final stresses in the neck similar or higher than initial ones. Coarse-grained
dunites deformed heterogeneously. Crystals well oriented to deform by dislocation glide became
elongated, whereas those in hard orientations remained almost undeformed. In the neck, stress
and strain concentration resulted in formation of kinks in hard crystals and dynamic recrystallization
in soft crystals. We interpret the more effective strain-induced softening of the fine-grained
peridotite as due to easier dynamic recrystallization, probably due to the higher proportion of
grain boundaries acting as nucleation sites.

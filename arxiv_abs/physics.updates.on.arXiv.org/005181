Zero- to ultralow-field (ZULF) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a version of NMR that allows
studying molecules and their transformations in the regime dominated by intrinsic spin-spin interactions.
While spin dynamics at zero magnetic field can be probed indirectly, J-spectra can also be measured
at zero field by using non-inductive sensors, for example, optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs).
A J-spectrum can be detected when a molecule contains at least two different types of magnetic nuclei
(i.e., nuclei with different gyromagnetic ratios) that are coupled via J-coupling. Up to date,
no pure J-spectra of molecules featuring the coupling to quadrupolar nuclei were reported. Here
we show that zero-field J-spectra can be collected from molecules containing quadrupolar nuclei
with I = 1 and demonstrate this for solutions containing various isotopologues of ammonium cations.
Lower ZULF NMR signals are observed for molecules containing larger numbers of deuterons compared
to protons; this is attributed to less overall magnetization and not to the scalar relaxation of
the second kind. We analyze the energy structure and allowed transitions for the studied molecular
cations in detail using perturbation theory and demonstrate that in the studied systems, different
lines in J-spectra have different dependencies on the magnetic pulse length allowing for unique
on-demand zero-field spectral editing. Precise values for the 15N-1H, 14N-1H, and D-1H coupling
constants are extracted from the spectra and the difference in the reduced coupling constants is
explained by the secondary isotope effect. Simple symmetric cations such as ammonium do not require
expensive isotopic labeling for the observation of J-spectra and, thus, may expand applicability
of ZULF NMR spectroscopy in biomedicine and energy storage.

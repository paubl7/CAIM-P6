In the May-Leonard model of three cyclically competing species, we analyze the statistics of rare
events in which all three species go extinct due to strong but rare fluctuations. These fluctuations
are from the tails of the probability distribution of species concentrations. They render a coexistence
of three populations unstable even if the coexistence is stable in the deterministic limit. We determine
the mean time to extinction (MTE) by using a WKB-ansatz in the master equation that represents the
stochastic description of this model. This way, the calculation is reduced to a problem of classical
mechanics and amounts to solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with zero-energy Hamiltonian. We
solve the corresponding Hamilton's equations of motion in six-dimensional phase space numerically
by using the Iterative Action Minimization Method. This allows to project on the optimal path to
extinction, starting from a parameter choice where the three-species coexistence-fixed point
undergoes a Hopf bifurcation and becomes stable. Specifically for our system of three species,
extinction events can be triggered along various paths to extinction, differing in their intermediate
steps. We compare our analytical predictions with results from Gillespie simulations for two-species
extinctions, complemented by an analytical calculation of the MTE in which the remaining third
species goes extinct. From Gillespie simulations we also analyze how the distributions of times
to extinction change upon varying the bifurcation parameter. Even within the same model and the
same dynamical regime, the MTE depends on the distance from the bifurcation point in a way that contains
the system size dependence in the exponent. It is challenging and worthwhile to quantify how rare
the rare events of extinction are.

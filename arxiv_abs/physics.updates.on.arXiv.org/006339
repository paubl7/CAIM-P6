Several biological and social contagion phenomena, such as superspreading events or social reinforcement,
are the results of multi-body interactions, for which hypergraphs offer a natural mathematical
description. In this paper, we develop a novel mathematical framework based on approximate master
equations to study contagions on random hypergraphs with a heterogeneous structure, both in terms
of group size (hyperedge cardinality) and of membership of nodes to groups (hyperdegree). The characterization
of the inner dynamics of groups provides an accurate description of the contagion process, without
losing the analytical tractability. Using a contagion model where multi-body interactions are
mapped onto a nonlinear infection rate, our two main results show how large groups are influential,
in the sense that they drive both the early spread of a contagion and its endemic state (i.e., its stationary
state). First, we provide a detailed characterization of the phase transition, which can be continuous
or discontinuous with a bistable regime, and derive analytical expressions for the critical and
tricritical points. We find that large values of the third moment of the membership distribution
suppress the emergence of a discontinuous phase transition. Furthermore, the combination of heterogeneous
group sizes and nonlinear contagion facilitates the onset of a mesoscopic localization phase,
where contagion is sustained only by the largest groups, thereby inhibiting bistability as well.
Second, we formulate a simple problem of optimal seeding for hypergraph contagions to compare two
strategies: tuning the allocation of seeds according to either node individual properties or according
to group properties. We find that, when the contagion is sufficiently nonlinear, groups are more
effective seeds of contagion than individual nodes.

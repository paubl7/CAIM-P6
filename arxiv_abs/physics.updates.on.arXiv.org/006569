While quantum mechanics (QM) is covered at length in introductory physics textbooks, the concept
of quantum entanglement is typically not covered at all, despite its importance in the rapidly growing
area of quantum information science and its extensive experimental confirmation. Thus, physics
educators are left to their own devices as to how to introduce this important concept. Regardless
of how a physics educator chooses to introduce quantum entanglement, they face a trilemma involving
its mysterious Bell-inequality-violating correlations. They can compromise on the the completeness
of their introduction and simply choose not to share that fact. They can frustrate their more curious
students by introducing the mystery and simply telling them that the QM formalism with its associated
(equally mysterious) conservation law maps beautifully to the experiments, so there is nothing
else that needs to be said. Or, they can compromise the rigor of their presentation and attempt to
resolve the mystery by venturing into the metaphysical quagmire of competing QM interpretations.
Herein, we resolve this trilemma in precisely the same way that Einstein resolved the mysteries
of time dilation and length contraction that existed in the late nineteenth century. That is, we
resort to "principle" explanation based on the mathematical consequences of "empirically discovered"
facts. Indeed, our principle account of quantum entanglement is even based on the same principle
Einstein used, i.e., the relativity principle or "no preferred reference frame." Thus, this principle
resolution of the trilemma is as complete, satisfying, analytically rigorous, and accessible
as the standard introduction of special relativity for first-year physics students.

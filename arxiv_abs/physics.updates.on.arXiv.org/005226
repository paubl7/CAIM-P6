Early-stage bedforms develop into mature dunes through complex interactions between wind, sand
transport and surface topography. Depending on varying environmental and wind conditions, the
mechanism driving dune formation and, ultimately, the shape of nascent dunes may differ markedly.
In cases where sand availability is plentiful one mechanism suggested for triggering dune growth
is linear stability theory. Until now, this theory has only been tested using field evidence in unidirectional
winds. However, in many areas of the world and on other planets where aeolian processes act, wind
regimes are often bimodal or multimodal. Here, we investigate field evidence of protodune formation
under bimodal winds by applying linear stability analysis to a developing protodune field. Employing
recent theoretical and experimental research, combined with in-situ wind, sediment transport,
and topographic measurements during a month long field campaign at Great Sand Dunes National Park,
Colorado, USA, we use a development of the linear stability theory to predict the spatial characteristics
(orientation and wavelength) and temporal evolution (growth rate and migration velocity) of a
protodune field. We find that the theoretical predictions compare well with measured dunefield
attributes as characterized by high-resolution Digital Elevation Models measured using repeat
terres trial laser scanning. Our findings suggest that linear stability theory is a quantitative
predictor of protodune development on sandy surfaces with a bimodal wind regime. Our findings are
significant as they offer critical validation of the linear stability theory for explaining the
initiation and development of dunes towards maturity in a complex natural environment.

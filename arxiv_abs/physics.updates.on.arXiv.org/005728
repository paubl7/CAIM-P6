In two earlier studies, we developed a new method to measure students' ability to transfer physics
problem solving skills to new contexts using a sequence of online learning modules, and implemented
two interventions in the form of additional learning modules designed to improve transfer ability.
The current paper introduces a new data analysis scheme that could improve the accuracy of the measurement
by accounting for possible differences in students' goal orientation and behavior, as well as revealing
the possible mechanism by which one of the two interventions improves transfer ability. Based on
a two by two framework of self-regulated learning, students with a performance-avoidance oriented
goal are more likely to guess on some of the assessment attempts in order to save time, resulting in
an underestimation of the student populations' transfer ability. The current analysis shows that
about half of the students had frequent brief initial assessment attempts, and significantly lower
correct rates on certain modules, which we think is likely to have originated at least in part from
students adopting a performance-avoidance strategy. We then divided the remaining population,
for which we can be certain that few students adopted a performance-avoidance strategy, based on
whether they interacted with one of the intervention modules designed to develop basic problem
solving skills, or passed that module on their first attempt without interacting with the instructional
material. By comparing to propensity score matched populations from a previous semester, we found
that the improvement in subsequent transfer performance observed in a previous study mainly came
from the latter population, suggesting that the intervention served as an effective reminder for
students to activate existing skills, but fell short of developing those skills among those who
have yet to master it.

We continue the study of Confined Vortex Surfaces (\CVS{}) that we introduced in the previous paper.
We classify the solutions of the \CVS{} equation and find the analytical formula for the velocity
field for arbitrary background strain eigenvalues in the stable region. The vortex surface cross-section
has the form of four symmetric hyperbolic sheets with a simple equation $|y| |x|^\mu =1$ in each quadrant
of the tube cross-section ($x y $ plane). We use the dilute gas approximation for the vorticity structures
in a turbulent flow, assuming their size is much smaller than the mean distance between them. We vindicate
this assumption by the scaling laws for the surface shrinking to zero in the extreme turbulent limit.
We introduce the Gaussian random background strain for each vortex surface as an accumulation of
a large number of small random contributions coming from other surfaces far away. We compute this
self-consistent background strain, relating the variance of the strain to the energy dissipation
rate. We find a universal asymmetric distribution for energy dissipation. A new phenomenon is a
probability distribution of the shape of the profile of the vortex tube in the $x y$ plane. Its fractal
dimension is a random variable distributed between $\ot$ and $\tt$. This phenomenon naturally
leads to the "multi-fractal" scaling of the moments of velocity difference $v(\vec r_1) - \vec v(\vec
r_2)$. We argue that the approximate relations for these moments suggested in a recent paper by Sreenivasan
and Yakhot are consistent with the \CVS{} theory. We reinterpret their renormalization parameter
$\alpha\approx 0.95$ in the Bernoulli law $ p = - \frac{1}{2}\alpha \vec v^2$ as a probability to
find no vortex surface at a random point in space.

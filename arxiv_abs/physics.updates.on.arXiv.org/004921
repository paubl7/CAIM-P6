This paper investigates the impact of cell body (soma) size and branching of cellular projections
on diffusion MR imaging (dMRI) and spectroscopy (dMRS) signals for both standard single diffusion
encoding (SDE) and more advanced double diffusion encoding (DDE) measurements using numerical
simulations. The aim is to study the ability of dMRI/dMRS to characterize the complex morphology
of brain grey matter, focusing on these two distinctive features. To this end, we employ a recently
developed framework to create realistic meshes for Monte Carlo simulations, covering a wide range
of soma sizes and branching orders of cellular projections, for diffusivities reflecting both
water and metabolites. For SDE sequences, we assess the impact of soma size and branching order on
the signal b-value dependence as well as the time dependence of the apparent diffusion coefficient
(ADC). For DDE sequences, we assess their impact on the mixing time dependence of the signal angular
modulation and of the estimated microscopic anisotropy, a promising contrast derived from DDE
measurements. The SDE results show that soma size has a measurable impact on both the b-value and
diffusion time dependence, for both water and metabolites. On the other hand, branching order has
little impact on either, especially for water. In contrast, the DDE results show that soma size has
a measurable impact on the signal angular modulation at short mixing times and the branching order
significantly impacts the mixing time dependence of the signal angular modulation as well as of
the derived microscopic anisotropy, for both water and metabolites. Our results confirm that soma
size can be estimated from SDE based techniques, and most importantly, show for the first time that
DDE measurements show sensitivity to the branching of cellular projections, paving the way for
non-invasive characterization of grey matter morphology.

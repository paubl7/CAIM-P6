Turbulence in the flow of fluid through a pipe can be suppressed by buoyancy forces. As the suppression
of turbulence leads to severe heat transfer deterioration, this is an important and undesirable
phenomenon in both heating and cooling applications. Vertical flow is often considered, as the
axial buoyancy force can help drive the flow. With heating measured by the buoyancy parameter $C$,
our DNS show that shear-driven turbulence may either be completely laminarised or transitions
to a relatively quiescent convection-driven state. Buoyancy forces cause a flattening of the base
flow profile, which in isothermal pipe flow has recently been linked to complete suppression of
turbulence (K\"{u}hnen et al. Nat. Phys., 2018), and the flattened laminar base profile has enhanced
nonlinear stability (Marensi et al. JFM, 2019). In agreement with these findings, the nonlinear
lower-branch travelling-wave solution analysed here, which is believed to mediate transition
to turbulence in isothermal pipe flow, is shown to be suppressed by buoyancy. A linear instability
of the laminar base flow is responsible for the appearance of the relatively quiescent convection
driven state for $C\gtrsim 4$ across the range of Reynolds numbers considered. In the suppression
of turbulence, however, i.e. in the transition from turbulence, we find clearer association with
the analysis of He et al. (JFM, 2016) than with the above dynamical systems approach, which describes
better the transition to turbulence. The laminarisation criterion He et al. propose, based on an
apparent Reynolds number of the flow as measured by its driving pressure gradient, is found to capture
the critical $C=C_{cr}(Re)$ above which the flow will be laminarised or switch to the convection-driven
type. Our analysis suggests that it is the weakened rolls, rather than the streaks, which appear
to be critical for laminarisation.

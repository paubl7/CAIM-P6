In contrast to a "single particle table-top trap", an essential feature of a storage ring "trap"
is that $10^{10}$ or more particles can have their spins aligned in a polarized beam. This is a nunber
of polarized particles large enough for the beam polarization to be detected externally, and fed
back to permit external control of the beam polarization. The level of achievable spin control,
though classical, not quantum mechanical, can be comparable to the control of one or a small number
of polarized particles in a low energy trap. Motivated to investigate time reversal invariance,
especially the detection of non-zero electric dipole moments (EDMs) this paper describes the design
of a low energy storage ring having the superimposed electric and magnetic bending needed to "freeze"
the spins of polarized beams. For electrons (of either sign) and protons the spins can be frozen with
all-electric bending but, in general, superimposed electric/magnetic bending is required. Since
constructive bending superposition in one direction implies destructive superposition in the
other direction, counter-circulating beams must differ, either in particle type or momentum,
in order for their orbits to be identical. For globally frozen spin operation the bunch polarizations
remain constant relative to the momenta, for example remaining parallel to the circuating beam
momentum vectors. With superimposed electric and magnetic bending, the globally frozen spin condition
can be met over a continua (specific to particle type) of E/B ratios. When this condition is met, the
out-of-plane, EDM-induced precession accumulates monitonically, which is obligatory for producing
a measurably large EDM signal. As Koop has explained, the EDM signal will still accumulate if the
polarization is allowed to "roll like a wheel" around a radial axis.

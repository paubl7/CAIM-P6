To characterize the role of the microstructure and crystal-preferred orientation (CPO) on the
deformation of mantle rocks, we performed axial extension experiments at 1200C and 300 MPa confining
pressure on three natural upper mantle peridotites: a fine-grained mylonitic harzburgite with
a weak olivine CPO and two coarse-grained well-equilibrated dunites with olivine CPO of variable
intensity. Despite the contrasting initial microstructure and olivine CPO, yield stresses show
a limited range of variation (115-165 MPa). Fine and coarse-grained peridotites show nevertheless
different evolutions of both mechanical behavior and microstructure. In the fine-grained harzburgite
necking produced decrease of the apparent differential stress. The olivine CPO intensity and recrystallized
fraction increase and the recrystallized grain size decreases towards the neck. Analysis of the
stresses and strains in the neck points to softening due to the evolution of the microstructure and
CPO. In contrast, necking of the coarse-grained dunite samples was not systematically accompanied
by decrease in apparent differential stress. This implies hardening, consistently with the increase
in bulk intragranular misorientation with increasing strain in these samples. All coarse-grained
dunites displayed a heterogeneous deformation. Crystals well oriented to deform by dislocation
glide became elongated and developed marked undulose extinction, whereas crystals in hard orientations
remained almost undeformed. In the neck, stress and strain concentration (up to 365 MPa and 240%)
resulted in formation of kinks in hard crystals, dynamic recrystallization in soft crystals and
finally development of extensional fractures. We interpret the more effective softening of the
fine-grained sample as due to easier dynamic recrystallization, probably due to the higher proportion
of grain boundaries acting as nucleation sites.

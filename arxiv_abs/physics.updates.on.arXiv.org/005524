The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major crisis that has significantly affected
the healthcare sector and global economies, which made it the main subject of various fields in scientific
and technical research. To properly understand and control this new epidemic, mathematical modelling
is presented as a very effective tool that can illustrate the mechanisms of its propagation. In this
regard, the use of compartmental models is the most prominent approach adopted in the literature
to describe the dynamics of COVID-19. Along the same line, we aim during this study to generalize
and ameliorate many existing works that consecrated to analyse the behaviour of this epidemic.
Precisely, we propose an SQEAIHR epidemic system for Coronavirus. Our constructed model is enriched
by taking into account the media intervention and vital dynamics. By the use of the next-generation
matrix method, the theoretical basic reproductive number $R_0$ is obtained for COVID-19. Based
on some nonstandard and generalized analytical techniques, the local and global stability of the
disease-free equilibrium are proven when $R_0 < 1$. Moreover, in the case of $R_0 > 1$, the uniform
persistence of COVID-19 model is also shown. In order to better adapt our epidemic model to reality,
the randomness factor is taken into account by considering a proportional white noises, which leads
to a well-posed stochastic model. Under appropriate conditions, interesting asymptotic properties
are proved, namely: extinction and persistence in the mean. The theoretical results show that the
dynamics of the perturbed COVID-19 model are determined by parameters that are closely related
to the magnitude of the stochastic noise. Finally, we present some numerical illustrations to confirm
our theoretical results and to show the impact of media intervention and quarantine strategies.

Computational fluid dynamics plays a key role in the design process across many industries. Recently,
there has been increasing interest in data-driven methods, in order to exploit the large volume
of data generated by such computations. This paper introduces the idea of using spatially correlated
polynomial ridge functions for rapid flowfield estimation. Dimension reducing ridge functions
are obtained for numerous points within training flowfields. The functions can then be used to predict
flow variables for new, previously unseen, flowfields. Their dimension reducing nature alleviates
the problems associated with visualising high dimensional datasets, enabling improved understanding
of design spaces and potentially providing valuable physical insights. The proposed framework
is computationally efficient; consisting of either readily parallelisable tasks, or linear algebra
operations. To further reduce the computational cost, ridge functions need only be computed at
only a small number of subsampled locations. The flow physics encoded within covariance matrices
obtained from the training flowfields can then be used to predict flow quantities, conditional
upon those predicted by the ridge functions at the sampled points. To demonstrate the efficacy of
the framework, the incompressible flow around an ensemble of aerofoils is used as a test case. On
unseen aerofoils the ridge functions' predictive accuracy is found to be reasonably competitive
with a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN). The local ridge functions can also
be reused to obtain surrogate models for integral quantities such a loss coefficient, which is advantageous
in situations where long-term storage of the CFD data is problematic. Finally, use of the ridge framework
with varying boundary conditions is demonstrated on a three dimensional transonic wing flow.

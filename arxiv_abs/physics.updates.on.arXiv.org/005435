One of the major problems in the study of the dynamics of proteins is the visualization of changing
conformations that are important for processes ranging from enzyme catalysis to signaling. A protein
exhibiting conformational dynamics is the soluble blood protein beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI),
which exists in two conformations: the closed (circular) form and the open (linear) form. It is hypothesized
that an increased proportion of the open conformation leads to the autoimmune disease antiphospholipid
syndrome (APS). A characteristic feature of beta2GPI is the high content of lysine residues. However,
the potential role of lysine in the conformational dynamics of beta2GPI has been poorly investigated.
Here, we report on a strategy to permanently open up the closed protein conformation by chemical
acetylation of lysine residues using acetic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS-Ac). Specific
and complete acetylation was demonstrated by the quantification of primary amino groups with fluoraldehyde
o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent, as well as western blot analysis with an anti-acetylated lysine
antibody. Our results demonstrate that acetylated beta2GPI preserves its secondary and tertiary
structures, as shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy. We found that after lysine acetylation,
the majority of proteins are in the open conformation as revealed by atomic force microscopy high-resolution
images. Using this strategy, we proved that the electrostatic interaction of lysine residues plays
a major role in stabilizing the beta2GPI closed conformation, as confirmed by lysine charge distribution
calculations. We foresee that our approach will be applied to other lysine-rich proteins (e.g.
histones) undergoing conformational transitions.

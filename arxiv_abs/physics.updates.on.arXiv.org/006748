A classical model of the electron based on Maxwell's equations is presented in which the wave character
is described by classical physics. Most properties follow from the description of a classical massless
charge circulating with v\,=\,c. The magnetic moment of the electron yields the radius of this circulation
and the generated synchrotron radiation removes the singularity of the Coulomb field and generates
the mass of the electron. Quantum mechanics yields its size and the angular moment. The fine structure
constant $\alpha$ compares this dynamic structure of the electron with the classical point-like
static view. This configuration is not stable. It will decay by the emission of synchrotron radiation.
The stability of this description is therefor investigated by extending this model to 3 dimensions.
The field lines within the free electromagnetic fields of the creation process, solved in polar
coordinates, yield possible tracks for a massless charge. Many possible circulating tracks are
found but only a combination of background fields yield environments in which stable tracks for
$\beta =1$ - charges may be created. Knotted toroidal tracks yield the stability. A knotted field
line e.g. with T(3,2)-symmetry may describe a spin-1/3-particle and a field line with T(2,3)-symmetry
in form of a knotted trefoil may belong to an electron as a stable spin-1/2-particle. With its fixed
internal revolution frequency this electron appears to the external world as a standing wave with
an amplitude propagating like the de Broglie wave. \noindent\rule{0mm}{5mm} {\bf Keywords}~~

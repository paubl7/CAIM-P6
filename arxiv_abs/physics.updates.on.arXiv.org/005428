In a previous study, students' self-expressed learning orientations towards an exercise centered
on self-monitoring one's ability to solve a pre-lab physics problem were identified from a post-test
feedback survey given to an introductory algebra-based physics student population spanning six
measured semesters, and examined as a potential variable in course performance, force and motion
conceptual understanding, and attitudes towards learning physics. The sampled population, which
primarily consists of life science majors, was also asked in the same feedback survey to discuss
what portion or portions of the course were relevant to their respective choices of major. In this
study, we examine the fact that about 50 students out of 218 sampled students, or 23% of the sample
population, explicitly stated that they perceived no relevance at all of the course to their respective
majors, whereas the other 168 students cited portions of the course or the entirety of the course
as being relevant to their majors. A follow-up investigation of perceived relevance versus irrelevance
shows that attitudes towards physics will experience more expert-like shifts for students who
perceive relevance than students who do not; in particular, the attitudinal survey's item clusters
that pertain to personal interest and real-world connections appear to show the strongest effect.
Further examination showed that biology majors and health science majors (two distinctive sub-populations
of life science majors) show similar pre-post trends for relevance vs. irrelevance perceptions,
whereas students with a performance achievement goal appeared to bifurcate between a novice-like
shift for perceived irrelevance and no attitudinal shift from pre to post for perceived relevance.
Discussion includes emphasis on limitations imposed by institution type among other factors.

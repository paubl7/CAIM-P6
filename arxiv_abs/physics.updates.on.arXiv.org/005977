A couple of dozen Earth-like planets orbiting M dwarfs have been discovered so far. Some of them have
attracted interest because of their potential long-term habitability; such a possibility is currently
vigorously debated in the literature. I show that post-Keplerian (pK) orbit precessions may impact
the habitability of a fictitious telluric planet orbiting an oblate late-type M dwarf of spectral
class M9V with $M_\star=0.08\,M_\odot$ at $a=0.02\,\mathrm{au}$, corresponding to an orbital
period $P_\mathrm{b}\simeq 4\,\mathrm{d}$, inducing long-term variations of the planetary
obliquity $\varepsilon$ which, under certain circumstances, may not be deemed as negligible from
the point of view of life's sustainability. I resume the analytical orbit-averaged equations of
the pK precessions, both classical and general relativistic, of the unit vectors $\boldsymbol{\hat{S}},\,\boldsymbol{\hat{h}}$
of both the planet's spin and orbital angular momenta $\boldsymbol S,\,\boldsymbol{L}$ entering
$\varepsilon$, and numerically integrate them by producing time series of the pK changes $\Delta\varepsilon(t)$
of the obliquity. For rapidly rotating M dwarfs with rotational periods of the order of $P_\star
\simeq 0.1-1\,\mathrm{d}$, the planet's obliquity $\varepsilon$ can undergo classical pK large
variations $\Delta\varepsilon(t)$ up to tens of degrees over timescales $\Delta t \simeq 20-200\,\mathrm{kyr}$,
depending on the mutual orientations of the star's spin ${\boldsymbol J}_\star$, of $\boldsymbol
S$, and of $\boldsymbol L$. Instead, $\Delta\varepsilon(t)$ are $\lesssim 1-1.5^\circ$ for the
planet b of the Teegarden's Star. In certain circumstances, the M dwarf's oblateness $J_2^\star$
should be considered as one of the key dynamical features to be taken into account in compiling budgets
of the long-term habitability of rocky planets around fast spinning late M dwarfs. (Abridged)

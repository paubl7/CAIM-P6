Recent developments in imaging techniques and correlation algorithms enable measurement of strain
fields on a deforming material at high spatial and temporal resolution. In such cases, the computation
of the stress field from the known deformation field becomes an interesting possibility. This is
known as an inverse problem. Current approaches to this problem, such as the finite element update
method, are generally over-determined and must rely on statistical approaches to minimize error.
This provides approximate solutions in some cases, however, implementation difficulties, computational
requirements, and accuracy are still significant challenges. Here, we show how the inverse problem
can be formulated deterministically and solved exactly in two or three dimensions for large classes
of materials including isotropic elastic solids, Newtonian fluids, non-Newtonian fluids, granular
materials and isotropic plastic solids. This solution is based on a single assumption of the alignment
of the principal directions of stress and strain or strain rate. No further assumptions regarding
incompressibility, pressure independence, yield surface shape or the hardening law are necessary.
This assumption leads to a closed, first order, linear system of hyperbolic partial differential
equations with variable coefficients and can be solved to give the solution for any geometry and
loading condition. We provide a numerical proof-of-principle study of the plastic deformation
of a two-dimensional bar with spatially varying yield stress and strain hardening coefficient.
The results are validated indicating the solution is exact up to numerical error. No model calibration
or material parameters are required. Interestingly, this solution procedure lends itself to a
simple physical interpretation of stress propagation through the material.

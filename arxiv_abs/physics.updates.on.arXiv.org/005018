Purpose: Organ-at-risk (OAR) delineation is a key step for cone-beam CT (CBCT) based adaptive radiotherapy
planning that can be a time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subject-to-variability process.
We aim to develop a fully automated approach aided by synthetic MRI for rapid and accurate CBCT multi-organ
contouring in head-and-neck (HN) cancer patients. MRI has superb soft-tissue contrasts, while
CBCT offers bony-structure contrasts. Using the complementary information provided by MRI and
CBCT is expected to enable accurate multi-organ segmentation in HN cancer patients. In our proposed
method, MR images are firstly synthesized using a pre-trained cycle-consistent generative adversarial
network given CBCT. The features of CBCT and synthetic MRI are then extracted using dual pyramid
networks for final delineation of organs. CBCT images and their corresponding manual contours
were used as pairs to train and test the proposed model. Quantitative metrics including Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) were used to evaluate the proposed method. The proposed method was evaluated
on a cohort of 65 HN cancer patients. CBCT images were collected from those patients who received
proton therapy. Overall, DSC values of 0.87, 0.79/0.79, 0.89/0.89, 0.90, 0.75/0.77, 0.86, 0.66,
0.78/0.77, 0.96, 0.89/0.89, 0.832, and 0.84 for commonly used OARs for treatment planning including
brain stem, left/right cochlea, left/right eye, larynx, left/right lens, mandible, optic chiasm,
left/right optic nerve, oral cavity, left/right parotid, pharynx, and spinal cord, respectively,
were achieved. In this study, we developed a synthetic MRI-aided HN CBCT auto-segmentation method
based on deep learning. It provides a rapid and accurate OAR auto-delineation approach, which can
be used for adaptive radiation therapy.

In several diagnosis and therapy procedures based on electrostimulation effect, the internal
physical quantity related to the stimulation is the induced electric field. To estimate the induced
electric field in an individual human model, the segmentation of anatomical imaging, such as (magnetic
resonance image (MRI) scans, of the corresponding body parts into tissues is required. Then, electrical
properties associated with different annotated tissues are assigned to the digital model to generate
a volume conductor. An open question is how segmentation accuracy of different tissues would influence
the distribution of the induced electric field. In this study, we applied parametric segmentation
of different tissues to exploit the segmentation of available MRI to generate different quality
of head models using deep learning neural network architecture, named ForkNet. Then, the induced
electric field are compared to assess the effect of model segmentation variations. Computational
results indicate that the influence of segmentation error is tissue-dependent. In brain, sensitivity
to segmentation accuracy is relatively high in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), moderate in gray matter
(GM) and low in white matter for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical
stimulation (tES). A CSF segmentation accuracy reduction of 10% in terms of Dice coefficient (DC)
lead to decrease up to 4% in normalized induced electric field in both applications. However, a GM
segmentation accuracy reduction of 5.6% DC leads to increase of normalized induced electric field
up to 6%. Opposite trend of electric field variation was found between CSF and GM for both TMS and tES.
The finding obtained here would be useful to quantify potential uncertainty of computational results.

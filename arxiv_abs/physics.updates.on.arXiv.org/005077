Purpose: This paper proposes a methodology and a computational tool to study the COVID-19 pandemic
throughout the world and to perform a trend analysis to assess its local dynamics. Methods: Mathematical
functions are employed to describe the number of cases and demises in each region and to predict their
final numbers, as well as the dates of maximum daily occurrences and the local stabilization date.
The model parameters are calibrated using a computational methodology for numerical optimization.
Trend analyses are run, allowing to assess the effects of public policies. Easy to interpret metrics
over the quality of the fitted curves are provided. Country-wise data from the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) concerning the daily number of cases and demises around the
world are used, as well as detailed data from Johns Hopkins University and from the Brasil.io project
describing individually the occurrences in United States counties and in Brazilian states and
cities, respectively. U. S. and Brazil were chosen for a more detailed analysis because they are
the current foci of the pandemic. Results: Illustrative results for different countries, U. S.
counties and Brazilian states and cities are presented and discussed. Conclusion: The main contributions
of this work lie in (i) a straightforward model of the curves to represent the data, which allows automation
of the process without requiring interventions from experts; (ii) an innovative approach for trend
analysis, whose results provide important information to support authorities in their decision-making
process; and (iii) the developed computational tool, which is freely available and allows the user
to quickly update the COVID-19 analyses and forecasts for any country, United States county or Brazilian
state or city present in the periodic reports from the authorities.

Accurate low dimension chemical kinetic models for methane are an essential component in the design
of efficient gas turbine combustors. Kinetic models coupled to computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
provide quick and efficient ways to test the effect of operating conditions, fuel composition and
combustor design compared to physical experiments. However, detailed chemical kinetic models
are too computationally expensive for use in CFD. We propose a novel data orientated three-step
methodology to produce compact models that replicate a target set of detailed model properties
to a high fidelity. In the first step, a reduced kinetic model is obtained by removing all non-essential
species from the detailed model containing 118 species using path flux analysis (PFA). It is then
numerically optimised to replicate the detailed model's prediction in two rounds; First, to selected
species (OH,H,CO and CH4) profiles in perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) simulations and then re-optimised
to the detailed model's prediction of the laminar flame speed. This is implemented by a purposely
developed Machine Learned Optimisation of Chemical Kinetics (MLOCK) algorithm. The MLOCK algorithm
systematically perturbs all three Arrhenius parameters for selected reactions and assesses the
suitability of the new parameters through an objective error function which quantifies the error
in the compact model's calculation of the optimisation target. This strategy is demonstrated through
the production of a 19 species and a 15 species compact model for methane/air combustion. Both compact
models are validated across a range of 0D and 1D calculations across both lean and rich conditions
and shows good agreement to the parent detailed mechanism. The 15 species model is shown to outperform
the current state-of-art models in both accuracy and range of conditions the model is valid over.

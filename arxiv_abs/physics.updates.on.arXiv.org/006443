Laboratory plasmas in open magnetic geometries can be found in many different applications such
as (1) Scrape-Of-Layer (SOL) and divertor regions in toroidal confinement fusion devices (\approx1-10^2\hspace{1mm}\mathrm{eV}),
(2) linear divertor simulators (\approx1-10\hspace{1mm}\mathrm{eV}), (3) plasma-based thrusters
(\approx10\hspace{1mm}\mathrm{eV}) and (4) magnetic mirrors (\approx10^2-10^3\hspace{1mm}\mathrm{eV}).
A common feature of these plasma systems is the need to resolve, in addition to velocity space, at
least one physical dimension (e.g. along flux lines) to capture the relevant physics. In general,
this requires a kinetic treatment. Fully kinetic Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations can be applied
but at the expense of large computational effort. A common way to resolve this is to use a hybrid approach:
kinetic ions and fluid electrons. In the present work, the development of a hybrid PIC computational
tool suitable for open magnetic geometries is described which includes (1) the effect of non-uniform
magnetic fields, (2) finite fully-absorbing boundaries for the particles and (3) volumetric particle
sources. Analytical expressions for the momentum transport in the paraxial limit are presented
with their underlying assumptions and are used to validate the results from the PIC simulations.
The self-consistent electric field is calculated and is shown to modify the ion velocity distribution
function in manner consistent with analytic theory. Based on this analysis, the ion distribution
function is understood in terms of a loss-cone distribution and an isotropic Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution driven by a volumetric plasma source. Finally, inclusion of a Monte-Carlo based Fokker-Planck
collision operator is discussed in the context of future work.

Recently, Nadir and Occultation for Mars Discovery (NOMAD) ultraviolet and visible spectrometer
instrument on board the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) simultaneously
measured the limb emission intensities for both [OI] 2972 and 5577 {\AA} (green) emissions in the
dayside of Martian upper atmosphere. We aim to explore the photochemistry of all these forbidden
atomic oxygen emissions ([OI] 2972, 5577, 6300, 6464 {\AA}) in the Martian daylight upper atmosphere
and suitable conditions for the simultaneous detection of these emissions lines in the dayside
visible spectra. A photochemical model is developed to study the production and loss processes
of O(1S) and O(1D) by incorporating various chemical reactions of different O-bearing species
in the upper atmosphere of Mars. By reducing Fox (2004) modelled neutral density profiles by a factor
of 2, the calculated limb intensity profiles for [OI] 5577 and 2972 {\AA} emissions are found to be
consistent with the NOMAD-TGO observations. In this case, at altitudes below 120 km, our modelled
limb intensity for [OI] 6300 {\AA} emission is smaller by a factor 2 to 5 compared to that of NOMAD-TGO
observation for [OI] 2972 {\AA} emission, and above this distance it is comparable with the upper
limit of the observation. We studied various parameters which can influence the limb intensities
of these atomic oxygen forbidden emission lines. Our calculated limb intensity for [OI] 6300 {\AA}
emission, when the Mars is at near perihelion and for solar maximum condition, suggests that all
these forbidden emissions should be observable in the NOMAD-TGO visible spectra taken on the dayside
of Martian upper atmosphere. More simultaneous observations of forbidden atomic oxygen emission
lines will help to understand the photochemical processes of oxygen-bearing species in the dayside
Martian upper atmosphere.

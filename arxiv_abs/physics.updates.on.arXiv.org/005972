Due to the applications in meteorological broadcasts, radio navigation and underwater communications,
low-frequency(LF) receiving antennas have been actively studied. However, because the frequency
range of LF antenna is 30kHz to 300kHz, its electromagnetic wavelength is 1km to 10km, which makes
LF electromagnetic antennas difficult to be implemented in miniaturized or portable devices.
This article presents a miniaturized LF magnetoelectric(ME) receiving antenna with an integrated
DC magnetic bias. The antenna is based on the magnetoelectric effect and operates by resonance at
its mechanical resonant frequency. Thus, compared with traditional LF wire antennas, the dimension
of ME antenna is reduced significantly. Compared with prior art of ME antennas which do not have DC
magnetic bias, higher performance can be achieved by integrating the miniaturized DC magnetic
bias. Besides, compared with prior art of a ME antenna with a Helmholtz coil to provide DC magnetic
bias, the integrated DC magnetic bias significantly reduces the dimension of the ME antenna. Magnetostrictive
TbDyFe2(Terfenol-D) and piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate(PZT) thin films are bonded together
to form the 38x12x5.8mm ME receiving antenna. Four 10x10x10mm Rb magnets are implemented to provide
an optimal DC bias for the antenna. A maximum operation distance of 160mm is demonstrated with the
DC magnetic field bias, 2.67 times of the maximum operation distance of the antenna without DC magnet
field bias. The performance of the ME receiving antenna are characterized under different rotation
and translation conditions with regards to a transmitting spiral coil antenna. The miniaturized
LF ME antenna could have potential applications in portable electronics, internet of things and
underwater communications.

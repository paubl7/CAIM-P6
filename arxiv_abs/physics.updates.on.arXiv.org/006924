This paper presents a novel finite-element approach for the electromagnetic modeling of superconducting
coated conductors. We combine a thin-shell (TS) method to the $H$-$\phi$ formulation to avoid the
meshing difficulties related to the high aspect ratio of these conductors and reduce the computational
burden in simulations. The interface boundary conditions in the TS method are defined using an auxiliary
1-D \textcolor{black}{finite-element} (FE) discretization of $N$ elements along the thinnest
dimension of the conductor. This procedure permits the approximation of the superconductor's
nonlinearities inside the TS in a time-transient analysis. Four application examples of increasing
complexity are discussed: (i) single coated conductor, (ii) two closely packed conductors carrying
anti-parallel currents, (iii) a stack of twenty superconducting tapes and a (iv) full representation
of a HTS tape comprising a stack of thin films. In all these examples, the \textcolor{black}{profiles}
of both the tangential and normal components of the magnetic field show good agreement with a reference
solution obtained with standard \textcolor{black}{$2$-D} $H$-$\phi$ formulation. Results
are also compared with the widely used $T$-$A$ formulation. This formulation is shown to be dual
to the TS model with a single FE ($N=1$) in the auxiliary 1-D systems. The increase of $N$ in the TS model
is shown to be advantageous at small inter-tape separation and low transport current since it allows
the tangential components of the magnetic field to penetrate the thin region. The reduction in computational
cost without compromising accuracy makes the proposed model promising for the simulation of large-scale
superconducting applications.

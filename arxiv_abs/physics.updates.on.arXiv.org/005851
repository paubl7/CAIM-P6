We explore the potential of feed-forward deep neural networks (DNNs) for emulating cloud superparameterization
in realistic geography, using offline fits to data from the Super Parameterized Community Atmospheric
Model. To identify a network architecture of greatest skill, we formally optimize its hyperparameters
using ~250 trials. Our DNN explains over 70 percent of the temporal variance at the 15-minute sampling
scale throughout the mid-to-upper troposphere. The spatial relationship between DNN skill and
autocorrelation timescale shows performance is weakest in the tropical, marine boundary layer.
Spectral analysis in the temporal domain indicates skillful emulation of signals on diurnal to
synoptic scales; a close look at the diurnal cycle reveals correct emulation of land-sea contrasts
and vertical structure in the heating and moistening fields, but some distortion of precipitation
emulation. Sensitivity tests targeting precipitation skill reveal complementary effects of
adding positive constraints vs. hyperparameter tuning, motivating the use of both in the future.
A first attempt to force an offline land model with DNN emulated atmospheric fields produces reassuring
results further suggesting neural network emulation viability in real-geography settings. Overall,
the fit skill is competitive with recent attempts by sophisticated Residual and Convolutional
Neural Network architectures trained on added information, including memory of past states. Our
results confirm the parameterizability of superparameterized convection in the presence of continents
through machine learning and we highlight advantages of casting this problem locally in space and
time for accurate emulation and hopefully quick implementation of hybrid climate models.

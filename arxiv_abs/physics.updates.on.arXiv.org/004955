Dynamic axial focusing functionality has recently experienced widespread incorporation in microscopy,
augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), adaptive optics, and material processing. However, the limitations
of existing varifocal tools continue to beset the performance capabilities and operating overhead
of the optical systems that mobilize such functionality. The varifocal tools that are the least
burdensome to drive (ex: liquid crystal, elastomeric or optofluidic lenses) suffer from low (~
100 Hz) refresh rates. Conversely, the fastest devices sacrifice either critical capabilities
such as their dwelling capacity (ex: acoustic gradient lenses or monolithic micromechanical mirrors)
or low operating overhead (e.g., deformable mirrors). Here, we present a general-purpose random-access
axial focusing device that bridges these previously conflicting features of high speed, dwelling
capacity and lightweight drive by employing low-rigidity micromirrors that exploit the robustness
of defocusing phase profiles. Geometrically, the device consists of an 8.2 mm diameter array of
piston-motion and 48 um-pitch micromirror pixels that provide 2pi phase shifting for wavelengths
shorter than 1 100 nm with 10-90 % settling in 64.8 us (i.e., 15.44 kHz refresh rate). The pixels are
electrically partitioned into 32 rings for a driving scheme that enables phase-wrapped operation
with circular symmetry and requires less than 30 V per channel. Optical experiments demonstrated
the array's wide focusing range with a measured ability to target 29 distinct, resolvable depth
planes. Overall, the features of the proposed array offer the potential for compact, straightforward
methods of tackling bottlenecked applications including high-throughput single-cell targeting
in neurobiology and the delivery of dense 3D visual information in AR/VR.

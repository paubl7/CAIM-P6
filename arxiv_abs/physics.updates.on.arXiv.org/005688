In silico, cell based approaches for modeling biological morphogenesis are used to test and validate
our understanding of the biological and mechanical process that are at work during the growth and
the organization of multi-cell tissues. As compared to in vivo experiments, computer based frameworks
dedicated to tissue modeling allow us to easily test different hypotheses, and to quantify the impact
of various biophysically relevant parameters. Here, we propose a formalism based on a detailed,
yet simple, description of cells that accounts for intra-, inter- and extra-cellular mechanisms.
More precisely, the cell growth and division is described through the space and time evolution of
the membrane vertices. These vertices follow a Newtonian dynamics, meaning that their evolution
is controlled by different types of forces: a membrane force (spring and bending), an adherence
force (inter cellular spring), external and internal pressure forces. In addition to the cells
dynamics, our formalism further relies on a lattice Boltzmann method, using the Palabos library,
to simulate the diffusion of chemical signals. The latter aims at driving the growth and migration
of a tissue by simply changing the state of the cells. All of this leads to an accurate description
of the growth and division of cells, with realistic cell shapes and where membranes can have different
properties. While this work is of methodological nature, we also propose to validate our framework
through simple, yet biologically relevant benchmark tests at both single-cell and full tissue
scales. This includes free and chemically controlled cell tissue growth in an unbounded domain.
The ability of our framework to simulate cell migration, cell compression and morphogenesis under
external constraints is also investigated in a qualitative manner.

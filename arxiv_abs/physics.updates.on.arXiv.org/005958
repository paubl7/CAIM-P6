Harvesting waste heat with temperatures lower than 100 oC can improve system efficiency and reduce
greenhouse gas emission, yet it has been a longstanding and challenging task. Electrochemical
methods for harvesting low-grade heat have attracted research interest in recent years due to the
relatively high effective temperature coefficient of the electrolytes (> 1 mV/K) compared with
the thermopower of traditional thermoelectric devices. Comparing with other electrochemical
devices such as temperature-variation based thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle and
temperature-difference based thermogalvanic cells, the thermally regenerative flow battery
(TRFB) has the advantages of providing a continuous power output, decoupling the heat source and
heat sink and recuperating heat, and compatible with stacking for scaling up. However, TRFB suffers
from the issue of stable operation due to the challenge of pH matching between catholyte and anolyte
solutions with desirable temperature coefficients. In this work, we demonstrate a PH-neutral
TRFB based on KI/KI_3 and K_3Fe(CN)_6/K_4Fe(CN)_6 as the catholyte and anolyte, respectively,
with a cell temperature coefficient of 1.9 mV/K and a power density of 9 {\mu}W/cm2. This work also
presents a comprehensive model with coupled analysis of mass transfer and reaction kinetics in
a porous electrode that can accurately capture the flow rate dependence of power density and energy
conversion efficiency. We estimate that the efficiency of the pH-neutral TRFB can reach 11% of the
Carnot efficiency at the maximum power output with a temperature difference of 37 K. Via analysis,
we identify that the mass transfer overpotential inside the porous electrode and the resistance
of the ion exchange membrane are the two major factors limiting the efficiency and power density,
pointing to directions for future improvements.

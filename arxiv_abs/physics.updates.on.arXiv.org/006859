Tropical precipitation clusters exhibit power-law frequency distributions in area and volume
(integrated precipitation), implying a lack of characteristic scale in tropical convective organization.
However, it remains unknown what gives rise to the power laws and how the power-law exponents for
area and volume are related to one another. Here, we explore the perspective that precipitation
clusters are islands above a convective threshold on a rough column-water-vapor (CWV) topography.
This perspective is supported by the agreement between the precipitation clusters and CWV islands
in their frequency distributions as well as fractal dimensions. Power laws exist for CWV islands
at different thresholds through the CWV topography, suggesting that the existence of power-laws
is not specifically related to local precipitation dynamics, but is rather a general feature of
CWV islands. Furthermore, the frequency distributions and fractal dimensions of the clusters
can be reproduced when the CWV field is modeled to be self-affine with a roughness exponent of 0.3.
Self-affine scaling theory relates the statistics of precipitation clusters to the roughness
exponent; it also relates the power-law slopes for area and volume without involving the roughness
exponent. Thus, the perspective of precipitation clusters as CWV islands provides a useful framework
to consider many statistical properties of the precipitation clusters, particularly given that
CWV is well-observed over a wide range of length scales in the tropics. However, the statistics of
CWV islands at the convective threshold imply a smaller roughness than is inferred from the power
spectrum of the bulk CWV field, and further work is needed to understand the scaling of the CWV field.

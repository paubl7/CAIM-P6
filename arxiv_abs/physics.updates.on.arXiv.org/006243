We propose two new methods to calibrate the parameters of the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence
(ETAS) model based on expectation maximization (EM) while accounting for temporal variation of
catalog completeness. The first method allows for model calibration on earthquake catalogs with
long history, featuring temporal variation of the magnitude of completeness, $m_c$. This extended
calibration technique is beneficial for long-term Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA),
which is often based on a mixture of instrumental and historical catalogs. The second method jointly
estimates ETAS parameters and high-frequency detection incompleteness to address the potential
biases in parameter calibration due to short-term aftershock incompleteness. For this, we generalize
the concept of completeness magnitude and consider a rate- and magnitude-dependent detection
probability $-$ embracing incompleteness instead of avoiding it. Using synthetic tests, we show
that both methods can accurately invert the parameters of simulated catalogs. We then use them to
estimate ETAS parameters for California using the earthquake catalog since 1932. To explore how
the newly gained information from the second method affects earthquakes' predictability, we conduct
pseudo-prospective forecasting experiments for California. Our proposed model significantly
outperforms the base ETAS model, and we find that the ability to include small earthquakes for simulation
of future scenarios is the main driver of the improvement. Our results point towards a preference
of earthquakes to trigger similarly sized aftershocks, which has potentially major implications
for our understanding of earthquake interaction mechanisms and for the future of seismicity forecasting.

Reliable predictions of the behaviour of chemical systems are essential across many industries,
from nanoscale engineering over validation of advanced materials to nanotoxicity assessment
in health and medicine. For the future we therefore envision a paradigm shift for the design of chemical
simulations across all length scales from a prescriptive to a predictive and quantitative science.
This paper presents an integrative perspective about the state-of-the-art of modelling in computational
and theoretical chemistry with examples from data- and equation-based models. Extension to include
reliable risk assessments and quality control are discussed. To specify and broaden the concept
of chemical accuracy in the design cycle of reliable and robust molecular simulations the fields
of computational chemistry, physics, mathematics, visualisation science, and engineering are
bridged. Methods from electronic structure calculations serve as examples to explain how uncertainties
arise: through assumed mechanisms in form of equations, model parameters, algorithms, and numerical
implementations. We provide a full classification of uncertainties throughout the chemical modelling
cycle and discuss how the associated risks can be mitigated. Further, we apply our statements to
molecular dynamics and partial differential equations based approaches. An overview of methods
from numerical mathematics and statistics provides strategies to analyse risks and potential
errors in the design of new materials and compounds. We also touch on methods for validation and verification.
In the conclusion we address cross-disciplinary open challenges. In future the quantitative analysis
of where simulations and their prognosis fail will open doors towards predictive materials engineering
and chemical modelling.

We present a simple but efficient concept for the realization of blended teaching of mathematics
and its applications in theoretical mechanics that was conceived, tested and implemented at the
University of Trento, Italy, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The concept foresees traditional blackboard
lectures with a reduced number of students present in the lecture hall, while the same lectures are
simultaneously made available to the remaining students via high quality low-bandwidth online
streaming. Based on our first assumption that traditional blackboard lectures, including the
gestures and the facial expressions of the professor, are still a very efficient and highly appreciated
means of teaching mathematics, this paper deliberately does not want to propose a novel pedagogical
concept of how to teach mathematics, but rather presents a technical concept how to preserve the
quality of traditional blackboard lectures even during the pandemic and how to make them available
to the students at home via online streaming with adequate audio and video quality at low internet
bandwidth. The second assumption is that the teaching of mathematics is a dynamic creative process
that requires the physical presence of students in the lecture hall as audience so that the professor
can instantaneously fine-tune the evolution of the lecture according to his/her perception of
the level of attention and the facial expressions of the students. The third assumption of this paper
is that students need to have the possibility to interact with each other personally. We report on
the necessary hardware, software and logistics, and on the perception of the proposed blended lectures
by students from civil and environmental engineering at the University of Trento, compared to traditional
lectures and also compared to the pure online lectures that were needed as emergency measure at the
beginning of the pandemic.

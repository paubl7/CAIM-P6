Effects of low-temperature chemistry induced by ultrafine water droplet evaporation on reaction
front development from an ignition spot with temperature gradient are studied in this work. The
Eulerian-Eulerian method is used to simulate the gas-liquid two-phase reactive flows and the physical
model is one-dimensional spherical reactor with stoichiometric gaseous n-heptane/air mixture
and ultrafine monodisperse water droplets (initial diameter 5 micrometres). Homogeneous ignitions
of two-phase mixtures are first simulated. The water droplets can complete evaporation in the reactor
prior to ignition, and hence pronouncedly reduce gas temperature, which may induce the low-chemistry
reactions. It is found that the turnover temperature for negative temperature coefficient range
increases with droplet volume fraction. Three-stage ignitions are present when the volume fraction
is beyond a critical value, i.e., low-temperature, intermediate-temperature, and high-temperature
ignitions. The chemical explosive mode analysis also confirms the low-chemistry reactions induced
by the evaporation of ultrafine water droplets. Then reaction front development from an ignition
spot with temperature gradient in two-phase mixtures is analysed based on one-dimensional simulations.
Different modes for reaction front origin in the spot are identified, based on the initial gas temperature
and lower turnover temperature. Specifically, the reaction front can be initiated at the left and
right ends of the ignition spot, and inside it. Detailed reaction front developments corresponding
to the above three modes are discussed. Besides, the pressure wave from high-temperature ignition
is important, compared to those from low- and intermediate-chemistries.

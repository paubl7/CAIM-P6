An exceptional point (EP) is a branch singularity where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a parametric
non-Hermitian operator coalesce. This work studies EPs associated with different operators in
phononic crystals (PC) and the related phenomena. The questions of existence of EPs and their physical
manifestations will be addressed with particular focus on symmetry considerations and scattering
behavior. Discrete spring-mass models with adjustable parameters are used here to elucidate the
discussion in a fundamental form. Specific phenomena associated with EPs in the eigenfrequency
band structure, including level repulsion, mode switching, and self-orthogonality are briefly
presented. General formulas of the transfer and scattering matrices are used for 1D linear discrete
systems to provide practical insights on the effects of reciprocity and fundamental symmetries.
We explicitly address the effects of reciprocity,~$\mathcal{P}$,~$\mathcal{T}$, and~$\pt$
symmetries on the transfer and scattering matrices. We present two special scattering examples,
which are associated with the EPs of the dynamic matrix and scattering matrix, respectively. In
the first case, a specimen may be tuned to become completely undetectable from both directions at
a certain frequency. In the second case, the sample possesses~$\pt$ symmetry and features one-way
reflection. The EPs of its scattering matrix are associated with phase transitions and spontaneous
symmetry breaking. This theoretical study of EPs in mechanical context will translate fundamental
understandings of the related phenomena gained in quantum mechanics. The expansion to mechanical
systems is then used to suggest novel applications of micro-structured media such as wave filtering
and robust sensing.

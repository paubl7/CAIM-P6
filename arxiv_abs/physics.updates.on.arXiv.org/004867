To understand how internal flow structures manifest themselves in the global heat transfer, we
study the correlation between different flow modes and the instantaneous Nusselt number ($Nu$)
in a two-dimensional square Rayleigh-B\'enard convection cell. High-resolution and long-time
direct numerical simulations are carried out for Rayleigh number between $10^{7}$ and $10^{9}$
and Prandtl number of 5.3. The investigated Nusselt numbers include the volume-averaged $Nu_{\text{vol}}$,
the wall-averaged $Nu_{\text{wall}}$, the kinetic energy dissipation based $Nu_{\text{kinetic}}$
and the thermal energy dissipation based $Nu_{\text{thermal}}$. The Fourier mode decomposition
and proper orthogonal decomposition are adopted to extract the coherent flow structure. Our results
show that the single-roll mode, the horizontally stacked double-roll mode, and the quadrupolar
flow mode are more efficient for heat transfer on average. In contrast, the vertically stacked double
roll mode is inefficient for heat transfer on average. The volume-averaged $Nu_{\text{vol}}$
and the kinetic energy dissipation based $Nu_{\text{kinetic}}$ can better reproduce the correlation
of internal flow structure with heat transfer efficiency than that of the wall-averaged $Nu_{\text{wall}}$
and the thermal energy dissipation based $Nu_{\text{thermal}}$, even though these four Nusselt
numbers give consistent time-averaged mean values. The ensemble-averaged time trace of $Nu$ during
flow reversal shows that only the volume-averaged $Nu_{\text{vol}}$ can reproduce the overshoot
phenomena that is observed in the previous experimental study. Our results reveal that the proper
choice of the $Nu$ is critical to obtain a meaningful interpretation.

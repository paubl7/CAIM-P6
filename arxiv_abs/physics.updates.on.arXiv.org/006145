Motivated by recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations of "switchbacks" (abrupt, large-amplitude
reversals in the radial magnetic field, which exhibit Alfv\'enic correlations) we examine the
dynamics of large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves in the expanding solar wind. We develop an analytic
model which makes several predictions: switchbacks should preferentially occur in regions where
the solar wind plasma has undergone a greater expansion, the switchback fraction at radii comparable
to PSP should be an increasing function of radius, and switchbacks should have their gradients preferentially
perpendicular to the mean magnetic field direction. The expansion of the plasma generates small
compressive components as part of the wave's nonlinear evolution: these are maximized when the
normalized fluctuation amplitude is comparable to $\sin\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between
the propagation direction and the mean magnetic field. These compressive components steepen the
primary Alfv\'enic waveform, keeping the solution in a state of nearly constant magnetic field
strength as its normalized amplitude $\delta B/B$ grows due to expansion. The small fluctuations
in the magnetic-field-strength are minimized at a particular $\theta$-dependent value of $\beta$,
usually of order unity, and the density and magnetic-field-strength fluctuations can be correlated
or anticorrelated depending on $\beta$ and $\theta$. Example solutions of our dynamical equation
are presented; some do indeed form magnetic-field reversals. Our predictions appear to match some
previously unexplained phenomena in observations and numerical simulations, providing evidence
that the observed switchbacks result from the nonlinear evolution of the initially small-amplitude
Alfv\'en waves already known to be present at the coronal base.

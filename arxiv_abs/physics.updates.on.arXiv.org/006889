Classically encountered problem of acceleration runaway in radiative motion of a charged-particle
is addressed by considering the criterion of minimum radiation loss under optimum displacement
in variationally referred dynamic course in between a pair of arbitrarily selected space-like
surfaces having time-like separation. Using the criterion, analysis made by involving a family
of infinitesimally differed paths reveals that for attaining stationary action of the dynamic
course it is necessary to involve orchestrated displacement of the path family. Dynamics that generally
follows from such analysis involves nonlocally mediated interaction besides the conventional
ones. Amidst external field perturbation it is shown that ubiquitous nonlocal mediation incessantly
attempts optimizing displacement in accomplishing minimum radiation loss. The mediation involves
virtual exchange of quantized energy and momentum of the interacting field and particle, which
in conformity with quantum mechanical prescription is describable by unitary evolution. Under
increasingly high perturbation, the mediation can boost its defensive effort but up to a critical
limit with stress release predominantly as Larmor radiation relaxation. Observable acceleration
and jerk, and relaxations thereof in the nonstationary evolution are indeed markers of the defense
failure. Recoil from the Larmor relaxation impedes kinetic energy growth and also imparts shear
stress to the spherically polarized vacuum field of point charge; the transverse stress release
having similitude of Hawking-Unruh radiation. Defending nonlocal field restrains acceleration
runaway and loss of causality. The classically based ab-initio analysis on nonlocal realisms further
proves its versatility in revealing nonlocally mediated geodesics structure of quantized 4-space
with useful revelations.

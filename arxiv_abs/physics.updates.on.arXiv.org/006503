Pulmonary respiratory motion artifacts are common in four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT)
of lungs and are caused by missing, duplicated, and misaligned image data. This paper presents a
geodesic density regression (GDR) algorithm to correct motion artifacts in 4DCT by correcting
artifacts in one breathing phase with artifact-free data from corresponding regions of other breathing
phases. The GDR algorithm estimates an artifact-free lung template image and a smooth, dense, 4D
(space plus time) vector field that deforms the template image to each breathing phase to produce
an artifact-free 4DCT scan. Correspondences are estimated by accounting for the local tissue density
change associated with air entering and leaving the lungs, and using binary artifact masks to exclude
regions with artifacts from image regression. The artifact-free lung template image is generated
by mapping the artifact-free regions of each phase volume to a common reference coordinate system
using the estimated correspondences and then averaging. This procedure generates a fixed view
of the lung with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. The GDR algorithm was evaluated and compared
to a state-of-the-art geodesic intensity regression (GIR) algorithm using simulated CT time-series
and 4DCT scans with clinically observed motion artifacts. The simulation shows that the GDR algorithm
has achieved significantly more accurate Jacobian images and sharper template images, and is less
sensitive to data dropout than the GIR algorithm. We also demonstrate that the GDR algorithm is more
effective than the GIR algorithm for removing clinically observed motion artifacts in treatment
planning 4DCT scans. Our code is freely available at https://github.com/Wei-Shao-Reg/GDR.

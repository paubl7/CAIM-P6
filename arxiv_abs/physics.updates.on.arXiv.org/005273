This work presents a review and perspectives on recent developments in the use of machine learning
(ML) to augment Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models
of turbulent flows. Different approaches of applying supervised learning to represent unclosed
terms, model discrepancies and sub-filter scales are discussed in the context of RANS and LES modeling.
Particular emphasis is placed on the impact of the training procedure on the consistency of ML augmentations
with the underlying physical model. Techniques to promote model-consistent training, and to avoid
the requirement of full fields of direct numerical simulation data are detailed. This is followed
by a discussion of physics-informed and mathematical considerations on the choice of the feature
space, and imposition of constraints on the ML model. With a view towards developing generalizable
ML-augmented RANS and LES models, outstanding challenges are discussed, and perspectives are
provided. While the promise of ML-augmented turbulence modeling is clear, and successes have been
demonstrated in isolated scenarios, a general consensus of this paper is that truly generalizable
models require model-consistent training with careful characterization of underlying assumptions
and imposition of physically and mathematically informed priors and constraints to account for
the inevitable shortage of data relevant to predictions of interest. Thus, machine learning should
be viewed as one tool in the turbulence modeler's toolkit. This modeling endeavor requires multi-disciplinary
advances, and thus the target audience for this paper is the fluid mechanics community, as well as
the computational science and machine learning communities.

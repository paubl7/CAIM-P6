Uncertainty is ubiquitous with flow in subsurface rocks because of their inherent heterogeneity
and lack of in-situ measurements. To complete uncertainty analysis in a multi-scale manner, it
is a prerequisite to provide sufficient rock samples. Even though the advent of digital rock technology
offers opportunities to reproduce rocks, it still cannot be utilized to provide massive samples
due to its high cost, thus leading to the development of diversified mathematical methods. Among
them, two-point statistics (TPS) and multi-point statistics (MPS) are commonly utilized, which
feature incorporating low-order and high-order statistical information, respectively. Recently,
generative adversarial networks (GANs) are becoming increasingly popular since they can reproduce
training images with excellent visual and consequent geologic realism. However, standard GANs
can only incorporate information from data, while leaving no interface for user-defined properties,
and thus may limit the representativeness of reconstructed samples. In this study, we propose conditional
GANs for digital rock reconstruction, aiming to reproduce samples not only similar to the real training
data, but also satisfying user-specified properties. In fact, the proposed framework can realize
the targets of MPS and TPS simultaneously by incorporating high-order information directly from
rock images with the GANs scheme, while preserving low-order counterparts through conditioning.
We conduct three reconstruction experiments, and the results demonstrate that rock type, rock
porosity, and correlation length can be successfully conditioned to affect the reconstructed
rock images. Furthermore, in contrast to existing GANs, the proposed conditioning enables learning
of multiple rock types simultaneously, and thus invisibly saves computational cost.

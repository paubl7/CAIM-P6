The purpose of marine seismic experiments is to provide information of the physical properties
of the subsurface. The p-wave velocity distribution is the most important attribute, commonly
obtained by tomography of waveform attributes. Wide-angle reflection/refraction arrivals,
typically collected in Ocean Bottom Seismometers experiments, are used to image relatively deep
structures typically providing low redundancy and limited resolution velocity models. The shallow
subsurface is classically studied with Multi-Channel Seismic data collected in streamers. In
this case, the recording of refractions as first arrivals is limited primarily by the streamer length
and geological features like water depth and p-wave structure, but also a considerable amount of
the refractions are masked by reflections and noise. However, MCS data of variable quality are available
in many regions where no other data exist to build a velocity model. Thus, it is essential to extract
the arrival information with the highest possible quality and reliability. To enhance refraction
information in MCS data, the downward continuation technique providing the redatuming of streamer
field data to the seafloor has been proven useful. In this new virtual configuration, the early refractions
transform to first arrivals, becoming clearly visible from zero offset. However, there is little
literature, let alone available codes, to use with the large available MCS data bases. This work
presents a user friendly open source HPC software for redatuming 2D streamer field data to the seafloor.
The main ingredient is the acoustic wave equation used backward in time, allowing first the redatuming
of the receivers, and after, the redatuming of the sources. Also, assessment tools are provided
to evaluate the information available after redatumed for a specific streamer field data set.

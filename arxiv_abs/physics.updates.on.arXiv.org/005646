In order to understand the complex cognitive functions of the human brain, it is essential to study
the structural connectome, i.e., the wiring of different brain regions to each other through axonal
pathways. However, the high degree of plasticity and cross-population variability in human brains
makes it difficult to relate structure to function, motivating a search for invariant patterns
in the connectivity. At the same time, variability within a population can provide information
about generative mechanisms. In this paper we analyze the connection topology and link-weight
distribution of human structural connectomes obtained from a database comprising 196 subjects.
By demonstrating a correspondence between the occurrence frequency of individual links and their
average weight across the population, we show that the process by which the brain is wired is not independent
of the process by which the link weights of the connectome are determined. Furthermore, using the
specific distribution of the weights associated with each link over the entire population, we show
that a single parameter that is specific to a link can account for its frequency of occurrence, as
well as, the variation in its weight across different subjects. This parameter provides a basis
for ``rescaling'' the link weights in each connectome, allowing us to obtain a generic network representative
of the human brain, distinct from a simple average over the connectomes. We obtain functional connectomes
by implementing a neural mass model on each of the vertices of the corresponding structural connectomes.
By comparing with the empirical functional brain networks, we demonstrate that the rescaling procedure
yields a closer structure-function correspondence. Finally, we show that the representative
network can be decomposed into a basal component that is stable across the population and a highly
variable superstructure.

Excited state electron and hole transfer underpin fundamental steps in processes such as exciton
dissociation at photovoltaic heterojunctions, photoinduced charge transfer at electrodes,
and electron transfer in photosynthetic reaction centers. Diabatic states corresponding to charge
or excitation localized species, such as locally excited and charge transfer states, provide a
physically intuitive framework to simulate and understand these processes. However, obtaining
accurate diabatic states and their couplings from adiabatic electronic states generally leads
to inaccurate results when combined with low-tier electronic structure methods, such as time dependent
density functional theory (TDDFT), and exorbitant computational cost when combined with high-level
wavefunction-based methods. Here we introduce a DFT-based diabatization scheme, {\Delta}-ALMO(MSDFT2),
which directly constructs the diabatic states using absolutely localized molecular orbitals
(ALMOs). We demonstrate that our method, which combines ALMO calculations with the {\Delta}SCF
technique to construct electronically excited diabatic states and obtains their couplings with
charge-transfer states using our MSDFT2 scheme, gives accurate results for excited state electron
and hole transfer in both charged and uncharged systems that underlie DNA repair, charge separation
in donor-acceptor dyads, chromophore-to-solvent electron transfer, and singlet fission. This
framework for the accurate and efficient construction of excited state diabats and evaluation
of their couplings directly from DFT thus offers a route to simulate and elucidate photoinduced
electron and hole transfer in large disordered systems, such as those encountered in the condensed
phase.

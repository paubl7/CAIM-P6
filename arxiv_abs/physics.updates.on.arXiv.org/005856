When two miscible fluids are brought into contact with each other, the concentration gradients
induce stresses. These are referred to as Korteweg stresses and are analogous to interfacial tension
between two immiscible fluids, thereby acting as an effective interfacial tension (EIT) in inhomogeneous
miscible systems. EIT governs the formation of a viscous thread in flow-focusing of two miscible
fluids. To further investigate its significance, we have studied thread formation of a colloidal
dispersion focused by its own solvent. Experiments are combined with three-dimensional numerical
models to systematically expand previous knowledge utilising different flow-focusing channel
setups. In the reference setup, the sheath flows impinge the core flow orthogonally while in four
other channel setups, the sheath flows impinge the core flow at an oblique angle that is both positive
and negative with respect to the reference sheath direction. As an initial estimate of the EIT, we
fit the experimentally determined thread shape in the reference setup to a master curve that depends
on EIT through an effective capillary number. By numerically reproducing these experimental results,
it is concluded that the estimated EIT is within 25% of the optimal EIT value that can be deduced by
iteratively fitting the numerical results to the experimental measurements. Regardless of channel
setups, further numerical calculations performed using the optimal EIT evaluated from the reference
setup show good agreement with the experimental findings in terms of thread shapes, wetted region
morphologies, and velocity flow fields. The one-to-one comparison of numerical and experimental
findings unveil the crucial role of EIT on the thread detachment from the top and bottom walls of the
channel, bringing useful insights to understand the physical phenomenons involved in miscible
systems with a high-viscosity contrast.

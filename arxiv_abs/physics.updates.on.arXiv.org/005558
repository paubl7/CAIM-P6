The concept of evaluation gaps captures potential discrepancies between what researchers value
about their research, in particular research quality, and what metrics measure. The existence
of evaluation gaps can give rise to questions about the relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic
motivations to perform research, i.e. how field-specific notions of quality compete with notions
captured via evaluation metrics, and consequently how researchers manage the balancing act between
intrinsic values and requirements of evaluation procedures. This study analyses the evaluation
gap from a rational choice point of view for the case of observational astronomers, based on a literature
review and 19 semi-structured interviews with international astronomers. By taking a close look
at the role of institutional norms and different forms of capital - such as funding, publication
rates and granted telescope time - at play in astronomy, light can be shed on the workings of the balance
act and its consequences on research quality in astronomy. We find that astronomers experience
an anomie; they want to follow their intrinsic motivation to pursue science in order to push knowledge
forward, while at the same time following their extrinsic motivation to comply with institutional
norms. The balance act is the art of serving performance indicators in order to stay in academia,
while at the same time compromising research quality as little as possible. Gaming strategies shall
give the appearance of compliance, while institutionalised means how to achieve a good bibliometric
record are used in innovative ways, such as salami slicing or going for easy publications. This leads
to an overall decrease in research quality.

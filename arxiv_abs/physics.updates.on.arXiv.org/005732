Transported probability density function (PDF) methods are widely used to model turbulent flames
characterized by strong turbulence-chemistry interactions. Numerical methods directly resolving
the PDF are commonly used, such as the Lagrangian particle or the stochastic fields (SF) approach.
However, especially for premixed combustion configurations, characterized by high reaction
rates and thin reaction zones, a fine PDF resolution is required, both in physical and in composition
space, leading to high numerical costs. An alternative approach to solve a PDF is the method of moments,
which has shown to be numerically efficient in a wide range of applications. In this work, two Quadrature-based
Moment closures are evaluated in the context of turbulent premixed combustion. The Quadrature-based
Moment Methods (QMOM) and the recently developed Extended QMOM (EQMOM) are used in combination
with a tabulated chemistry approach to approximate the composition PDF. Both closures are first
applied to an established benchmark case for PDF methods, a plug-flow reactor with imperfect mixing,
and compared to reference results obtained from Lagrangian particle and SF approaches. Second,
a set of turbulent premixed methane-air flames are simulated, varying the Karlovitz number and
the turbulent length scale. The turbulent flame speeds obtained are compared with SF reference
solutions. Further, spatial resolution requirements for simulating these premixed flames using
QMOM are investigated and compared with the requirements of SF. The results demonstrate that both
QMOM and EQMOM approaches are well suited to reproduce the turbulent flame properties. Additionally,
it is shown that moment methods require lower spatial resolution compared to SF method.

In this work, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with different transport layers were fabricated to
understand the hysteresis phenomenon under a series of scan rates. The experimental results show
that the hysteresis phenomenon would be affected by the dielectric constant of transport layers
and scan rate significantly. To explain this, a modified Poisson and drift-diffusion solver coupled
with a fully time-dependent ion migration model is developed to analyze how the ion migration affects
the performance and hysteresis of PSCs. The simulation model was optimized for carrier transportation
of organic materials, which can simulate the organic transport layer correctly without using heavy
doping in simulating the organic transport layer. The modeling results show that the most crucial
factor in the hysteresis behavior is the built-in electric field of the perovskite. The non-linear
hysteresis curves are demonstrated under different scan rates, and the mechanism of the hysteresis
behavior is explained. The findings reveal why the change in hysteresis degree with scan rate is
Gaussian shaped rather than monotonic. Additionally, other factors contributing to the degree
of hysteresis are determined to be the degree of degradation in the perovskite material, the quality
of the perovskite crystal, and the materials of the transport layer, which corresponds to the total
ion density, carrier lifetime of perovskite, and the dielectric constant of the transport layer,
respectively. Finally, it was found that the dielectric constant of the transport layer is a key
factor affecting hysteresis in perovskite solar cells; a lower dielectric constant corresponds
to a higher electric field of the transport layer. Hence, if the electric field of the perovskite
material is small, the degree of hysteresis is small and vice versa.

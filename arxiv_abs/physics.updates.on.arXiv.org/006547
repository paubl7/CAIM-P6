Few-layer selenium and tellurium films have been recently prepared, and they provide a new platform
to explore novel properties of two-dimensional (2D) elemental materials. In this work, we have
performed a systematic first-principles study on the electronic, linear, and nonlinear optical
(NLO) properties of atomically thin selenium and tellurium films within the density-functional
theory with the generalized gradient approximation plus scissors correction using the band gaps
from the relativistic hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional calculations. Interestingly,
we find that few-layer Se and Te possess large second-harmonic generation (SHG), linear electro-optic
effect, and bulk photovoltaic effect. In particular, trilayer (TL) Te possesses large SHG coefficient,
being more than 65 times larger than that of GaN, a widely used NLO material. Bilayer (BL) Te has huge
static SHG coefficient, being more than 100 times larger than that of GaN. Furthermore, monolayer
(ML) Se possesses large SHG coefficient. Moreover, we predict that TL Te exhibits strong bulk photovoltaic
effect (BPVE), being greater than that of GeS, a polar system with the largest BPVE found so far. Although
the shift current conductivities of bulk and 2D Se are comparable, the shift current conductivities
of TL Te are five times larger than those of bulk Te. Finally, an analysis of the calculated electronic
band structures indicates that the strong NLO responses of 2D Se and Te materials are primarily derived
from their low-dimensional structures with high anisotropy, directional covalent bonding, lone-pair
electrons, and relatively small band gaps. These findings provide a practical strategy to search
for excellent NLO and BPVE materials.

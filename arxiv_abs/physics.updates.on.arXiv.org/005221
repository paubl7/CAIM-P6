While micro-CT systems are instrumental in preclinical research, clinical micro-CT imaging has
long been desired with cochlear implantation as a primary example. The structural details of the
cochlear implant and the temporal bone require a significantly higher image resolution than that
(about 0.2 mm) provided by current medical CT scanners. In this paper, we propose a clinical micro-CT
(CMCT) system design integrating conventional spiral cone-beam CT, contemporary interior tomography,
deep learning techniques, and technologies of micro-focus X-ray source, photon-counting detector
(PCD), and robotic arms for ultrahigh resolution localized tomography of a freely-selected volume
of interest (VOI) at a minimized radiation dose level. The whole system consists of a standard CT
scanner for a clinical CT exam and VOI specification, and a robotic-arm based micro-CT scanner for
a local scan at much higher spatial and spectral resolution as well as much reduced radiation dose.
The prior information from global scan is also fully utilized for background compensation to improve
interior tomography from local data for accurate and stable VOI reconstruction. Our results and
analysis show that the proposed hybrid reconstruction algorithm delivers superior local reconstruction,
being insensitive to the misalignment of the isocenter position and initial view angle in the data/image
registration while the attenuation error caused by scale mismatch can be effectively addressed
with bias correction. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of our system design. We envision
that deep learning techniques can be leveraged for optimized imaging performance. With high resolution
imaging, high dose efficiency and low system cost synergistically, our proposed CMCT system has
great potentials in temporal bone imaging as well as various other clinical applications.

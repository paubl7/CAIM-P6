The \kovats retention index is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the rate at which a compound
is processed through a gas chromatography column. This quantity is independent of many experimental
variables and, as such, is considered a near-universal descriptor of retention time on a chromatography
column. The \kovats retention indices of a large number of molecules have been determined experimentally.
The "NIST 20: GC Method\slash Retention Index Library" database has collected and, more importantly,
curated retention indices of a subset of these compounds resulting in a highly valued reference
database. The experimental data in the library form an ideal data set for training machine learning
models for the prediction of retention indices of unknown compounds. In this article, we describe
the training of a graph neural network model to predict the \kovats retention index for compounds
in the NIST library and compare this approach with previous work \cite{2019Matyushin}. We predict
the \kovats retention index with a mean unsigned error of 28 index units as compared to 44, the putative
best result using a convolutional neural network \cite{2019Matyushin}. The NIST library also
incorporates an estimation scheme based on a group contribution approach that achieves a mean unsigned
error of 114 compared to the experimental data. Our method uses the same input data source as the group
contribution approach, making its application straightforward and convenient to apply to existing
libraries. Our results convincingly demonstrate the predictive powers of systematic, data-driven
approaches leveraging deep learning methodologies applied to chemical data and for the data in
the NIST 20 library outperform previous models.

Since the original algorithm by John Vidale in 1988 to numerically solve the isotropic eikonal equation,
there has been tremendous progress on the topic addressing an array of challenges including improvement
of the solution accuracy, incorporation of surface topography, adding more accurate physics by
accounting for anisotropy/attenuation in the medium, and speeding up computations using multiple
CPUs and GPUs. Despite these advances, there is no mechanism in these algorithms to carry on information
gained by solving one problem to the next. Moreover, these approaches may breakdown for certain
complex forms of the eikonal equation, requiring approximation methods to estimate the solution.
Therefore, we seek an alternate approach to address the challenge in a holistic manner, i.e., a method
that not only makes it simpler to incorporate topography, allow accounting for any level of complexity
in physics, benefiting from computational speedup due to the availability of multiple CPUs or GPUs,
but also able to transfer knowledge gained from solving one problem to the next. We develop an algorithm
based on the emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural network to solve various forms of the
eikonal equation. We show how transfer learning and surrogate modeling can be used to speed up computations
by utilizing information gained from prior solutions. We also propose a two-stage optimization
scheme to expedite the training process in presence of sharper heterogeneity in the velocity model.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how the proposed approach makes it simpler to incorporate additional
physics and other features in contrast to conventional methods that took years and often decades
to make these advances. Such an approach not only makes the implementation of eikonal solvers much
simpler but also puts us on a much faster path to progress.

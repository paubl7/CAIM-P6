Explicit structure-preserving geometric Particle-in-Cell (PIC) algorithm in curvilinear orthogonal
coordinate systems is developed. The work reported represents a further development of the structure-preserving
geometric PIC algorithm [1-12], achieving the goal of practical applications in magnetic fusion
research. The algorithm is constructed by discretizing the field theory for the system of charged
particles and electromagnetic field using Whitney forms, discrete exterior calculus, and explicit
non-canonical symplectic integration. In addition to the truncated infinitely dimensional symplectic
structure, the algorithm preserves exactly many important physical symmetries and conservation
laws, such as local energy conservation, gauge symmetry and the corresponding local charge conservation.
As a result, the algorithm possesses the long-term accuracy and fidelity required for first-principles-based
simulations of the multiscale tokamak physics. The algorithm has been implemented in the SymPIC
code, which is designed for high-efficiency massively-parallel PIC simulations in modern clusters.
The code has been applied to carry out whole-device 6D kinetic simulation studies of tokamak physics.
A self-consistent kinetic steady state for fusion plasma in the tokamak geometry is numerically
found with a predominately diagonal and anisotropic pressure tensor. The state also admits a steady-state
sub-sonic ion flow in the range of 10 km/s, agreeing with experimental observations [13, 14] and
analytical calculations [15, 16]. Kinetic ballooning instability in the self-consistent kinetic
steady state is simulated. It shows that high-n ballooning modes have larger growth rates than low-n
global modes, and in the nonlinear phase the modes saturate approximately in 5 ion transit times

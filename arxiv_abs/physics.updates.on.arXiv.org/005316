Explicit structure-preserving geometric Particle-in-Cell (PIC) algorithm in particular curvilinear
orthogonal coordinate systems is developed. The work reported represents a crucial further development
of the structure-preserving geometric PIC algorithm [1-12], achieving the goal of practical applications
in magnetic fusion research. The algorithm was constructed by discretizing the field theory for
the system of charged particles and electromagnetic field using Whitney forms, discrete exterior
calculus, and explicit non-canonical symplectic integration. In addition to the truncated infinitely
dimensional symplectic structure, the algorithm preserves exactly many important physical symmetries
and conservation laws, such as energy conservation, gauge symmetry and the corresponding charge
conservation. As a result, the algorithm possesses the long-term accuracy and fidelity required
for first-principle based large-scale simulations of the multiscale tokamak physics. The algorithm
has been implemented in the SymPIC code, designed for high-efficiency massively-parallel PIC
simulations in modern clusters. The code has been applied to carry out a first whole-device 6D kinetic
simulation study of tokamak physics. A self-consistent kinetic equilibrium for fusion plasma
in the tokamak geometry is numerically found with a predominately diagonal and anisotropic pressure
tensor. The kinetic equilibrium also admits a steady-state sub-sonic ion flow in the range of 10
km/s, agreeing with previous experimental observations and analytical calculations. Kinetic
ballooning instability in the self-consistent kinetic equilibrium is simulated. It shows that
high-n ballooning mode has a larger growth rate than low-n global modes. In the nonlinear phase,
the modes saturate approximately in 5 ion transit time at the 2\% level by the E\texttimes B flow generated
by the instability.

The received wisdom on how activity affects energy expenditure is that the more activity is undertaken,
the more calories will have been burned by the end of the day. Yet traditional hunter-gatherers,
who lead physically hard lives, burn no more calories each day than western populations living in
labour-saving environments. Indeed, there is now a wealth of data, both for humans and other animals,
demonstrating that long-term lifestyle changes involving increases in exercise or other physical
activities do not result in commensurate increases in daily energy expenditure (DEE). This is because
humans and other animals exhibit a degree of energy compensation at the organismal level, ameliorating
some of the increases in DEE that would occur from the increased activity by decreasing the energy
expended on other biological processes. And energy compensation can be sizable, reaching many
hundreds of calories in humans. But the processes that are downregulated in the long-term to achieve
energy compensation are far from clear, particularly in humans. We do not know how energy compensation
is achieved. My review here of the literature on relevant exercise intervention studies, for both
humans and other species, indicates conflict regarding the role that basal metabolic rate (BMR)
or low level activity such as fidgeting play, if any, particularly once changes in body composition
are factored out. In situations where BMR and low-level activity are not major components of energy
compensation, what then drives it? I discuss how changes in mitochondrial efficiency and changes
in circadian fluctuations in BMR may contribute to our understanding of energy management. Currently
unexplored, these mechanisms and others may provide important insights into the mystery of how
energy compensation is achieved.

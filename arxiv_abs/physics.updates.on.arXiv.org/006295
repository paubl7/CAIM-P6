Assumption-free mass quantification of nanofilms, nanoparticles, and (supra)molecular adsorbates
in liquid environment remains a key challenge in many branches of science. Mechanical resonators
can uniquely determine the mass of essentially any adsorbate; yet, when operating in liquid environment,
the liquid dynamically coupled to the adsorbate contributes significantly to the measured response,
which complicates data interpretation and impairs quantitative adsorbate mass determination.
Employing the Navier-Stokes equation for liquid velocity in contact with an oscillating surface,
we show that the liquid contribution can be eliminated by measuring the response in solutions with
identical kinematic viscosity but different densities. Guided by this insight, we used quartz
crystal microbalance (QCM), one of the most widely-employed mechanical resonator, to demonstrate
that kinematic-viscosity matching can be utilized to accurately quantify the dry mass of systems
such as adsorbed rigid nanoparticles, tethered biological nanoparticles (lipid vesicles), as
well as highly hydrated polymeric films. The same approach applied to the simultaneously measured
energy dissipation made it possible to quantify the mechanical properties of the adsorbate and
its attachment to the surface, as demonstrated by, for example, probing the hydrodynamic stablization
induced by nanoparticles crowding. Finally, we envision that the possibility to simultaneously
determine the dry mass and mechanical properties of adsorbates as well as the liquid contributions
will provide the experimental tools to use mechanical resonators for applications beyond mass
determination, as for example to directly interrogate the orientation, spatial distribution,
and binding strength of adsorbates without the need for complementary techniques.

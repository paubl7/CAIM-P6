Deep learning has been broadly applied to imaging in scattering applications. A common framework
is to train a "descattering" neural network for image recovery by removing scattering artifacts.
To achieve the best results on a broad spectrum of scattering conditions, individual "expert" networks
have to be trained for each condition. However, the performance of the expert sharply degrades when
the scattering level at the testing time differs from the training. An alternative approach is to
train a "generalist" network using data from a variety of scattering conditions. However, the generalist
generally suffers from worse performance as compared to the expert trained for each scattering
condition. Here, we develop a drastically different approach, termed dynamic synthesis network
(DSN), that can dynamically adjust the model weights and adapt to different scattering conditions.
The adaptability is achieved by a novel architecture that enables dynamically synthesizing a network
by blending multiple experts using a gating network. Notably, our DSN adaptively removes scattering
artifacts across a continuum of scattering conditions regardless of whether the condition has
been used for the training, and consistently outperforms the generalist. By training the DSN entirely
on a multiple-scattering simulator, we experimentally demonstrate the network's adaptability
and robustness for 3D descattering in holographic 3D particle imaging. We expect the same concept
can be adapted to many other imaging applications, such as denoising, and imaging through scattering
media. Broadly, our dynamic synthesis framework opens up a new paradigm for designing highly adaptive
deep learning and computational imaging techniques.

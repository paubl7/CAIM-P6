Quantum-mechanical methods are widely used for understanding molecular interactions throughout
biology, chemistry, and materials science. Quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and coupled cluster
with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] are two state-of-the-art
and trusted wavefunction methods that have been categorically shown to yield accurate interaction
energies for small organic molecules. These methods provide valuable reference information for
widely-used semi-empirical and machine learning potentials, especially where experimental
information is scarce. However, agreement for systems beyond small molecules is a crucial remaining
milestone for cementing the benchmark accuracy of these methods. Approaching such well-converged
predictive power in larger molecules has motivated major developments in CCSD(T) as well as DMC
algorithms in the past years, resulting in orders of magnitude time-to-solution reductions. Here,
we show that CCSD(T) and DMC interaction energies are not in consistent agreement for a set of polarizable
supramolecules. Whilst agreement is found for some of the complexes, in a few key systems disagreements
of up to 8 kcal/mol remained. This leads to differences of up to 6 orders of magnitude in the corresponding
binding association constant at room temperature for systems which are well within the accustomed
domain of applicability for both methods. These findings thus indicate that more caution is required
when aiming at reproducible non-covalent interactions between extended molecules. Our data contradicts
the expectation that the most comprehensive and robust wavefunction methods predict identical
non-covalent interactions and indicate an unsolved challenge for benchmark approaches.

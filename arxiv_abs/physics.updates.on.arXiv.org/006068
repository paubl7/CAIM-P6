In conventional Kerr- and Faraday microscopy the sample is illuminated with plane-polarised light
and a magnetic domain contrast is generated by an analyser making use of the Kerr- or Faraday rotation.
In this paper we demonstrate possibilities of analyser-free magneto-optical microscopy based
on magnetisation-dependent intensity modulations of the light: (i) The transverse Kerr effect
can be applied for in-plane magnetised material, demonstrated for an FeSi sheet. (ii) Illuminating
the same sample with circularly polarised light leads to a domain contrast with a different symmetry
as the conventional Kerr contrast. (iii) Circular polarisation can also be used for perpendicularly
magnetised material, demonstrated for a garnet film and an ultrathin CoFeB film. (iv) Plane-polarised
light at a specific angle can be employed for both, in-plane and perpendicular media. (v) Perpendicular
light incidence leads to a domain contrast on in-plane materials that is quadratic in the magnetisation
and to a domain boundary contrast. (vi) Domain contrast can even be obtained without polariser.
In cases (ii) and (iii), the contrasts are generated by MCD (Magnetic Circular Dichroism), i.e.
by the differential absorption of left and right circularly polarised light, induced by magnetization
components along the direction of light propagation. In case (v) the contrast is caused by MLD (Magnetic
Linear Dichroism), i.e. by the differential absorption of linearly polarised light, induced by
magnetisation components transverse to the propagation direction. The domain boundary contrast
is due to the magneto-optical gradient effect. An explanation of these contrast phenomena is provided
in terms of Maxwell-Fresnel theory.

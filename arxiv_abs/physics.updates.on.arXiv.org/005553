Elastic anisotropy might be a combined effect of the intrinsic anisotropy and the anisotropy induced
by thin-layering. The Backus average, a useful mathematical tool, allows us to describe such an
effect quantitatively. The results are meaningful only if the underlying physical assumptions
are obeyed, such as static equilibrium of the material. We focus on the only mathematical assumption
of the Backus average, namely, product approximation. It states that the average of the product
of a varying function with nearly-constant function is approximately equal to the product of the
averages of those functions. We discuss particular, problematic case for which the aforementioned
assumption is inaccurate. Further, we focus on the seismological context. We examine numerically
if the inaccuracy affects the wave propagation in a homogenous medium -- obtained using the Backus
average -- equivalent to thin layers. We take into consideration various material symmetries,
including orthotropic, cubic, and others. We show that the problematic case of product approximation
is strictly related to the negative Poisson's ratio of constituent layers. Therefore, we discuss
the laboratory and well-log cases in which such a ratio has been noticed. Upon thorough literature
review, it occurs that examples of so-called auxetic materials (media that have negative Poisson's
ratio) are not extremely rare exceptions as thought previously. The investigation and derivation
of Poisson's ratio for materials exhibiting symmetry classes up to monoclinic become a significant
part of this paper. Except for the main objectives, we also show that the averaging of cubic layers
results in an equivalent medium with tetragonal (not cubic) symmetry. Additionally, we present
concise formulations of stability conditions for low symmetry classes, such as trigonal, orthotropic,
and monoclinic.

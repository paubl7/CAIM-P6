Heart rate variability (HRV), defined as the variability between consecutive heartbeats, is a
surrogate measure of cardiac vagal tone. It is widely accepted that a decreased HRV is associated
to several risk factors and cardiovascular diseases. However, a possible association between
HRV and altered cerebral hemodynamics is still debated, suffering from HRV short-term measures
and the paucity of high-resolution deep cerebral data. We propose a computational approach to evaluate
the deep cerebral and central hemodynamics subject to physiological alterations of HRV in an ideal
young healthy patient at rest. The cardiovascular-cerebral model was validated and recently exploited
to understand the hemodynamic mechanisms between cardiac arrythmia and cognitive deficit. Three
configurations (baseline, increased HRV, and decreased HRV) are built based on the standard deviation
(SDNN) of RR beats. In the cerebral circulation, our results show that HRV has overall a stronger
impact on pressure than flow rate mean values but similarly alters pressure and flow rate in terms
of extreme events. By comparing reduced and increased HRV, this latter induces a higher probability
of altered mean and extreme values, and is therefore more detrimental at distal cerebral level.
On the contrary, at central level a decreased HRV induces a higher cardiac effort without improving
the mechano-contractile performance, thus overall reducing the heart efficiency. Present results
suggest that: (i) the increase of HRV per se does not seem to be sufficient to trigger a better cerebral
hemodynamic response; (ii) by accounting for both central and cerebral circulations, the optimal
HRV configuration is found at baseline. Given the relation inversely linking HRV and HR, the presence
of this optimal condition can contribute to explain why the mean HR of the general population settles
around the baseline value (70 bpm).

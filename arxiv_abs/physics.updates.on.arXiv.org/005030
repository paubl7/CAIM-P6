Miniature fluorescence microscopes are a standard tool in systems biology. However, widefield
miniature microscopes capture only 2D information, and modifications that enable 3D capabilities
increase the size and weight and have poor resolution outside a narrow depth range. Here, we achieve
the 3D capability by replacing the tube lens of a conventional 2D Miniscope with an optimized multifocal
phase mask at the objective's aperture stop. Placing the phase mask at the aperture stop significantly
reduces the size of the device, and varying the focal lengths enables a uniform resolution across
a wide depth range. The phase mask encodes the 3D fluorescence intensity into a single 2D measurement,
and the 3D volume is recovered by solving a sparsity-constrained inverse problem. We provide methods
for designing and fabricating the phase mask and an efficient forward model that accounts for the
field-varying aberrations in miniature objectives. We demonstrate a prototype that is 17 mm tall
and weighs 2.5 grams, achieving 2.76 $\mu$m lateral, and 15 $\mu$m axial resolution across most
of the 900x700x390 $\mu m^3$ volume at 40 volumes per second. The performance is validated experimentally
on resolution targets, dynamic biological samples, and mouse brain tissue. Compared with existing
miniature single-shot volume-capture implementations, our system is smaller and lighter and
achieves a more than 2x better lateral and axial resolution throughout a 10x larger usable depth
range. Our microscope design provides single-shot 3D imaging for applications where a compact
platform matters, such as volumetric neural imaging in freely moving animals and 3D motion studies
of dynamic samples in incubators and lab-on-a-chip devices.

Macroscopic fibers of carbon nanotubes (CNT) have emerged as an ideal architecture to exploit the
exceptional properties of CNT building blocks in applications ranging from energy storage to reinforcement
in structural composites. Controlled synthesis and scalability are amongst the most pressing
challenges to further materialize the potential of CNT fibers. This workshows that under floating
catalyst chemical vapor conditions in the direct spinning method, used both in research and industry,the
ceramic reactor tube plays an unsuspected active role in CNT growth, leading for example to doubling
of reaction yield when mullite (Al4+2xSi2-2xO10-x(x = 0.4)) is used instead of alumina (Al2O3),
but without affecting CNT morphology in terms of number of layers, purity or degree of graphitization.
This behaviour has been confirmed for different carbon sources andwhen growing either predominantly
single-walled or multi-walled CNTs by adjusting promotor concentration. Analysis of large Si-based
impurities occasionally found in CNT fiber fabric samples, attributed to reactor tube fragments
that end up trapped inthe porous fibers, indicate that the role of the reactor tube is in catalyzing
the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons, which subsequently react with floating Fe catalyst
nanoparticles and produce extrusion of the CNTs and formation of an aerogel. Reactor gas analysis
confirms that extensive thermal decomposition of the carbon source occurs in the absence of Fe catalystparticles,
and that the concentration of different carbon species (e.g. carbon dioxide and ethylene) is sensitive
to the reactor tube type. These finding open new avenues for controlled synthesis of CNT fibers by
decoupling precursor decomposition from CNT extrusion at the catalyst particle.

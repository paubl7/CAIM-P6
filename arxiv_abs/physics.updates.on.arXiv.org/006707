This paper contributes to the development and evaluation of a deep learning workflow that accurately
and efficiently predicts the temporal-spatial evolution of pressure and CO2 plumes during injection
and post-injection periods of geologic CO2 sequestration (GCS) operations. Based on a Fourier
Neuron Operator, the deep learning workflow takes input variables or features including rock properties,
well operational controls and time steps, and predicts the state variables of pressure and CO2 saturation.
To further improve the predictive fidelity, separate deep learning models are trained for CO2 injection
and post-injection periods due the difference in primary driving force of fluid flow and transport
during these two phases. We also explore different combinations of features to predict the state
variables. We use a realistic example of CO2 injection and storage in a 3D heterogeneous saline aquifer,
and apply the deep learning workflow that is trained from physics-based simulation data and emulate
the physics process. Through this numerical experiment, we demonstrate that using two separate
deep learning models to distinguish post-injection from injection period generates the most accurate
prediction of pressure, and a single deep learning model of the whole GCS process including the cumulative
injection volume of CO2 as a deep learning feature, leads to the most accurate prediction of CO2 saturation.
For the post-injection period, it is key to use cumulative CO2 injection volume to inform the deep
learning models about the total carbon storage when predicting either pressure or saturation.
The deep learning workflow not only provides high predictive fidelity across temporal and spatial
scales, but also offers a speedup of 250 times compared to full physics reservoir simulation, and
thus will be a significant predictive tool for engineers to manage the long term process of GCS.

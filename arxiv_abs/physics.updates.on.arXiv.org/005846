Purpose: The impact of microscopic diffusional kurtosis ($\mu K$) - arising from restricted diffusion
and/or structural disorder - remains a controversial issue in contemporary diffusion MRI (dMRI).
Recently, Correlation Tensor MRI (CTI) was introduced to disentangle the sources contributing
to diffusional kurtosis, without relying on a-priori assumptions. Here, we aimed to investigate
$\mu K$ in in vivo rat brains and assess its impact on state-of-the-art methods ignoring $\mu K$.
Methods: CTI harnesses double diffusion encoding (DDE) experiments, which were here improved
for speed and minimal bias using four different sets of acquisition parameters. The robustness
of CTI estimates from the improved protocol is assessed in simulations. The in vivo CTI acquisitions
were performed in healthy rat brains using a 9.4T pre-clinical scanner equipped with a cryogenic
coil, and targeted the estimation of $\mu K$, anisotropic kurtosis, and isotropic kurtosis. Results:
The improved CTI acquisition scheme substantially reduces scan time and importantly, also minimizes
higher-order-term biases, thus enabling robust $\mu K$ estimation, alongside Kaniso and Kiso
metrics. Our CTI experiments revealed positive $\mu K$ both in white and grey matter of the rat brain
in vivo; $\mu K$ is the dominant kurtosis source in healthy grey matter tissue. The non-negligible
$\mu K$ substantially biases prior state-of-the-art analyses of Kiso and Kaniso. Conclusion:
Correlation Tensor MRI offers a more accurate and robust characterization of kurtosis sources
than its predecessors. $\mu K$ is non-negligible in vivo in healthy white and grey matter tissues
and could be an important biomarker for future studies. Our findings thus have both theoretical
and practical implications for future experiments.

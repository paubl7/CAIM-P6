It is known that the gravitational analogue of the Faraday rotation arises in the rotating spacetime
due to the non-zero gravitomagnetic field. In this paper, we show that it also arises in the `non-rotating'
Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, if it is immersed in a uniform magnetic field. The non-zero angular
momentum (due to the presence of electric charge and magnetic field) of the electromagnetic field
acts as the twist potential to raise the gravitational Faraday rotation as well as the gravitational
Stern-Gerlach effect in the said spacetimes. The twisting can still exist even if the mass of the
spacetime vanishes. In other words, the massless charged particle(s) immersed in a uniform magnetic
field, able to twist the spacetime in principle, and responsible for the rotation of the plane of
polarization of light. This, in fact, could have applications in the basic physics and the analogue
models of gravity. Here, we also study the effect of magnetic fields in the Kerr and Reissner-Nordstr\"om
spacetimes, and derive the exact expressions for the gravitational Faraday rotation and the gravitational
Stern-Gerlach effect in the magnetized Kerr and Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes. Considering
the correction due to the magnetic field in the lowest possible order, we show that the logarithm
correction of the distance of the source and observer in the gravitational Faraday rotation and
gravitational Stern-Gerlach effect for the said spacetimes is an important consequence of the
presence of magnetic field. From the astrophysical point of view, our result could be helpful to
study the effects of (gravito-)magnetic fields on the propagation of polarized photons in the strong
gravity regime of the rapidly rotating collapsed object.

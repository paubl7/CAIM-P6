Microfluidic devices offer unique opportunities to directly observe multiphase flow in porous
media. However, as a direct representation of flow in geological pore networks, conventional microfluidics
face several challenges. One is that simultaneous two-phase flow is not possible in a 2D network
without fluctuation occupancy of pores. Nonetheless, such flow is possible in a microfluidic network
if wetting phase can form a bridge across the gap between solid surfaces at a pore constriction while
non-wetting phase flows through the constriction. We call this phenomenon "bridging". Here we
consider the conditions under which this is possible as a function of capillary pressure and geometry
of the constriction. Using the Surface Evolver program, we determine conditions for stable interfaces
in a constriction, the range of capillary pressures at which bridging can occur, and those where
the wetting phase would invade and block the constriction to the flow of the non-wetting phase ("snap-off").
We assume that the channels have uniform depth, vertical walls, and flat bottom and top surfaces,
and that one phase perfectly wets the solid surfaces. If the constriction is long and straight, snap-off
occurs at the same capillary pressure as bridging. For long, curved channels, snap-off happens
as liquid imbibes before bridging can occur. For constrictions between cylindrical pillars, however,
there is a range of capillary pressures at which bridging is stable; the range is greater the narrower
the diameter of the cylinders relative to the width of the constriction. For smaller-diameter pillars,
snap-off as non-wetting phase invades a downstream pore body is not possible. We relate these results
to the shape of pore networks commonly used in microfluidic studies of two-phase flow to consider
whether two-phase flow is possible in these networks without fluctuating pore occupancy.

Plasma response to resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) near the pedestal top is crucial for
accessing edge localized modes (ELMs) suppression in tokamaks. Since radial location of relevant
rotation zero-crossing plays a key role in determining the threshold for field penetration of RMP,
plasma response may be different in low input torque plasma. In this work, the linear MHD code MARS-F
is applied to reveal the dependence of plasma response to RMP on rotation zero-crossing by a scan
of rotation profiles based on an EAST equilibrium. It is shown that the plasma response is enhanced
when zero-crossing occurs near rational surfaces. The dependence of plasma response on the location
of rotation zero-crossing is well fitted by a double Gaussian, indicating two effects in this enhancement.
One is induced by rotation screening effect shown as a wide base (with a width around $10-20~\mathrm{krad/s}$),
and the other is related to resistive singular layer effect characterized by a localized peak (with
a width around $3-4~\mathrm{krad/s}$). The peak of each resonant harmonic in plasma response appears
always at rotation zero-crossing. The width of the peak scales with the resistive singular layer
width. The plasma displacement suggests the response is tearing like when zero-crossing is within
the singular layer, while it is kink like when zero-crossing is far from the layer. The enhancement
of magnetic islands' width at the peak is only around a factor of two, when the absolute value of local
rotation is not larger than the characteristic width around $10-20~\mathrm{krad/s}$. This suggests
that the rotation near pedestal top should not be far away from zero but may not be necessary to have
zero-crossing for accessing ELM suppression.

The discovery of amino acids in meteorites has presented two clues to the origin of their processing
subsequent to their formation: a slight preference for left-handedness in some of them, and isotopic
anomalies in some of their constituent atoms. In this article we present theoretical results from
the Supernova Neutrino Amino Acid Processing (SNAAP) model, which uses electron anti-neutrinos
and the magnetic fields from source objects such as supernovae or colliding neutron stars to selectively
destroy one amino acid chirality and to create isotopic abundance shifts. For plausible magnetic
fields and electron anti-neutrino fluxes, non-zero, positive enantiomeric excesses, $ee$s,
defined to be the relative left/right asymmetry in an amino acid population, are reviewed for two
amino acids, and conditions are suggested that would produce $ee>0$ for all of the $\alpha$-amino
acids. The relatively high energy anti-neutrinos that produce the $ee$s would inevitably also
produce isotopic anomalies. A nuclear reaction network was developed to describe the reactions
resulting from them and the nuclides in the meteorites. At similar anti-neutrino fluxes, assumed
recombination of the detritus from the anti-neutrino interactions is shown to produce appreciable
isotopic anomalies in qualitative agreement with those observed for D/$^1$H and $^{15}$N/$^{14}$N.
The isotopic anomalies for $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C are predicted to be small, as are also observed. Autocatalysis
may be necessary for any model to produce the largest $ee$s observed in meteorites. This allows the
constraints of the original SNAAP model to be relaxed, increasing the probability of meteoroid
survival in sites where amino acid processing is possible. These results have obvious implications
for the origin of life on Earth.

Space and water heating accounts for about 40% of final energy consumption in the European Union
(EU) and thus plays a key role in reducing overall costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Many
scenarios to reach net-zero emissions in buildings rely on electrification via heat pumps as well
as resistive heating, but meeting the peaks of demand in the winter can be challenging, particularly
when wind and solar resources are low. This paper examines how to mitigate space heating demand peaks
most cost-effectively in a top-down model. It comprises the European electricity, heat and transport
sectors with net carbon dioxide emissions constrained to be zero. While other papers have individually
optimized either the supply options to meet heating peaks or the energy efficiency of buildings
with fixed energy prices, this paper introduces the first model that co-optimizes both supply and
efficiency simultaneously including the residential and service sectors, with country-level
resolution and hourly modelling over several years. This approach enables the model to capture
the competition between technologies to address these heating peaks, namely retrofitting the
thermal envelope of buildings, thermal energy storage and individual hybrid heat pumps with backup
gas boilers. A novel thought experiment is used to show that it is the need to reduce the strong seasonal
peak in heating demand that determines the level of building renovations, rather than the need to
reduce overall energy consumption. If all three instruments are applied, overall costs are reduced
by up to 17%. Building renovation enables the largest benefit with cost savings of up to 14%. Individual
gas boilers and the associated distribution network can be removed from the energy system without
significant higher system costs, as long as there is retrofitting of the thermal envelope.

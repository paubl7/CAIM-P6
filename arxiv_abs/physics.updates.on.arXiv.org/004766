Turbulence in the flow of fluid through a pipe can be suppressed by buoyancy forces. As the suppression
of turbulence leads to severe heat transfer deterioration, this is an important and undesirable
phenomenon in both heating and cooling applications. Our direct numerical simulations (DNS) show
that under certain heating conditions, measured by the buoyancy parameter $C$, shear turbulence
may either be completely laminarised or transitions to a relatively quiescent convection-driven
state. A linear instability is found at $C \approx 4$, roughly independent of the Reynolds number
$Re$. Buoyancy forces cause a flattening of the mean streamwise velocity profile, an effect which
in isothermal pipe flow has recently been linked to complete suppression of turbulence (Kuehnen
et al., Nat. Phys., vol. 14, 2018, pp. 386-390) and enhanced nonlinear stability (Marensi et al.,
J. Fluid Mech., vol. 863, 2019, pp. 50-875). In agreement with these findings, the lower-branch
travelling-wave solution analysed here, which is believed to mediate transition to turbulence
in isothermal pipe flow, is shown to be suppressed by buoyancy. Furthermore, the laminarisation
criterion proposed by He et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 809, 2016, pp. 31-71), based on an apparent Reynolds
number of the flow as measured by its driving pressure gradient, is found to capture the critical
$C=C_{cr}(Re)$ above which the flow will be laminarised or switch to the convection-driven type.
Bistability between shear and convection-driven states is thus observed in the region $4 \lesssim
C \lesssim C_{cr}$ where the flow may or may not be laminarised depending on the initial flow of the
experiment. Our analysis suggests that it is the weakened rolls, rather than the streaks, which
appear to be critical for laminarisation.

Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma process that is thought to play a key role in the production
of nonthermal particles associated with explosive phenomena in space physics and astrophysics.
Experiments at high-energy-density facilities are starting to probe the microphysics of reconnection
at high Lundquist numbers and large system sizes. We have performed particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations
to explore particle acceleration for parameters relevant to laser-driven reconnection experiments.
We study particle acceleration in large system sizes that may be produced soon with the most energetic
laser drivers available, such as at the National Ignition Facility. In these conditions, we show
the possibility of reaching the multi-plasmoid regime, where plasmoid acceleration becomes dominant.
Our results show the transition from \textit{X} point to plasmoid-dominated acceleration associated
with the merging and contraction of plasmoids that further extend the maximum energy of the power-law
tail of the particle distribution for electrons. We also find for the first time a system-size-dependent
emergence of nonthermal ion acceleration in driven reconnection, where the magnetization of ions
at sufficiently large sizes allows them to be contained by the magnetic field and energized by direct
\textit{X} point acceleration. For feasible experimental conditions, electrons and ions can
attain energies of $\epsilon_{max,e} / k_{B} T_{e} > 100$ and $\epsilon_{max,i} / k_{B} T_{i} >
1000$. Using PIC simulations with binary Monte Carlo Coulomb collisions we study the impact of collisionality
on plasmoid formation and particle acceleration. The implications of these results for understanding
the role reconnection plays in accelerating particles in space physics and astrophysics are discussed.

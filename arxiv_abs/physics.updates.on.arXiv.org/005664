The earliest atmospheres of rocky planets originate from extensive volatile release during magma
ocean epochs that occur during assembly of the planet. These establish the initial distribution
of the major volatile elements between different chemical reservoirs that subsequently evolve
via geological cycles. Current theoretical techniques are limited in exploring the anticipated
range of compositional and thermal scenarios of early planetary evolution, even though these are
of prime importance to aid astronomical inferences on the environmental context and geological
history of extrasolar planets. Here, we present a coupled numerical framework that links an evolutionary,
vertically-resolved model of the planetary silicate mantle with a radiative-convective model
of the atmosphere. Using this method we investigate the early evolution of idealized Earth-sized
rocky planets with end-member, clear-sky atmospheres dominated by either H$_2$, H$_2$O, CO$_2$,
CH$_4$, CO, O$_2$, or N$_2$. We find central metrics of early planetary evolution, such as energy
gradient, sequence of mantle solidification, surface pressure, or vertical stratification of
the atmosphere, to be intimately controlled by the dominant volatile and outgassing history of
the planet. Thermal sequences fall into three general classes with increasing cooling timescale:
CO, N$_2$, and O$_2$ with minimal effect, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CH$_4$ with intermediate influence,
and H$_2$ with several orders of magnitude increase in solidification time and atmosphere vertical
stratification. Our numerical experiments exemplify the capabilities of the presented modeling
framework and link the interior and atmospheric evolution of rocky exoplanets with multi-wavelength
astronomical observations.

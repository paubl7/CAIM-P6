Context. Observations of exoplanets indicate the existence of several correlations in the architecture
of planetary systems. Exoplanets within a system tend to be of similar size and mass, evenly spaced
and often ordered in size and mass. Small planets are frequently packed in tight configurations,
while large planets often have wider orbital spacing. Together, these correlations are called
the peas in a pod trends in the architecture of planetary systems. Aims. In this paper, these trends
are investigated in theoretically simulated planetary systems and compared with observations.
Whether these correlations emerge from astrophysical processes or the detection biases of the
transit method is examined. Methods. Using the Generation III Bern Model, synthetic planetary
systems are simulated. KOBE, a new computer code, simulates the geometrical limitations of the
transit method and applies the detection biases and completeness of the Kepler survey. This allows
simulated planetary systems to be confronted with observations. Results. The architecture of
synthetic planetary systems, observed via KOBE, show the peas in a pod trends in good agreement with
observations. These correlations are also present in the theoretical underlying population,
from the Bern Model, indicating that these trends are probably of astrophysical origin. Conclusions.
Physical processes, involved in planet formation, are responsible for the emergence of evenly
spaced planets with similar sizes and masses. The size/mass similarity trends are primordial and
originate from the oligarchic growth of protoplanetary embryos and the uniform growth of planets
at early times. Later stages in planet formation allows planets, within a system, to grow at different
rates thereby decreasing these correlations. The spacing and packing correlations are absent
at early times and arise from dynamical interactions.

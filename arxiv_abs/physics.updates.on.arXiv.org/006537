MOLLER is a future experiment designed to measure parity violation in Moller scattering to extremely
high precision. MOLLER will measure the right-left scattering differential cross-section parity-violating
asymmetry APV , in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons off an unpolarized LH2 target to
extreme ppb precision. To make this measurement, the polarized electron source, generated with
a circularly polarized laser beam, must have the ability to switch quickly between right and left
helicity polarization states. The polarized source must also maintain minimal right-left helicity
correlated beam asymmetries, including energy changes, position changes, intensity changes,
or spot-size changes. These requirements can be met with appropriate choice and design of the Pockels
cell used to generate the circularly polarized light. Rubidium Titanyl Phosphate (RTP) has been
used in recent years for ultra-fast Pockels cell switches due to its lack of piezo-electric resonances
at frequencies up to several hundred MHz. However, crystal non-uniformity in this material leads
to poorer extinction ratios than in commonly used KD*P Pockels cells when used in hald-wave configuration.
It leads to voltage dependent beam steering when used in quarter-wave configuration. Here we present
an innovative RTP Pockels cell design which uses electric field gradients to counteract crystal
non-uniformities and control beam steering down to the nm-level. We demonstrate this RTP Pockels
cell design is capable of producing precisely controlled polarized electron beam at Jefferson
Laboratory, a national accelerator facility, for current experiments, including the recent PREX
II measurement, as well as the future MOLLER experiment.

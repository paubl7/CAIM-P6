Electron temperature anisotropies and electron beams are nonthermal features of the observed
nonequilibrium electron velocity distributions in the solar wind. In collision-poor plasmas
these nonequilibrium distributions are expected to be regulated by kinetic instabilities through
wave-particle interactions. This study considers electron instabilities driven by the interplay
of core electron temperature anisotropies and the electron beam, and firstly gives a comprehensive
analysis of instabilities in arbitrary directions to the background magnetic field. It clarifies
the dominant parameter regime (e.g., parallel core electron plasma beta $\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$,
core electron temperature anisotropy $A_{\mathrm{ec}}\equiv T_{\mathrm{ec\perp}}/T_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$,
and electron beam velocity $V_{\mathrm{eb}}$) for each kind of electron instability (e.g., the
electron beam-driven electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic instability, the electron beam-driven
whistler instability, the electromagnetic electron cyclotron instability, the electron mirror
instability, the electron firehose instability, and the ordinary-mode instability). It finds
that the electron beam can destabilize electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic waves in the low-$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$
regime, and whistler waves in the medium- and large-$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$ regime.
It also finds that a new oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler instability is driven by the electron
beam with $V_{\mathrm{eb}}\gtrsim7V_{\mathrm{A}}$ in a regime where $\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}\sim0.1-2$
and $A_{\mathrm{ec}}<1$. Moreover, this study presents electromagnetic responses of each kind
of electron instability. These results provide a comprehensive overview for electron instability
constraints on core electron temperature anisotropies and electron beams in the solar wind.

Magnetic reconnection (MR) plays a fundamental role in plasma dynamics under many different conditions,
from space and astrophysical environments to laboratory devices. High-resolution in-situ measurements
from space missions allow to study naturally occurring MR processes in great detail. Alongside
direct measurements, numerical simulations play a key role in investigating the fundamental physics
underlying MR. The choice of an adequate plasma model to be employed in numerical simulations, while
also compromising with their computational cost, is crucial to efficiently address the problem.
We consider a new plasma model that includes a refined electron response within the hybrid-kinetic
framework (kinetic ions, fluid electrons). The extent to which this new model can reproduce a full-kinetic
description of 2D MR, with particular focus on its robustness during the non-linear stage, is evaluated.
We perform 2D simulations of MR with moderate guide field by means of three different plasma models:
a hybrid-Vlasov-Maxwell model with isotropic, isothermal electrons, a hybrid-Vlasov-Landau-fluid
(HVLF) model where an anisotropic electron fluid is equipped with a Landau-fluid closure, and a
full-kinetic one. When compared to the full-kinetic case, the HVLF model effectively reproduces
the main features of MR, as well as several aspects of the associated electron micro-physics and
its feedback onto proton dynamics. This includes the global evolution of MR and the local physics
occurring within the so-called electron-diffusion region, as well as the evolution of species
pressure anisotropy. In particular, anisotropy driven instabilities (such as firehose, mirror,
and cyclotron instabilities) play a relevant role in regulating electrons anisotropy during the
non-linear stage of MR. As expected, the HVLF model captures all these features, except for the electron-cyclotron
instability.

In collisionless and turbulent space plasmas, e.g., of the solar wind or the magnetosheath of the
Earth's magnetosphere, dissipation of macroscopic energy into heat occurs in and around current
sheets self-consistently formed in the turbulence. Instabilities in these current sheets driven
by free energy sources provided by spatial gradients or non-Maxwellean features of the velocity
distribution function can provide collisionless dissipation and influence the properties of
the turbulence. In order to determine the free energy sources provided by the spatial gradients
of plasma number density and electron/ion bulk velocities in current sheets formed in collisionless
turbulent plasmas with an applied external magnetic field, we carried out two-dimensional PIC-hybrid-code
simulations. We found that current sheets in a collisionless turbulent plasma are formed primarily
by electron shear flows with electron bulk velocity much larger than the ion bulk velocity while
the density variations through the current sheets are relatively small ($<$ 10\%). The electron
bulk velocities and, thus, the current densities inside the sheets are directed mainly parallel
to the external magnetic field. The shear in the perpendicular electron and ion bulk velocities
generates electron- and ion-flow vorticities in the direction parallel to the external magnetic
field. Inside the current sheets the parallel electron-flow vorticity exceeds the parallel ion-flow
vorticity, it changes its sign around the current sheet centers and peaks near the edges of current
sheets. An ion temperature anisotropy develops near current sheets during their formation. It
correlates well with the parallel ion vorticity as well as with the parallel electron vorticity.
Theoretical estimates in the limit of un-magnetized ions support the simulation results.

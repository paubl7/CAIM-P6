The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the education system worldwide that was responding
with a sudden shift to distance learning. Various physics courses such as lectures, tutorials,
and the laboratories had to be transferred into online formats rapidly, resulting in a variety of
simultaneous, asynchronous, and mixed activities. To investigate how physics students perceived
the sudden shift to online learning, we developed a questionnaire and gathered data from N = 578 physics
students from five universities in Germany, Austria, and Croatia. In this article, we report how
the problem-solving sessions (recitations) and laboratories were adapted, how students' judge
different formats of the courses and how useful and effective they perceive them. The results are
correlated to the students' self-efficacy ratings and other behavioral measures (such as self-regulated
learning skills) and demographics. In a related article, we focus on the online physics lectures
and compare simultaneous vs. asynchronous teaching and learning methods (n.n.). We find that good
communication abilities and self-organization skills are positively correlated for perceived
learning achievement. Furthermore, the previous duration of studies had a significant impact
on the students' perceived overall learning achievement, on the students' acquisition of experimental
skills during the physics laboratories, and on their assessment of the recitations' effectiveness.
That is, students in their first academic year show consistently lower scores than more progressed
students. For the physics laboratories, it was found that gathering real data was crucial to the
acquisition of experimental skills and the reinforcement of content. For the physics recitations,
handing in own solutions for feedback was correlated with perceived effectiveness. We draw conclusions
and implications for future online classes.

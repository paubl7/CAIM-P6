We present a new numerical scheme for one-dimensional conduction problems of a spherical shell.
The scheme adopts a solution of the conduction equation in each interval of the chosen discretization
that is valid if the fluxes at interval boundaries are constant in time. This piece-wise steady flux
(PWSF) numerical scheme is continuous and differentiable in the space domain, which is convenient
for implementing the numerical scheme in an energy-conserved thermal evolution model of a planetary
core in which a conductive stratified layer develops below the core-mantle boundary when the heat
flux is subadiabatic. The influence of a time-variable stratified region on the general evolution
of the planetary body is examined, in comparison to imposing an adiabatic temperature profile for
the core. By considering stratification in a planetary core where the heat flux is subadiabatic,
radial variations in the cooling rate are accounted for whereas otherwise the distribution of energy
in the core is fixed by the imposed adiabat. During the growth of the thermally stratified region,
the deep part of the core cools more rapidly than the outer part of the core. Therefore, the inner core
grows to a larger size and the temperature and heat flux at the core-mantle boundary are higher and
larger, respectively, if a stratified region is considered. For the Earth, the implications are
likely very minor and can be neglected in thermal evolution studies that are not specifically interested
in the stratified region itself. For Mercury, these implications are much larger. For example,
the age of the inner core can be underestimated by several billion years if thermal stratification
is neglected. Consideration of thermal stratification in the core of Mercury also increases the
mantle temperature, leads to a larger heat flux into the lithosphere, and prolongs mantle convection.

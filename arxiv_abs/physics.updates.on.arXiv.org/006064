Non-invasive subsurface imaging using full waveform inversion (FWI) has the potential to fundamentally
change engineering site characterization by enabling the recovery of high resolution 2D/3D maps
of subsurface stiffness. Yet, the accuracy of FWI remains quite sensitive to the choice of the initial
starting model due to the complexity and non-uniqueness of the inverse problem. In response, we
present the novel application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to transform an experimental
seismic wavefield acquired using a linear array of surface sensors directly into a robust starting
model for 2D FWI. We begin by describing three key steps used for developing the CNN, which include:
selection of a network architecture, development of a suitable training set, and performance of
network training. The ability of the trained CNN to predict a suitable starting model for 2D FWI was
compared against other commonly used starting models for a classic near-surface imaging problem;
the identification of an undulating, two-layer, soil-bedrock interface. The CNN developed during
this study was able to predict complex 2D subsurface images of the testing set directly from their
seismic wavefields with an average mean absolute percent error of 6%. When compared to other common
approaches, the CNN approach was able to produce starting models with smaller seismic image and
waveform misfits, both before and after FWI. The ability of the CNN to generalize to subsurface models
which were dissimilar to the ones upon which it was trained was assessed using a more complex, three-layered
model. While the predictive ability of the CNN was slightly reduced, it was still able to achieve
seismic image and waveform misfits comparable to the other commonly used starting models. This
study demonstrates that CNNs have great potential as a tool for developing good starting models
for FWI ...

We propose to take advantage of the weak coupling of ground-state helium-3 nuclear spin to its environment
to produce long-lived macroscopic quantum states, nuclear spin squeezed states, in a gas cell at
room temperature. To perform a quantum non-demolition measurement of a transverse component of
the polarized collective nuclear spin, we maintain a population in helium-3 metastable state with
a discharge. The collective spin associated to $F=1/2$ metastable level hybridizes with the ground
state one by metastability exchange collisions. To access nuclear spin fluctuations, one continuously
measures the light leaking out of an optical cavity, where it has interacted dispersively with the
metastable state collective spin. In a three coupled collective spin model (nuclear, metastable
and Stokes), we calculate moments of the nuclear spin squeezed component $I_z$ conditioned on the
time averaged optical signal. In the photon counting scheme, the squeezed observable is $I_z^2$
rather than $I_z$. In the homodyne detection scheme, we solve the stochastic equation for the system
state conditioned on the measurement; the conditional expectation value of $I_z$ depends linearly
on the signal and the conditional variance of $I_z$ does not depend on it. The conditional variance
decreases as $(\Gamma_{\rm sq}t)^{-1}$, where the squeezing rate $\Gamma_{\rm sq}$ depends linearly
on the light intensity in the cavity at weak atom-field coupling and saturates at strong coupling
to the ground state metastability exchange effective rate, proportional to the metastable atom
density. Including de-excitation of metastable atoms at the walls, which induces nuclear spin
decoherence with an effective rate $\gamma_\alpha$, we find a limit $\propto(\gamma_\alpha/\Gamma_{\rm
sq})^{1/2}$ on the conditional variance reached in a time $\propto(\gamma_\alpha\Gamma_{\rm
sq})^{-1/2}$.

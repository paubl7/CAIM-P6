Diffusion studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were conducted on two model
surfactant solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide/sodium salicylate (CTAB/NaSal) and
cetylpyridinium chloride/sodium salicylate (CPCl/NaSal). By increasing the salt-to-surfactant
concentration ratio, these systems display two peaks in the zero-shear viscosity and relaxation
time, which are indicative of transitions from linear to branched micellar networks. The goal of
this work is to assess the sensitivity of NMR diffusometry to different types of micellar microstructures
and identify the mechanism(s) of surfactant self-diffusion in micellar solutions. At low salt-to-surfactant
concentration ratios, for which wormlike micelles are linear, the surfactant self-diffusion
is best described by a mean squared displacement, Z2, that varies as Z2 ~ Tdiff 0.5, where Tdiff is
the diffusion time. As the salt concentration increases to establish branched micelles, Z2 ~ Tdiff,
indicating a Brownian-like self-diffusion of surfactant molecules in branched micelles. This
result indicates that NMR diffusometry is capable of differentiating various types of micellar
microstructure. In addition, the self-diffusion coefficient of the surfactant molecules in linear
and branched micelles are determined, for the first time, by comparing to the existing restricted
diffusion models, and shown to be much slower than the diffusion of proton molecules in the bulk.
Moreover, in linear and moderately branched wormlike micelles, the dominant mechanism of surfactant
self-diffusion is through the curvilinear diffusion of the surfactant molecules along the contour
length of the micelles, whereas in the branched micelles, before the second viscosity maxima, the
surfactant self-diffusion could arise from a combination of micellar breakage, exchange between
micelles and/or the bulk.

The ability to cultivate the cyanobacterium Arhtrospira platensis in artificially lightened
photobioreactors using high energetic efficiency (quasi-monochromatic) red LED was investigated.
In order to reach the same maximal productivities as with the polychromatic lightening control
conditions (red + blue, P/2e- = 1.275), the need to work with an optimal range of wavelength around
620 nm was first established on batch and continuous cultures. The long-term physiological and
kinetic behavior was then verified in a continuous photobioreactor illuminated only with red (620
nm) LED, showing that the maximum productivities can be maintained over 30 residence times with
only minor changes in the pigment content of the cells corresponding to a well-known adaptation
mechanism of the photosystems, but without any effect on growth and stoichiometry. For both poly
and monochromatic incident light inputs, a predictive spectral knowledge model was proposed and
validated for the first time, allowing the calculation of the kinetics and stoichiometry observed
in any photobioreactor cultivating A. platensis, or other cyanobacteria if the parameters were
updated. It is shown that the photon flux (with a specified wavelength) must be used instead of light
energy flux as a relevant control variable for the growth. The experimental and theoretical results
obtained in this study demonstrate that it is possible to save the energy consumed by the lightening
device of photobioreactors using red LED, the spectral range of which is defined according to the
action spectrum of photosynthesis. This appears to be crucial information for applications in
which the energy must be rationalized, as it is the case for life support systems in closed environments
like a permanent spatial base or a submarine.

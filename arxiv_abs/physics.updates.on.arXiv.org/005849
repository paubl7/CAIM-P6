The risk of long range, herein `airborne', infection needs to be better understood and is especially
urgent during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We present a method to determine the relative risk
of airborne transmission that can be readily deployed with either modelled or monitored CO$_2$
data and occupancy levels within an indoor space. For spaces regularly, or consistently, occupied
by the same group of people, e.g. an open-plan office or a school classroom, we establish protocols
to assess the absolute risk of airborne infection of this regular attendance at work or school. We
present a methodology to easily calculate the expected number of secondary infections arising
from a regular attendee becoming infectious and remaining pre/asymptomatic within these spaces.
We demonstrate our model by calculating risks for both a modelled open-plan office and by using monitored
data recorded within a small naturally ventilated office. In addition, by inferring ventilation
rates from monitored CO$_2$ we show that estimates of airborne infection can be accurately reconstructed;
thereby offering scope for more informed retrospective modelling should outbreaks occur in spaces
where CO$_2$ is monitored. Our modelling suggests that regular attendance at an office for work
is unlikely to significantly contribute to the pandemic but only if relatively quiet desk-based
work is carried out in the presence of adequate ventilation (i.e. at least 10\,l/s/p following UK
guidance), appropriate hygiene controls, distancing measures, and that all commuting presents
minimal infection risk. Crucially, modelling even moderate changes to the conditions within the
office, or basing estimates for the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 variant B1.1.7 current data,
typically results in the prediction that for a single infector within the office the airborne route
alone gives rises to more than one secondary infection.

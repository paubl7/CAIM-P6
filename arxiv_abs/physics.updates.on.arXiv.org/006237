Potential energy stored during the inter-seismic period by tectonic loading around faults is released
during earthquakes as radiated energy, heat and fracture energy. The latter is of first importance
since it controls the nucleation, propagation and arrest of the seismic rupture. On one side, fracture
energy estimated for natural earthquakes (breakdown work) shows a clear slip-dependence. On the
other side, recent experimental studies highlighted that, fracture energy is a material property
limited by an upper bound value corresponding to the fracture energy of the intact material independently
of the size of the event. To reconcile these contradictory observations, we performed stick-slip
experiments in a bi-axial shear configuration. We analyzed the fault weakening during frictional
rupture by accessing to the near-fault stress-slip curve through strain gauge array. We first estimated
fracture energy by comparing the measured strain with the theoretical predictions from Linear
Elastic Fracture Mechanics and a Cohesive Zone Model. By comparing these values to the breakdown
work obtained from the integration of the stress-slip curve, we show that, at the scale of our experiments,
fault weakening is divided into two stages; the first one consistent with the estimated fracture
energy, and a long-tailed weakening corresponding to a larger energy not localized at the rupture
tip, increasing with slip. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that only the first weakening
stage controls the rupture initiation and that the breakdown work induced by the long-tailed weakening
can enhance slip during rupture propagation and allow the rupture to overcome stress heterogeneity
along the fault. We conclude that the origin of the seismological estimates of breakdown work could
be related to the energy dissipated in the long-tailed weakening rather than to the one dissipated
near the tip.

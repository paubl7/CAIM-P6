Energetic electrons inside Earth's outer Van Allen belt pose a major radiation threat to space-borne
electronics that often play vital roles in our modern society. Ultra-relativistic electrons with
energies greater than or equal to two Megaelectron-volt (MeV) are of particular interest due to
their high penetrating ability, and thus forecasting these >=2 MeV electron levels has significant
meaning to all space sectors. Here we update the latest development of the predictive model for MeV
electrons inside the Earth's outer radiation belt. The new version, called PreMevE-2E, focuses
on forecasting ultra-relativistic electron flux distributions across the outer radiation belt,
with no need of in-situ measurements except for at the geosynchronous (GEO) orbit. Model inputs
include precipitating electrons observed in low-Earth-orbits by NOAA satellites, upstream solar
wind conditions (speeds and densities) from solar wind monitors, as well as ultra-relativistic
electrons measured by one Los Alamos GEO satellite. We evaluated a total of 32 supervised machine
learning models that fall into four different classes of linear and neural network architectures,
and also successfully tested ensemble forecasting by using groups of top-performing models. All
models are individually trained, validated, and tested by in-situ electron data from NASA's Van
Allen Probes mission. It is shown that the final ensemble model generally outperforms individual
models overs L-shells, and this PreMevE-2E model provides reliable and high-fidelity 25-hr (~1-day)
and 50-hr (~2-day) forecasts with high mean performance efficiency values. Our results also suggest
this new model is dominated by non-linear components at low L-shells (< ~4) for ultra-relativistic
electrons, which is different from the dominance of linear components at all L-shells for 1 MeV electrons
as previously discovered.

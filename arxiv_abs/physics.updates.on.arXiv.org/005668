The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative to classical
Navier-Stokes solvers. This is particularly true for hemodynamics in complex geometries. However,
in its most basic formulation, {i.e.} with the so-called single relaxation time (SRT) collision
operator, it has been observed to have a limited stability domain in the Courant/Fourier space,
strongly constraining the minimum time-step and grid size. The development of improved collision
models such as the multiple relaxation time (MRT) operator in central moments space has tremendously
widened the stability domain, while allowing to overcome a number of other well-documented artifacts,
therefore opening the door for simulations over a wider range of grid and time-step sizes. The present
work focuses on implementing and validating a specific collision operator, the central Hermite
moments multiple relaxation time model with the full expansion of the equilibrium distribution
function, to simulate blood flows in intracranial aneurysms. The study further proceeds with a
validation of the numerical model through different test-cases and against experimental measurements
obtained via stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) and phase-contrast magnetic resonance
imaging (PC-MRI). For a patient-specific aneurysm both PIV and PC-MRI agree fairly well with the
simulation. Finally, low-resolution simulations were shown to be able to capture blood flow information
with sufficient accuracy, as demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative analysis
of the flow field {while leading to strongly reduced computation times. For instance in the case
of the patient-specific configuration, increasing the grid-size by a factor of two led to a reduction
of computation time by a factor of 14 with very good similarity indices still ranging from 0.83 to
0.88.}

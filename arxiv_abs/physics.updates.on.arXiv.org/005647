In the field of nuclear reactor physics, transient phenomena are usually studied using deterministic
or hybrids methods. These methods require many approximations, such as: geometry, time and energy
discretizations, material homogenization and assumption of diffusion conditions, among others.
In this context, Monte Carlo simulations are specially adequate to study these problems. Challenges
presented when using Monte Carlo simulations in space-time kinetics in fissile systems are the
different time-scales involved in prompt and delayed neutron emission, which implies that results
obtained have a large variance associated if an analog Monte Carlo simulation is utilized. Furthermore,
in both deterministic and Monte Carlo simulations delayed neutron precursors are grouped in a $6$-
or $8$- group structure, but nowadays there is not a solid reason to keep this aggregation. In this
work, and for the first time, individual precursor data is implemented in a Monte Carlo simulation,
explicitly including the time dependence related to the $\beta$-delayed neutron emission. This
was accomplished by modifying the open source Monte Carlo code OpenMC. In the modified code -- Time
Dependent OpenMC or OpenMC(TD) -- time dependency related to delayed neutron emission originated
from $\beta$-decay was addressed. Continuous energy neutron cross-sections data used comes from
JEFF-$3$.$1$.$1$ library. Individual precursor data was taken from JEFF-$3$.$1$.$1$ (cumulative
yields) and ENDF-B/VIII.$0$ (delayed neutron emission probabilities and delayed neutron energy
spectra). OpenMC(TD) was tested in: i) a monoenergetic system; ii) an energy dependent unmoderated
system where the precursors were taken individually or in a group structure; and finally iii) a light-water
moderated energy dependent system, using $6$-groups, $50$ and $40$ individual precursors.

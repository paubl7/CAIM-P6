An Omnimagnet is an electromagnetic device that enables remote magnetic manipulation of devices
such as medical implants and microrobots. It is comprised of three orthogonal nested solenoids
with a ferromagnetic core at the center. Electrical current within the solenoids leads to Joule
heating, resulting in undesired temperature increase within the Omnimagnet. If the temperature
exceeds the melting point of the wire insulation, device failure will occur. Thus, a study of heat
transfer within an Omnimagnet is a necessity, particularly to maximize the performance of the device.
For the first time, a transient heat transfer model, that incorporates all three heat transfer modes,
is proposed and validated with experimental data for an Omnimagnet with maximum root mean square
error equal to 8${\%}$ (4$^{\circ}$C). This transient model is not computationally expensive.
It is relatively easy to apply to Omnimagnets with different structures. The accuracy of this model
depends on the accuracy of the input data. The code is applied to calculate the maximum safe operational
time at a fixed input current or the maximum safe input current for a fixed time interval. The maximum
safe operational time and maximum safe input current depend on size and structure of the Omnimagnet
and the lowest melting point of all the Omnimagnet materials. A parametric study shows that increasing
convective heat transfer during cooling, and during heating with low input currents, is an effective
method to increase the maximum operational time of the Omnimagnet.The thermal model is also presented
in a state-space equation format that can be used in a real-time Kalman filter current controller
to avoid device failure due to excessive heating.

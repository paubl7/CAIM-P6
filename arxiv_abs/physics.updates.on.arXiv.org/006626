The power-balanced hybrid optical imaging system is a special design of a diffractive computational
camera, introduced in this paper, with image formation by a refractive lens and Multilevel Phase
Mask (MPM). This system provides a long focal depth with low chromatic aberrations thanks to MPM
and a high energy light concentration due to the refractive lens. We introduce the concept of optical
power balance between the lens and MPM which controls the contribution of each element to modulate
the incoming light. Additional unique features of our MPM design are the inclusion of quantization
of the MPM's shape on the number of levels and the Fresnel order (thickness) using a smoothing function.
To optimize optical power-balance as well as the MPM, we build a fully-differentiable image formation
model for joint optimization of optical and imaging parameters for the proposed camera using Neural
Network techniques. Additionally, we optimize a single Wiener-like optical transfer function
(OTF) invariant to depth to reconstruct a sharp image. We numerically and experimentally compare
the designed system with its counterparts, lensless and just-lens optical systems, for the visible
wavelength interval (400-700)nm and the depth-of-field range (0.5-$\infty$m for numerical and
0.5-2m for experimental). The attained results demonstrate that the proposed system equipped
with the optimal OTF overcomes its counterparts (even when they are used with optimized OTF) in terms
of reconstruction quality for off-focus distances. The simulation results also reveal that optimizing
the optical power-balance, Fresnel order, and the number of levels parameters are essential for
system performance attaining an improvement of up to 5dB of PSNR using the optimized OTF compared
with its counterpart lensless setup.

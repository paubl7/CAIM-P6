Single photon sources (SPS), especially those based on solid state quantum emitters, are key elements
in future quantum technologies. What is required is the development of broadband, high quantum
efficiency, room temperature SPS which can also be tunably coupled to optical cavities which could
lead to development of all-optical quantum communication platforms. In this regard deterministic
coupling of SPS to plasmonic nanocavity arrays has great advantage due to long propagation length
and delocalized nature of surface lattice resonances (SLRs). Guided by these considerations,
we report experiments on the room temperature tunable coupling of single photon emitting colloidal
quantum dots (CQDs) to localised and delocalised modes in plasmonic nanocavity arrays. Using time-resolved
photo-luminescence measurement on isolated CQD, we report significant advantage of SLRs in realizing
much higher Purcell effect, despite large dephasing of CQDs, with values of ~22 and ~ 6 for coupling
to the lattice and localised modes, respectively. We present measurements on the antibunching
of CQDs coupled to these modes with g(2)(0) values in quantum domain providing evidence for an effective
cooperative behavior. We present a density matrix treatment of the coupling of CQDs to plasmonic
and lattice modes enabling us to model the experimental results on Purcell factors as well as on the
antibunching. We also provide experimental evidence of indirect excitation of remote CQDs mediated
by the lattice modes and propose a model to explain these observations. Our study demonstrates the
possibility of developing nanophotonic platforms for single photon operations and communications
with broadband quantum emitters and plasmonic nanocavity arrays since these arrays can generate
entanglement between to spatially separated quantum emitters.

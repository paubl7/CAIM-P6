For single source helical Computed Tomography (CT), both Filtered-Back Projection (FBP) and statistical
iterative reconstruction have been investigated. However for dual source CT with flying focal
spot (DS-FFS CT), statistical iterative reconstruction that accurately models the scanner geometry
and physics remains unknown to researchers. Therefore, this paper presents a novel physics-based
iterative reconstruction method for DS-FFS CT and assess its image quality. Our algorithm uses
precise physics models to reconstruct from the native cone-beam geometry and interleaved dual
source helical trajectory of a DS-FFS CT. To do so, we construct a noise physics model to represent
data acquisition noise and a prior image model to represent image noise and texture. In addition,
we design forward system models to compute the locations of deflected focal spots, the dimension
and sensitivity of voxels and detector units, as well as the length of intersection between X-rays
and voxels. The forward system models further represent the coordinated movement between the dual
sources by computing their X-ray coverage gaps and overlaps at an arbitrary helical pitch. With
the above models, we reconstruct images by using an advanced Consensus Equilibrium (CE) numerical
method to compute the maximum a posteriori estimate to a joint optimization problem that simultaneously
fits all models. We compared our reconstruction with Siemens ADMIRE, which is the clinical standard
hybrid iterative reconstruction (IR) method for DS-FFS CT, in terms of spatial resolution, noise
profile and image artifacts through both phantoms and clinical datasets. Experiments show that
our reconstruction has a consistently higher spatial resolution than the clinical standard hybrid
IR. In addition, our reconstruction shows a reduced magnitude of image undersampling artifacts
than the clinical standard.

Matched filter (MF) techniques have been widely used for retrieval of greenhouse gas enhancements
(enh.) from imaging spectroscopy datasets. While multiple algorithmic techniques and refinements
have been proposed, the greenhouse gas target spectrum used for concentration enh. estimation
has remained largely unaltered since the introduction of quantitative MF retrievals. The magnitude
of retrieved methane and carbon dioxide enh., and thereby integrated mass enh. (IME) and estimated
flux of point-source emitters, is heavily dependent on this target spectrum. Current standard
use of molecular absorption coefficients to create unit enh. target spectra does not account for
absorption by background concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar and sensor geometry, or atmospheric
water vapor absorption. We introduce geometric and atmospheric parameters into the generation
of scene-specific (SS) unit enh. spectra to provide target spectra that are compatible with all
greenhouse gas retrieval MF techniques. For methane plumes, IME resulting from use of standard,
generic enh. spectra varied from -22 to +28.7% compared to SS enh. spectra. Due to differences in
spectral shape between the generic and SS enh. spectra, differences in methane plume IME were linked
to surface spectral characteristics in addition to geometric and atmospheric parameters. IME
differences for carbon dioxide plumes, with generic enh. spectra producing integrated mass enh.
-76.1 to -48.1% compared to SS enh. spectra. Fluxes calculated from these integrated enh. would
vary by the same %s, assuming equivalent wind conditions. Methane and carbon dioxide IME were most
sensitive to changes in solar zenith angle and ground elevation. SS target spectra can improve confidence
in greenhouse gas retrievals and flux estimates across collections of scenes with diverse geometric
and atmospheric conditions.

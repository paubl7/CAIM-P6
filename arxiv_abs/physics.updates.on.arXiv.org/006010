The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is a nonlinear shear-driven instability that develops
at the interface between shear flows in plasmas. KHI has been inferred in various astrophysical
plasmas and has been observed in situ at the magnetospheric boundaries of solar-system planets
and through remote sensing at the boundaries of coronal mass ejections. While it was hypothesized
to play an important role in the mixing of plasmas and in triggering solar wind fluctuations, its
direct and unambiguous observation in the solar wind was still lacking. We report in-situ observations
of ongoing KHI in the solar wind using Solar Orbiter during its cruise phase. The KHI is found in a shear
layer in the slow solar wind in the close vicinity of the Heliospheric Current Sheet, with properties
satisfying linear theory for its development. An analysis is performed to derive the local configuration
of the KHI. A 2-D MHD simulation is also set up with empirical values to test the stability of the shear
layer. In addition, magnetic spectra of the KHI event are analyzed. We find that the observed conditions
satisfy the KHI onset criterion from the linear theory analysis, and its development is further
confirmed by the simulation. The current sheet geometry analyses are found to be consistent with
KHI development. Additionally, we report observations of an ion jet consistent with magnetic reconnection
at a compressed current sheet within the KHI interval. The KHI is found to excite magnetic and velocity
fluctuations with power-law scalings that approximately follow $k^{-5/3}$ and $k^{-2.8}$ in
the inertial and dissipation ranges, respectively. These observations provide robust evidence
of KHI development in the solar wind. This sheds new light on the process of shear-driven turbulence
as mediated by the KHI with implications for the driving of solar wind fluctuations.

The work is a continuation of a paper by Iskhakov A.S. and Dinh N.T. "Physics-integrated machine
learning: embedding a neural network in the Navier-Stokes equations". Part I // arXiv:2008.10509
(2020) [1]. The proposed in [1] physics-integrated (or PDE-integrated (partial differential
equation)) machine learning (ML) framework is furtherly investigated. The Navier-Stokes equations
are solved using the Tensorflow ML library for Python programming language via the Chorin's projection
method. The Tensorflow solution is integrated with a deep feedforward neural network (DFNN). Such
integration allows one to train a DFNN embedded in the Navier-Stokes equations without having the
target (labeled training) data for the direct outputs from the DFNN; instead, the DFNN is trained
on the field variables (quantities of interest), which are solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations
(velocity and pressure fields). To demonstrate performance of the framework, two additional case
studies are formulated: 2D turbulent lid-driven cavities with predicted by a DFNN (a) turbulent
viscosity and (b) derivatives of the Reynolds stresses. Despite its complexity and computational
cost, the proposed physics-integrated ML shows a potential to develop a "PDE-integrated" closure
relations for turbulent models and offers principal advantages, namely: (i) the target outputs
(labeled training data) for a DFNN might be unknown and can be recovered using the knowledge base
(PDEs); (ii) it is not necessary to extract and preprocess information (training targets) from
big data, instead it can be extracted by PDEs; (iii) there is no need to employ a physics- or scale-separation
assumptions to build a closure model for PDEs. The advantage (i) is demonstrated in the Part I paper
[1], while the advantage (ii) is the subject of the current paper.

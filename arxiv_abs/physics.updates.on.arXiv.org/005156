Reprocessing of regional-scale airborne electromagnetic data (AEM) is used to build a 3D geomodel
of the Nasia sub-basin. The resulting 3D geomodel integrates all the prior pieces of information
brought by electromagnetic data, lithologic logs, and prior geological knowledge. The AEM data,
consisting of GEOTEM B-field data, were originally collected for mineral exploration. Thus, those
B-field data had to be (re)processed and properly inverted as the original survey and data handling
were designed for the detection of potential mineral targets and not for detailed geological mapping.
These new inversions provided a different picture of the subsurface. The new geophysical model
led to new interpretations of the geological settings and to the construction of a comprehensive
3D geomodel of the basin. The evidence of a system of paleovalleys could be inferred from the AEM data.
The stratigraphy of these paleovalleys suggests a different glaciation history from the known
Marinoan events, commonly associated with the Kodjari formation of the Voltaian sedimentary basin.
The presence of the paleovalleys within the Panabako may be correlated with mountain glaciation
within the Sturtian age, though no unequivocal glaciogenic strata have yet been identified. Pre-Marinoan
glaciation is recorded in rocks of the Wassangara group of the Taoudeni Basin. The combination of
the Marinoan and, possibly, Sturtian glaciation episodes, both of the Cryogenian period, can be
an indication of a Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth. The occurrence of those features not only has
important socioeconomic consequences - as the paleovalleys can act as reservoirs for groundwater
- but also from a scientific point of view, they could require a revision of the present stratigraphy
of the area.

Eukaryotic cells are mechanically supported by a polymer network called the cytoskeleton, which
consumes chemical energy to dynamically remodel its structure. Recent experiments in vivo have
revealed that this remodeling occasionally happens through anomalously large displacements,
reminiscent of earthquakes or avalanches. These cytoskeletal avalanches might indicate that
the cytoskeleton's structural response to a changing cellular environment is highly sensitive,
and they are therefore of significant biological interest. However, the physics underlying "cytoquakes"
is poorly understood. Here, we use agent-based simulations of cytoskeletal self-organization
to study fluctuations in the network's mechanical energy. We robustly observe non-Gaussian statistics
and asymmetrically large rates of energy release compared to accumulation in a minimal cytoskeletal
model. The large events of energy release are found to correlate with large, collective displacements
of the cytoskeletal filaments. We also find that the changes in the localization of tension and the
projections of the network motion onto the vibrational normal modes are asymmetrically distributed
for energy release and accumulation. These results imply an avalanche-like process of slow energy
storage punctuated by fast, large events of energy release involving a collective network rearrangement.
We further show that mechanical instability precedes cytoquake occurrence through a machine learning
model that dynamically forecasts cytoquakes using the vibrational spectrum as input. Our results
provide the first connection between the cytoquake phenomenon and the network's mechanical energy
and can help guide future investigations of the cytoskeleton's structural susceptibility.

Ocean hazardous spills and search and rescue incidents are more prevalent as maritime activities
increase across all sectors of society. However, emergency response time remains a factor due to
a lack of information to accurately forecast the location of small objects. Existing drifting characterization
techniques are limited to objects whose drifting properties are not affected by on-board wind and
surface current sensors. To address this challenge, we study the application of multirotor unmanned
aerial systems (UAS), and embedded navigation technology, for on-demand wind velocity and surface
flow measurements to characterize drifting properties of small objects. An off-the-shelf quadrotor
was used to measure wind velocity at 10 m above surface level near a drifting object. We also leveraged
UAS-grade attitude and heading reference systems and GPS antennas to build water-proof tracking
modules that record the position and orientation, as well of translational and rotational velocities,
of objects drifting in water. The quadrotor and water-proof tracking modules were deployed during
field experiments conducted in lake and ocean environments to characterize the leeway parameters
of manikins simulating a person in water. Leeway parameters were found to be an order of magnitude
within previous estimates derived using conventional wind and surface current observations.
We also determined that multirotor UAS and water-proof tracking modules can provide accurate and
high-resolution ambient information that is critical to understand how changes in orientation
affect the downwind displacement and jibing characteristics of small objects floating in water.
These findings support further development and application of multirotor UAS technology for leeway
characterization and understanding the effect of an object's downwind-relative orientation
on its drifting characteristics.

Characterizing metastable neural dynamics in finite-size spiking networks remains a daunting
challenge. We propose to address this challenge in the recently introduced replica-mean-field
(RMF) limit. In this limit, networks are made of infinitely many replicas of the finite network of
interest, but with randomized interactions across replica. Such randomization renders certain
excitatory networks fully tractable at the cost of neglecting activity correlations, but with
explicit dependence on the finite size of the neural constituents. However, metastable dynamics
typically unfold in networks with mixed inhibition and excitation. Here, we extend the RMF computational
framework to point-process-based neural network models with exponential stochastic intensities,
allowing for mixed excitation and inhibition. Within this setting, we show that metastable finite-size
networks admit multistable RMF limits, which are fully characterized by stationary firing rates.
Technically, these stationary rates are determined as solutions to a set of delayed differential
equations under certain regularity conditions that any physical solutions shall satisfy. We solve
this original problem by combining the resolvent formalism and singular-perturbation theory.
Importantly, we find that these rates specify probabilistic pseudo-equilibria which accurately
capture the neural variability observed in the original finite-size network. We also discuss the
emergence of metastability as a stochastic bifurcation, which can also be interpreted as a static
phase transition in the RMF limits. In turn, we expect to leverage the static picture of RMF limits
to infer purely dynamical features of metastable finite-size networks, such as the transition
rates between pseudo-equilibria.

This note is a comment on a recent article [Tsakmakidis, et al., Nat Commun 10 (2019)] that presents
a thought-provoking proposal to overcome the bandwidth restrictions of invisibility cloaks based
on using media that support superluminal (faster than light in free space) group and phase velocities.
As illustrated in Fig. 1 of the original article, a wave packet propagating through such a fast-light
cloak is alleged to be able to reach the side behind the cloaked object simultaneously with a corresponding
wave packet propagating through the shorter, direct route in free space without the object, so that
"no shadow or waveform distortion arises." As the authors claim, the "extra pathlength is balanced
out by the correspondingly larger group velocity of the pulse in the cloak", which allows to "restore
the incident field distribution all around the object in, both, amplitude and phase". This fast-light
effect may be achieved in a broadband fashion using active (gain) materials. The authors claim that
such a fast-light cloak can hide an object, even from time-of-flight detection techniques, and
achieve invisibility "over any desired frequency band." We disagree with these claims and believe
that a thorough clarification of the ideas put forward in the original article is important and necessary
for the broad wave-physics community. Specifically, in this comment we clarify that invisibility
cloaks based on fast-light media suffer from fundamental bandwidth restrictions that arise due
to causality, the nature of superluminal wave propagation, and the stability issues of active systems.
These limitations and issues were not addressed in [Tsakmakidis, et al., Nat Commun 10 (2019)].
Most importantly, we show that the material model considered in the original article is unphysical.

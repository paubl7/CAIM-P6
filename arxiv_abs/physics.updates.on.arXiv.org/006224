Purpose: To experimentally validate the Fastcat cone beam CT (CBCT) simulator against kV and MV
CBCT images acquired with a Varian Truebeam linac. Methods: kV and MV CBCT images of a Catphan 504
phantom were acquired using a 100 kVp beam with the on-board imager (OBI) and a 6 MV treatment beam
with the electronic portal imaging device (EPID), respectively. The kV Fastcat simulation was
performed using detailed models of the x-ray source, bowtie filter, a high resolution voxelized
virtual Catphan phantom, anti-scatter grid, and the CsI scintillating detector. Likewise, an
MV Fastcat CBCT was simulated with detailed models for the beam energy spectrum, flattening filter,
a high resolution voxelized virtual Catphan phantom, and the GOS scintillating detector. Experimental
and simulated CBCT images of the phantom were compared with respect to HU values, contrast to noise
ratio (CNR),and dose linearity. Detector modulation transfer function (MTF) for the two detectors
were also experimentally validated. Fastcat's dose calculations were compared to MC dose calculations
performed with Topas. Results: For the kV and MV simulations, respectively: Contrast agreed within
14 and 9 HUs and detector MTF agreed within 4.2% and 2.5%. Likewise, CNR had a root mean squared error
(RMSE) of 2.6% and 1.4%. Dose agreed within 2.4% and 1.6% of MC values. The kV and MV CBCT images took
71 and 72 seconds to simulate in Fastcat with 887 and 493 projections, respectively. Conclusions:
We present a multi energy experimental validation of a fast and accurate CBCT simulator against
a commercial linac. The simulator is open source and all models found in this work can be downloaded

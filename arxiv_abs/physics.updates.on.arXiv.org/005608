The primary mode of respiratory virus transmission is by means of virus-laden aerosols. The aerosols
are inhaled into the respiratory tract and deposited in the mucosa, where the virus may interact
with the epithelial tissue causing infection. Transport of virus within the respiratory tract,
and its clearance from the lungs, is extremely important to limit the chance of an infection. In this
work, these phenomena are mathematically modelled using a coupled model of aerosol transport and
virus transport within a Weibel-like idealisation of the lung geometry. The analysis is carried
out in a dimensionless form and the results are presented in terms of various non-dimensional parameters.
It is observed that the main factor determining virus transport and clearance from the lungs is the
location of deposition of the virus-laden aerosols. Viruses deposited in the upper respiratory
tract are cleared out of the lung relatively faster by mucociliary clearance. Viruses deposited
in the deep lung persist much longer due to weak diffusive transport and the absence of mucociliary
clearance. Deep lung deposition of viruses, thus, increases the likelihood of the viruses infecting
an individual. Deep lung deposition is observed to take place for a specific range of aerosol sizes.
Slower breathing and deep breaths are observed to promote deep lung deposition. Slower breathing
and faster mucus clearance are also observed to enhance virus clearance from the upper respiratory
tract. It is further observed that virus clearance from the deep lung can only be enhanced by increasing
virus diffusivity. This enhancement is, however, not substantial. It, thus, becomes imperative
to eliminate deep lung deposition of the viruses. Larger exposure durations are also observed to
result in substantially larger virus concentrations, which increases the clearance time and as
such, the risk of infection.

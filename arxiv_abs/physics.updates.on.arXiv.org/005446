The turbulent flow past a wall-mounted square cylinder with an aspect ratio of four was investigated
with the aid of Spalart-Allmaras improved delayed detached-eddy simulation (S-A IDDES) and proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD). The Reynolds number was equal to 12,000 (based on the free-stream
velocity and obstacle width). This study focused on analysing the vortical structure of the wake
and vortex shedding process along the obstacle height. A quantitative comparison of the first and
second-order flow statistics with the available experimental and direct numerical simulation
data was used to validate the numerical results. The numerical model coupled with the vortex method
(VM) of generating the turbulent inflow conditions could successfully reproduce the flow field
around and behind the obstacle with commendable accuracy. The flow structure and vortex shedding
characteristics near the wake formation region have been discussed in detail using time-averaged
and instantaneous flow parameters obtained from the simulation. Dipole type mean streamwise vortex
and half-loop hairpin instantaneous vortices with energetic motions were identified. A coherent
shedding structure was reported along the obstacle using two-point correlations. Two types of
vortex shedding intervals were identified, namely, low amplitude fluctuations (LAFs) and high
amplitude fluctuations (HAFs). The POD analysis of the wake showed that for the elevations between
0.25 to 0.5 of the obstacle height, the first two POD modes represent the alternating shedding and
the contribution to the kinetic energy is between 66.6% to 57.6%. A simple low-order model based
on the vortex-shedding phase angle and the spectrum of the time coefficients obtained from POD was
developed to predict the wake dynamics at the range of elevations where the alternating shedding
is dominated.

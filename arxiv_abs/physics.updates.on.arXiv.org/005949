The calculation of the anharmonic modes of small to medium sized molecules for assigning experimentally
measured frequencies to the corresponding type of molecular motions is computationally challenging
at sufficiently high levels of quantum chemical theory. Here, a practical and affordable way to
calculate coupled-cluster quality anharmonic frequencies using second order vibrational perturbation
theory (VPT2) from machine-learned models is presented. The approach, referred to as "NN + VPT2",
uses a high-dimensional neural network (PhysNet) to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) at
different levels of theory from which harmonic and VPT2 frequencies can be efficiently determined.
The NN + VPT2 approach is applied to eight small to medium sized molecules (H$_2$CO, trans-HONO,
HCOOH, CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$NO$_2$, CH$_3$COOH and CH$_3$CONH$_2$) and frequencies are
reported from NN-learned models at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ, CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ and CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12
levels of theory. For the largest molecules and at the highest levels of theory, transfer learning
(TL) is used to determine the necessary full-dimensional, near-equilibrium PESs. Overall, NN
+ VPT2 yields anharmonic frequencies to within 20 cm$^{-1}$ of experimentally determined frequencies
for close to 90 % of the modes for the highest quality PES available and to within 10 cm$^{-1}$ for more
than 60 % of the modes. For the MP2 PESs only around 60 % of the NN + VPT2 frequencies were within 20~cm$^{-1}$
of the experiment, with outliers up to 150 cm$^{-1}$ compared with experiment. It is also demonstrated
that the approach allows to provide correct assignments for strongly interacting modes such as
the OH bending and the OH torsional modes in formic acid monomer and the CO-stretch and OH-bend mode
in acetic acid.

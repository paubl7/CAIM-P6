The effects of El Ni\~no's two distinct flavors, East Pacific (EP) and Central Pacific (CP)/Modoki
El Ni\~no, on global climate variability have been studied intensively in recent years. Most of
these studies have made use of linear multivariate statistics or composite analysis. Especially
the former assumes the same type of linear statistical dependency to apply across different phases
of the El Ni\~no--Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which appears not necessarily a justified assumption.
Here, we statistically evaluate the likelihood of co-occurrences between very high or very low
seasonal precipitation sums over vast parts of the global land surface and the presence of the respective
EP and CP types of both, El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na (i.e., the positive and negative ENSO phases). By employing
event coincidence analysis, we uncover differential imprints of both flavors on strong wet/dry
patterns over distinct regions across the globe, which may severely affect, among others, agricultural
and biomass production or public health. We particularly find that EP periods significantly coincide
with hydrometeorological anomalies at larger spatial scales, whereas sparser patterns emerge
along with CP periods. Our statistical analysis confirms previously reported interrelations
for EP periods and uncovers additional distinct regional patterns of very high/low seasonal precipitation,
such as increased rainfall over Central Asia alongside CP periods that have to our knowledge not
been reported so far. Our results demonstrate that a thorough distinction of El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na
into their two respective flavors could be crucial for properly anticipating strong regional hydrometeorological
anomalies and associated ecological and socioeconomic impacts.

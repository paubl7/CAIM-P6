In this article we consider the problem to what extent the motion of gauge-charged matter that generates
the gravitational field can be arbitrary, as well as what equations are superimposed on the gauge
field due to conditions of compatibility of gravitational field equations. Considered problem
is analyzed from the point of view symmetry of the theory with respect to the generalized gauge deformed
groups without specification of Lagrangians. In particular it is shown, that the motion of uncharged
particles along geodesics of Riemannian space is inherent in an extremely wide range of theories
of gravity and is a consequence of the gauge translational invariance of these theories under the
condition of fulfilling equations of gravitational field. In the cause of gauge-charged particles,
the Lorentz force, generalized for gauge-charged matter, appears in equations of motion as a consequence
of the gauge symmetry of the theory under the condition of fulfilling equations of gravitational
and gauge fields. In addition, we found relationships of equations for some fields that follow from
the assumption about fulfilling of equations for other fields, for example, relationships of equations
of the gravitational field and the gauge field of internal symmetry which follow from the assumption
about fulfilling of equations of matter fields. In particular, we obtained the identity that generalizes
in the case of arbitrary gauge field (and in the presence of gauge-charged matter) the identity found
by Hilbert for the electromagnetic field. At the end of the article there is an Appendix, which briefly
describes the main provisions and facts from the theory of generalized gauge deformed groups and
presents the main ideas of a single group-theoretical interpretation of gauge fields of both external
(space-time) and internal symmetry, which is an alternative to their geometric interpretation.

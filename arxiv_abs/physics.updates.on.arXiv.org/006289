The relativistic theory of the time- and position-dependent energy and momentum densities of light
in glasses and other low-loss dispersive media, where different wavelengths of light propagate
at different phase velocities, has remained a largely unsolved challenge until now. This is astonishing
in view of the excellent theoretical understanding of Maxwell's equations and the abundant experimental
measurements of optical phenomena in dispersive media. The challenge is related to the complexity
of the interference patterns of partial waves and to the coupling of the field and medium dynamics
by the optical force. In this work, we use the mass-polariton theory of light [Phys. Rev. A 96, 063834
(2017)] to derive the stress-energy-momentum (SEM) tensors of the field and the dispersive medium.
Our starting point, the fundamental local conservation laws of energy and momentum, is close to
that of a recent theoretical work on light in dispersive media by Philbin [Phys. Rev. A 83, 013823
(2011)], which however, excludes the power-conversion and force density source terms describing
the coupling between the field and the medium. In the general inertial frame, we present the SEM tensors
in terms of Lorentz scalars, four-vectors, and field tensors that reflect in a transparent way the
Lorentz covariance of the theory. The SEM tensors of the field and the medium are symmetric, form-invariant,
and in full accordance with the covariance principle of the special theory of relativity. The SEM
tensor of the coupled field-medium state of light also has zero four-divergence. Therefore, light
in a dispersive medium has well-defined four-momentum and rest frame. The volume integrals of the
total energy and momentum densities of light agree with the model of mass-polariton quasiparticles
having a nonzero rest mass. The predictions of our work are directly accessible to experiments.

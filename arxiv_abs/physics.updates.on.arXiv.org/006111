Two-dimensional (2D) MoS$_2$ has been intensively investigated for its use in the fields of microelectronics,
nanoelectronics, and optoelectronics. However, intrinsic 2D MoS$_2$ is usually used as the n-type
semiconductor due to the unintentional sulphur vacancies and surface gas adsorption.The synthesis
and characterization of 2D MoS$_2$ semiconductor of p-type are crucial for the development of relevant
p-n junction devices, as well as the practical applications of 2D MoS$_2$ in the next-generation
CMOS integrated circuit. Here, we synthesize high-quality, wafer-scale, 2D p-type MoS$_2$ (Mo$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$S$_2$)
with various niobium (Nb) mole fractions from 0 to 7.6% by a creative two-step method. The dielectric
functions of 2D Mo1-xNbxS2 are accurately determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry. We find that
the increasing fraction of Nb dopant in 2D MoS$_2$ can modulate and promote the combination of A and
B exciton peaks of 2D MoS$_2$. The direct causes of this impurity-tunable combination are interpreted
as the joint influence of decreasing peak A and broadening peak B. We explain the broadening peak
B as the multiple transitions from the impurity-induced valance bands to the conductive band minimum
at K point of Brillouin zone by comparing and analyzing the simulated electronic structure of intrinsic
and 2D Nb-doped MoS$_2$. A p-type FET based on the 2D Nb-doped MoS$_2$ was fabricated for characterization,
and its working performance is expected to be adjustable as a function of concentration of Nb dopant
according to our theoretical research. Our study is informative for comprehending optical and
electronic properties of extrinsic 2D transitional metal dichalcogenides, which is important
and imperative for the development and optimization of corresponding photonics and optoelectronics
devices.

Metasurfaces are subwavelength-thick constructs, consisting of discrete meta-cells providing
discretized levels of phase accumulation that collectively approximate a designed optical functionality.
The meta-cells utilizing Pancharatnam-Berry phase with polarization-converting structures
produced encouraging implementations of optical components including metasurface lenses (metalenses).
However, a pending and fundamental problem of this approach is the low device efficiency that the
resulting metasurface components suffer, an unwanted side effect of large lattice constants that
are used for preventing inter-coupling of their meta-cells. Here, we propose and show that, instead
of such uncoupled unit cells with fixed periodicity, tightly coupled fabric of identical dielectric
nanopillars with continuously-tuned edge-to-edge distances make excellent and complete metasurface
elements. This paradigm shift enables the scatterers to interact with the incoming wave extremely
efficiently. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we showed an achromatic cylindrical metalens,
constructed from strongly coupled dielectric nanopillars of a single geometry as continuously-set
phase elements, working in the entirety 400-700 nm band. This metalens achieves over 85 percent
focusing efficiency in transmission mode across this spectral range. To combat polarization-sensitivity,
we found that stacking the nanopillars in a honeycomb lattice may be used for building up a polarization-independent
scatterer library. Finally, a circular metalens with polarization-independent operation and
achromatic focusing was obtained. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first account of a metasurface
architecture woven of identical nanopillars coupled into a lattice laterally constructed by seamlessly
bringing them in close proximity with carefully-tuned inter-cell distances.

To study acoustic wave propagation and the corresponding energy deposition in partially ionized
plasmas, we use a two-fluid computational model which treats neutrals and charged particles (electrons
and ions) as two separate fluids. This two-fluid model takes into account the ion-neutral collisions,
ionization and recombination, allowing us to investigate both the collisional and reactive interactions
between uncoupled ions and neutrals in the plasmas. In the present numerical simulations, the initial
density is specified to reach hydrostatic equilibrium, and as a comparison, chemical equilibrium
is also taken into account to provide a density profile that differs from typical hydrostatic equilibrium
profiles. External velocity drivers are then imposed to generate monochromatic acoustic waves.
As it is well known, the upwards propagating acoustic waves steepen in gravitationally stratified
plasmas due to the exponentially decreasing density, and they heat the plasmas in the nonlinear
regimes where kinetic energy is dissipated by shock waves and collisional interactions. In particular,
the lower ionization fraction resulting from the present initial chemical equilibrium significantly
enhances the heating efficiency. Moreover, the ionization process absorbs a significant amount
of energy, and the decoupling between ions and neutrals are also enhanced while considering ionization
and recombination. Therefore, simulations without considering ionization and recombination
may overestimate the overall heating effects but also underestimate the energy dissipation. The
results also suggest that a more accurate ionization and recombination model could be essential
for improving the modelling of partially ionized plasmas.

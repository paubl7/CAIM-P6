Radiotherapy inverse planning requires treatment planners to modify multiple parameters in the
objective function to produce clinically acceptable plans. Due to manual steps in this process,
plan quality can vary widely depending on planning time available and planner's skills. The purpose
of this study is to automate the inverse planning process to reduce active planning time while maintaining
plan quality. We propose a hyperparameter tuning approach for automated inverse planning, where
a treatment plan utility is maximized with respect to the limit dose parameters and weights of each
organ-at-risk (OAR) objective. Using 6 patient cases, we investigated the impact of the choice
of dose parameters, random and Bayesian search methods, and utility function form on planning time
and plan quality. For given parameters, the plan was optimized in RayStation, using the scripting
interface to obtain the dose distributions deliverable. We normalized all plans to have the same
target coverage and compared the OAR dose metrics in the automatically generated plans with those
in the manually generated clinical plans. Using 100 samples was found to produce satisfactory plan
quality, and the average planning time was 2.3 hours. The OAR doses in the automatically generated
plans were lower than the clinical plans by up to 76.8%. When the OAR doses were larger than the clinical
plans, they were still between 0.57% above and 98.9% below the limit doses, indicating they are clinically
acceptable. For a challenging case, a dimensionality reduction strategy produced a 92.9% higher
utility using only 38.5% of the time needed to optimize over the original problem. This study demonstrates
our hyperparameter tuning framework for automated inverse planning can significantly reduce
the treatment planner's planning time with plan quality that is similar to or better than manually
generated plans.

Previously we presented a numerical model that predicts trajectories of lunar dust, soil, and gravel
blown by the engine exhaust of a lunar lander. The model uses the gas density, velocity vector field,
and temperature predicted by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or Direct Simulation Monte Carlo
(DSMC) simulations to compute the forces and accelerations acting on the regolith particles, one
particle at a time (ignoring particle collisions until more advanced models are developed). Here
we present significant improvements to the model, including the implementation of particle drag
and lift formulas to account for the rarefaction and compressibility of the flow. It turns out that
the drag force is reduced due to the rarefaction, but the lift is increased due to several effects
such as particle rotation. A data matrix of particle sizes, engine thrusts (descent and ascent values
for Altair), horizontal and vertical starting distances, and lander height above ground, have
been tested using the latest version of the software. These results suggest that the previously
reported 3 degree trajectory angle limit can be exceeded in several cases by as much as a factor of
five. Particles that originate at a height of 1 cm above the surface from an outer crater rim can be
propelled to angles of 5 degrees or more. Particles that start at 10 cm above the surface can be ejected
with angles of up to 15 degrees. Mechanisms responsible for placing particles at starting heights
above the surface may include the kinetics of horizontal collisions, as suggested by Discrete Element
Method (DEM) simulations. We also present results showing the distance particles travel and their
impact velocities. We then use the model to evaluate the effectiveness of berms or other methods
to block the spray of soil at a lunar landing site.

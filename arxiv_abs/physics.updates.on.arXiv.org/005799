We derive the torque on a spheroid of an arbitrary aspect ratio $\kappa$ sedimenting in a linearly
stratified ambient. The analysis demarcates regions in parameter space corresponding to broadside-on
and edgewise (longside-on) settling in the limit $Re, Ri_v \ll 1$, where $Re = \rho_0UL/\mu$ and
$Ri_v =\gamma L^3g/\mu U$, the Reynolds and viscous Richardson numbers, respectively, are dimensionless
measures of the importance of inertial and buoyancy forces relative to viscous ones. Here, $L$ is
the spheroid semi-major axis, $U$ an appropriate settling velocity scale, $\mu$ the fluid viscosity,
and $\gamma\,(>0)$ the (constant)\,density gradient characterizing the stably stratified ambient,
with $\rho_0$ being the fluid density taken to be a constant within the Boussinesq framework. A reciprocal
theorem formulation identifies three contributions to the torque: (1) an $O(Re)$ inertial contribution
that already exists in a homogeneous ambient, and orients the spheroid broadside-on; (2) an $O(Ri_v)$
hydrostatic contribution due to the ambient linear stratification that also orients the spheroid
broadside-on; and (3) a hydrodynamic contribution arising from the perturbation of the ambient
stratification by the spheroid whose nature depends on $Pe$; $Pe = UL/D$ being the Peclet number
with $D$ the diffusivity of the stratifying agent. For $Pe \gg 1$, the hydrodynamic contribution
is $O(Ri_v^{\frac{2}{3}}$) in the Stokes stratification regime characterized by $Re \ll Ri_v^{\frac{1}{3}}$,
and orients the spheroid edgewise regardless of $\kappa$. The differing orientation dependencies
of the inertial and large-$Pe$ hydrodynamic stratification torques imply that the broadside-on
and edgewise settling regimes are separated by two distinct $\kappa$-dependent critical curves
in the $Ri_v/Re^{\frac{3}{2}}-\kappa$ plane. The predictions are consistent with recent experimental
observations.

The prevailing conceptual model for the production of severe local storm (SLS) environments over
North America asserts that upstream elevated terrain and the Gulf of Mexico are both essential to
their formation. This work tests this hypothesis using two prescribed-ocean climate model experiments
with North American topography removed or the Gulf of Mexico converted to land and analyzes how SLS
environments and associated synoptic-scale drivers (southerly Great Plains low-level jets,
drylines, elevated mixed layers, and extratropical cyclones) change relative to a control historical
run. Overall, SLS environments depend strongly on upstream elevated terrain but weakly on the Gulf
of Mexico. Removing elevated terrain substantially reduces SLS environments especially over
the continental interior due to broad reductions in both thermodynamic and kinematic parameters,
leaving a more zonally-uniform residual distribution that is maximized near the Gulf coast and
decays toward the continental interior. This response is associated with a strong reduction in
synoptic-scale drivers and a cooler and drier mean-state atmosphere. Replacing the Gulf of Mexico
with land modestly reduces SLS environments thermodynamically over the Great Plains and increases
them kinematically over the eastern U.S, shifting the primary local maximum eastward into Illinois;
it also eliminates the secondary, smaller local maximum over southern Texas. This response is associated
with modest changes in synoptic-scale drivers and a warmer and drier lower-tropospheric mean state.
These experiments provide insight into the role of elevated terrain and the Gulf of Mexico in modifying
the spatial distribution and seasonality of SLS environments.

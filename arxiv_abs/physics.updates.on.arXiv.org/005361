Power curve is widely used to estimate power output for planning and operational purposes. Existing
methods for constructing power curves have three main limitations: (i) they mostly rely on wind
speed as the sole input, thus ignoring the secondary, yet possibly significant effects of other
environmental factors, (ii) they largely overlook the complex marine environment in which offshore
wind turbines operate, potentially compromising their value in offshore wind energy applications,
and (ii) they solely focus on the first-order properties of wind power, with little information
about the variation around the mean behavior, which is important for ensuring reliable grid integration,
asset health monitoring, and energy storage, among others. In light of that, this study investigates
the impact of several wind- and wave-related factors on offshore wind power variability, with the
ultimate goal of accurately predicting its first two moments. Our approach couples OpenFAST-a
high-fidelity stochastic multi-physics simulator-with Gaussian Process (GP) regression to
reveal the underlying relationships governing offshore weather-to-power conversion. We find
that a multi-input power curve which captures the combined impact of wind speed, direction, and
air density, can provide double-digit improvements relative to univariate methods which rely
on wind speed as the sole explanatory variable. Wave-related variables are found not important
for predicting the average power output, but appear to be extremely relevant in describing the fluctuation
of the offshore power around its mean. Tested on real-world data collected at the New York/New Jersey
bight, our proposed multi-input models demonstrate a high explanatory power in predicting the
first two moments of offshore wind power, testifying their potential value to the offshore wind
industry.

Elucidating the mechanisms that lead to cooperation is still one of the main scientific challenges
of current times, as many common cooperative scenarios remain elusive and at odds with Darwin's
natural selection theory. Here, we study evolutionary games on populations that are structured
beyond pairwise interactions. Specifically, we introduce a general evolutionary approach that
allows studying situations in which indirect interactions via a neighbor other than the direct
pairwise connection (or via a group of neighbors), impact the strategy of the focal player. To this
end, we consider simplicial graphs that encode two- and three-body interactions, which enables
to study competition between all possible pairs of social dilemmas and to scrutinize the role of
three-body interactions in all the observed phenomenology. We simultaneously investigate how
social dilemma with different Nash equilibria compete in simplicial structures and how such a competition
is modulated by the unbalance of 2- and 1-simplices, which in its turn reflects the relative prevalence
of pairwise or group interactions among the players. We report a number of results that: (i) support
that higher-order games allow for non-dominant strategists to emerge and coexist with dominant
ones, a scenario that can't be explained by any pairwise schemes, no matter the network of contacts;
(ii) characterize a novel transition from dominant defection to dominant cooperation as a function
of the simplicial structure of the population; and (iii) demonstrate that 2-simplex interactions
are a source of strategy diversity, i.e. increasing the relative prevalence of group interactions
always promotes diverse strategic identities of individuals. Our study constitutes a step forward
in the quest for understanding the roots of cooperation and the mechanisms that sustain it in real-world
and social environments.

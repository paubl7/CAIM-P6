Influence competition finds its significance in many applications, such as marketing, politics
and public events like COVID-19. Existing work tends to believe that the stronger influence will
always win and dominate nearly the whole network, i.e., "winner takes all". However, this finding
somewhat contradicts with our common sense that many competing products are actually coexistent,
e.g., Android vs. iOS. This contradiction naturally raises the question: will the winner take all?
To answer this question, we make a comprehensive study into influence competition by identifying
two factors frequently overlooked by prior art: (1) the incomplete observation of real diffusion
networks; (2) the existence of information overload and its impact on user behaviors. To this end,
we attempt to recover possible diffusion links based on user similarities, which are extracted
by embedding users into a latent space. Following this, we further derive the condition under which
users will be overloaded, and formulate the competing processes where users' behaviors differ
before and after information overload. By establishing the explicit expressions of competing
dynamics, we disclose that information overload acts as the critical "boundary line", before which
the "winner takes all" phenomenon will definitively occur, whereas after information overload
the share of influences gradually stabilizes and is jointly affected by their initial spreading
conditions, influence powers and the advent of overload. Numerous experiments are conducted to
validate our theoretical results where favorable agreement is found. Our work sheds light on the
intrinsic driving forces behind real-world dynamics, thus providing useful insights into effective
information engineering.

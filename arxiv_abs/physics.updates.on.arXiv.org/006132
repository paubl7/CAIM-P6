Organic molecules with nonlinear optical behavior have advanced a wide range of fields spanning
from integrated photonics to biological imaging. With advances in microscopy, an emerging application
is multifunctional nonlinear organic imaging agents. Unlike conventional imaging probes which
simply emit light through single or multi photon processes, multifunctional materials allow systems
to be simultaneously imaged and controlled. In this work, we report a multifunctional molecular
probe for modulating and reporting electric fields. The probe molecule consists of two distinct
functional modules which are connected by a long alkyl chain. The electric field detector module
relies on the two-photon (2p) imaging agent and photo-induced electron transfer (PeT) dye, TPE.
Two-photon imaging agents have demonstrated less damage and larger penetration depths in cells
and live tissue imaging. The electric field modulator module relies on the organic photoconductor,
NAI. To reduce cross-talk and optimize absorption and emission wavelengths, the molecular structure
is first studied using density functional theory modeling, and then the multi-functional molecular
probe is synthesized. The photophysical, photoconductivity, and biotoxicity of the probe molecule
are studied in a range of solvents and solid state, and the results agree with the theoretical predictions.
Specifically, 2p excitation in a biocompatible solvent is demonstrated, the photoconductivity
is rapid and reversible, and the material has low cytotoxicity. Additionally, the entire system
is optically controlled, including signal read-out, and the two modules can be operated simultaneously
or individually. This work sets the stage for modulation and detection of bioelectric fields in
a range of cell and tissue types.

This work presents a formalism to improve the predictive accuracy of physical models by learning
generalizable augmentations from sparse data. The proposed approach, referred to as Learning
and Inference assisted by Feature Engineering (LIFE), is based on the hypothesis that robustness
and generalizability demand a meticulously-designed feature space that is informed by the underlying
physics, and a carefully constructed features-to-augmentation map. The critical components
of this approach are : (1)Identification of relevant physics-informed features in appropriate
functional forms to enable significant overlap in feature space for a wide variety of cases to promote
generalizability; (2) Explicit control over feature space to locally infer the augmentation without
affecting other feature space regions, especially when limited data is available; (3) Maintaining
consistency across the learning and prediction environments to make the augmentation case-agnostic;
(4) Tightly-coupled inference and learning by constraining the augmentation to be learnable throughout
the inference process to avoid significant loss of information (and hence accuracy). To demonstrate
the viability of this approach, it is used in the modeling of bypass transition. The augmentation
is developed on skin friction data from two flat plate cases from the ERCOFTAC dataset. The augmented
model is then applied to a variety of flat plate cases which are characterized by different freestream
turbulence intensities, pressure gradients, and Reynolds numbers. The predictive capability
of the augmented model is also tested on single-stage high-pressure-turbine cascade cases, and
the model performance is analyzed from the perspective of information contained in the feature
space. The results show consistent improvements across these cases, as long as the physical phenomena
in question are well-represented in the training.

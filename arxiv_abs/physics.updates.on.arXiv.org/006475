The Multiple Mapping Conditioning / Large Eddy Simulation (MMC-LES) approach is used to simulate
a supersonic lifted hydrogen jet flame, which features shock-induced autoignition, shock-flame
interaction, lifted flame stabilization, and finite-rate chemistry effects. The shocks and expansion
waves, shock-reaction interactions and overall flame characteristics are accurately reproduced
by the model. Predictions are compared with the detailed experimental data for the mean axial velocity,
mean and root-mean-square temperature, species mole fractions, and mixture fraction at various
locations. The predicted and experimentally observed flame structures are compared through scatter
plots of species mole fractions and temperature against mixture fraction. Unlike most past MMC-LES
which has been applied to low-Mach flames, in this supersonic flame case pressure work and viscous
heating are included in the stochastic FDF equations. Analysis indicates that the pressure work
plays an important role in autoignition induction and flame stabilization, whereas viscous heating
is only significant in shear layers (but still negligibly small compared to the pressure work).
The evolutions of particle information subject to local gas dynamics are extracted through trajectory
analysis on representative fuel and oxidizer particles. The particles intermittently enter the
extinction region and may be deviated from the full burning or mixing lines under the effects of shocks,
expansion waves and viscous heating. The chemical explosive mode analysis performed on the Lagrangian
particles shows that temperature, the H and OH radicals contribute dominantly to CEM respectively
in the central fuel jet, fuel-rich and fuel-lean sides. The pronounced particle Damk\"ohler numbers
first occur in the fuel jet / coflow shear layer, enhanced at the first shock intersection point and
peak around the flame stabilization point.

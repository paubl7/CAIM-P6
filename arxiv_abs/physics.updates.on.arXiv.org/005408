We derive expressions for the leading-order far-field flows generated by externally driven and
active (swimming) colloids at planar fluid-fluid interfaces. We consider colloids adjacent to
the interface or adhered to the interface with a pinned contact line. The Reynolds and capillary
numbers are assumed much less than unity, in line with typical micron-scale colloids involving
air- or alkane-aqueous interfaces. For driven colloids, the leading-order flow is given by the
point-force (and/or torque) response of this system. For active colloids, the force-dipole (stresslet)
response occurs at leading order. At clean (surfactant-free) interfaces, these hydrodynamic
modes are essentially a restricted set of the usual Stokes multipoles in a bulk fluid. To leading
order, driven colloids exert Stokeslets parallel to the interface, while active colloids drive
differently oriented stresslets depending on the colloid's orientation. We then consider how
these modes are altered by the presence of an incompressible interface, a typical circumstance
for colloidal systems at small capillary numbers in the presence of surfactant. The leading-order
modes for driven and active colloids are restructured dramatically. For driven colloids, interfacial
incompressibility substantially weakens the far-field flow normal to the interface; the point-force
response drives flow only parallel to the interface. However, Marangoni stresses induce a new dipolar
mode, which lacks an analogue on a clean interface. Surface-viscous stresses, if present, potentially
generate very long-ranged flow on the interface and the surrounding fluids. Our results have important
implications for colloid assembly and advective mass transport enhancement near fluid boundaries.

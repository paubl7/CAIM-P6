In a continuum dislocation dynamics formulation by Xia and El-Azab, dislocations are represented
by a set of vector density fields, one per crystallographic slip systems. The space-time evolution
of these densities is obtained by solving a set of dislocation transport equations coupled with
crystal mechanics. Here, we present an approach for incorporating dislocation annihilation and
junction reactions into the dislocation transport equations. These reactions consume dislocations
and result in nothing as in the annihilation reactions, or produce new dislocations of different
types as in the case of junction reactions. Collinear annihilation, glissile junctions, and sessile
junctions are particularly emphasized here. A generalized energy-based criterion for junction
reactions is established in terms of the dislocation density and Burgers vectors of the reacting
species, and the reaction rate terms for junction reactions are formulated in terms of the dislocation
densities. In order to illustrate how the dislocation network changes as a result of junction formation
and annihilation in a continuum dislocation dynamics setting, we present some numerical examples
focusing on the reactions processes themselves. The results show that our modeling approach is
able to capture the respective dislocation network changes associated with dislocation reactions
in FCC crystals: dislocations of opposite line directions encountering each other on collinear
slip systems annihilate to connect the dislocations on the two slip systems, glissile junctions
form on new slip system behave like Frank-Read sources, and sessile junctions form and expand along
the intersection of the slip planes of the reacting dislocation species. A collective-dynamics
test showing the frequency of occurrence of junctions of different types relative to each other
is also presented.

Series of experiments on turbulent bubbly channel flows observed bubble clusters near the wall
which can change large-scale flow structures. To gain insights into clustering mechanisms, we
study the interaction of a pair of spherical bubbles rising in a vertical channel through combined
experiments and modeling. Experimental imaging identifies that pairwise bubbles of 1.0 mm diameter
take two preferred configurations depending on their mutual distance: side-by-side positions
for a short distance ($S<5$) and nearly inline, oblique positions for a long distance ($S>5$), where
$S$ is the mutual distance normalized by the bubble radius. In the model, we formulate the motions
of pairwise bubbles rising at $Re=O(100)$. Analytical drag and lift, and semi-empirical, spatio-temporal
stochastic forcing are employed to represent the mean acceleration and the fluctuation due to turbulent
agitation, respectively. The model is validated against the experiment through comparing Lagrangian
statistics of the bubbles. Simulations using this model identify two distinct timescales of interaction
dynamics which elucidate the preferred configurations. For pairs initially in-line, the trailing
bubble rapidly escapes from the viscous wake of the leading bubble to take the oblique position.
Outside of the wake, the trailing bubble travels on a curve-line path with a slower velocity driven
by potential interaction and horizontally approaches the leading bubble to become side-by-side.
Moreover, statistical analysis identifies that the combination of the wake and the agitation can
significantly accelerate the side-by-side clustering of in-line pairs. These results indicate
positive contributions of liquid viscosity and turbulence to the formation of bubble clusters.

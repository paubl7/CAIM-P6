Due to the rate at which the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading, a model for indoors airborne transmission
that is quick to implement is required. We create such a model assuming that the concentration of
airborne infectious particles is governed by an advection-diffusion-reaction equation. As schools
and universities are intensively discussing how to operate their indoor spaces, we solve the model
for a classroom, assuming one infectious person at the centre of the room and quantify the effect
of several ventilation settings when the person is breathing or talking, both with and without a
face mask. We compare our model with more complex models and with experimental data and find good
agreement. The framework can be easily applied to any other high-risk location. We also generate
maps of the Time To Infection (TTI) by airborne transmission, for various activities and ventilation
levels. Using the TTI maps we quantify the airborne transmission risk and make recommendations
for the Safe Occupancy Time (SOT), for a chosen risk tolerance level. As expected, we find that the
SOT decreases with ventilation quality. We also establish the recommended "vacancy time" after
an activity in the room. For example, to achieve an airborne transmission risk of less than 5%, the
pre-pandemic ASHRAE recommended ventilation would allow 37-minute lessons followed by 35-minute
breaks but if the ventilation is poor, 25-minute lessons should be followed by 166-minute breaks.
Our model also uncovers power-law relationships for the concentration as a function of time and
particle emission rate and for the TTI as a function of ventilation rate and particle emission rate;
these may be used as a fast tool to predict the SOT in several realistic scenarios. Finally, we show
that wearing a mask of 50% efficiency could increase the SOT by 98% and reduce the vacancy time by up
to 55%, depending on the ventilation setting.

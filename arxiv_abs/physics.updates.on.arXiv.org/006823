Purpose: The XCAT phantom allows for highly sophisticated multimodality imaging research. It
includes a complete set of organs, muscle, bone, soft tissue, while also accounting for age, sex,
and body mass index (BMI), which allows phantom studies to be performed at a population scale. At
the same time, the XCAT phantom does not currently include the lymphatic system, critical for evaluating
bulky nodal malignancies in lymphoma. We aimed to incorporate a full lymphatic system into the XCAT
phantom and to generate realistic simulated images via guidance from lymphoma patient studies.
Methods: A template lymphatic system was extended based on known anatomy was used to define 276 lymph
nodes and corresponding vessels using non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) surfaces. Lymph
node properties were modified using the Rhinoceros 3D viewing software. The XCAT general parameter
script was used to input organ concentrations and generate binary files with uptake and attenuation
information. Results: Lymph nodes can be scaled, stretched, and translated within the intuitive
Rhinoceros interface, to allow for realistic simulation of different lymph node pathologies.
Bulky, heterogeneous PMBCL tumours were generated in the mediastinum using expanded lymph nodes.
Our results suggest that optimized thresholding provides better accuracy for determining total
metabolic tumour volume (TMTV) of PMBCL tumours, while the gradient method was most accurate for
total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Conclusions: An upgraded XCAT phantom with a fully simulated lymphatic
system was created. Distributed to the research community, the XCAT phantom with the new lymphatic
system has the potential of enabling studies to optimize image quality and quantitation, towards
improved assessment of lymphoma including predictive modeling (e.g. improved TMTV and radiomics
research).

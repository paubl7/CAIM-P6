Processes that lead to the critical-current suppression and change of impedance of a superconductor
under the application of an external voltage is an active area of research, especially due to various
possible technological applications. In particular, field-effect transistors and radiation
detectors have been developed in the recent years, showing the potential for precision and sensitivity
exceeding their normal-metal counterparts. In order to describe the phenomenon that leads to the
critical-current suppression in metallic superconducting structures, a field-effect hypothesis
has been formulated, stating that an electric field can penetrate the metallic superconductor
and affect its characteristics. The existence of such an effect would imply the incompleteness
of the underlying theory, and hence indicate an important gap in the general comprehension of superconductors.
In addition to its theoretical value, a complete understanding of the phenomenon underneath the
electric-field response of the superconductor is important in the light of the related technological
applications. In this paper, we study the change of the characteristics of a superconductor implementing
a coplanar-waveguide resonator as a tank circuit, by relating our measurements to the reactance
and resistance of the material. Namely, we track the state of the superconductor at different voltages
and resulting currents of a nearby gate electrode which is not galvanically connected to the resonator.
By comparing the effects of the voltage and of a change in the temperature of the system, we conclude
that the observed behaviour in the superconductor is caused by the heat that is deposited as quasiparticles
on the superconductor by the electric current induced by the electric field [...]

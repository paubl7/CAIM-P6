An exceptional point (EP) is a branch singularity where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a parametric
non-Hermitian operator coalesce. EPs have been extensively explored in quantum and optical systems.
This work aims to present a study of EPs associated with different operators in phononic crystals
(PC) and the related phenomena. The questions of existence of EPs and their physical manifestations
will be addressed with particular focus on symmetry considerations and scattering behavior. Discrete
spring-mass models with adjustable parameters are used here to elucidate the discussion in the
most fundamental form. Specific phenomena associated with EPs in the eigenfrequency band structure
are presented. The scattering analysis of finite resonator arrays is studied as well. General formulas
of the transfer and scattering matrices are used for 1D linear discrete systems to provide practical
insights on the effects of reciprocity and fundamental symmetries. We explicitly address the effects
of reciprocity, $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$, and $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetries on the transfer
and scattering matrices, which can be used as the basis for generalization in continuous media.
We present two special scattering examples, which are associated with the EPs of the dynamic matrix
and scattering matrix, respectively. In the first example, the PC sample may be tuned to become completely
undetectable from both directions at a certain frequency. In the second example, the PC sample possesses
$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry and features one-way reflection. The EPs of its scattering matrix are
associated with phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry breaking. This theoretical investigation
of EPs will reinforce fundamental understandings of the related phenomena in the mechanical context,
which are suggested for novel applications of micro-structured media such as wave filtering and
robust sensing.

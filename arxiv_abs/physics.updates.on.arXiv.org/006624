We present OrbNet Denali, a machine learning model for electronic structure that is designed as
a drop-in replacement for ground-state density functional theory (DFT) energy calculations.
The model is a message-passing neural network that uses symmetry-adapted atomic orbital features
from a low-cost quantum calculation to predict the energy of a molecule. OrbNet Denali is trained
on a vast dataset of 2.3 million DFT calculations on molecules and geometries. This dataset covers
the most common elements in bio- and organic chemistry (H, Li, B, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca,
Br, I) as well as charged molecules. OrbNet Denali is demonstrated on several well-established
benchmark datasets, and we find that it provides accuracy that is on par with modern DFT methods while
offering a speedup of up to three orders of magnitude. For the GMTKN55 benchmark set, OrbNet Denali
achieves WTMAD-1 and WTMAD-2 scores of 7.19 and 9.84, on par with modern DFT functionals. For several
GMTKN55 subsets, which contain chemical problems that are not present in the training set, OrbNet
Denali produces a mean absolute error comparable to those of DFT methods. For the Hutchison conformers
benchmark set, OrbNet Denali has a median correlation coefficient of R^2=0.90 compared to the reference
DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculation, and R^2=0.97 compared to the method used to generate the training data
(wB97X-D3/def2-TZVP), exceeding the performance of any other method with a similar cost. Similarly,
the model reaches chemical accuracy for non-covalent interactions in the S66x10 dataset. For torsional
profiles, OrbNet Denali reproduces the torsion profiles of wB97X-D3/def2-TZVP with an average
MAE of 0.12 kcal/mol for the potential energy surfaces of the diverse fragments in the TorsionNet500
dataset.

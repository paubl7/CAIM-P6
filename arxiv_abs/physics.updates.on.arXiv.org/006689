Purpose: To develop an automated machine-learning-based method for the discovery of rapid and
quantitative chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MR fingerprinting acquisition and
reconstruction protocols. Methods: An MR physics governed AI system was trained to generate optimized
acquisition schedules and the corresponding quantitative reconstruction neural-network. The
system (termed AutoCEST) is composed of a CEST saturation block, a spin dynamics module, and a deep
reconstruction network, all differentiable and jointly connected. The method was validated using
a variety of chemical exchange phantoms and an in-vivo mouse brain at 9.4T. Results: The acquisition
times for AutoCEST optimized schedules ranged from 35-71s, with a quantitative image reconstruction
time of only 29 ms. The resulting exchangeable proton concentration maps for the phantoms were in
good agreement with the known solute concentrations for AutoCEST sequences (mean absolute error
= 2.42 mM; Pearson's r=0.992 , p$<$0.0001), but not for an unoptimized sequence (mean absolute error
= 65.19 mM; Pearson's r=-0.161, p=0.522). Similarly, improved exchange rate agreement was observed
between AutoCEST and quantification of exchange using saturation power (QUESP) methods (mean
absolute error: 35.8 Hz, Pearson's r=0.971, p$<$0.0001) compared to an unoptimized schedule and
QUESP (mean absolute error = 58.2 Hz; Pearson's r=0.959, p$<$0.0001). The AutoCEST in-vivo mouse
brain semi-solid proton volume-fractions were lower in the cortex (12.21$\pm$1.37%) compared
to the white-matter (19.73 $\pm$ 3.30%), as expected, and the amide proton volume-fraction and
exchange rates agreed with previous reports. Conclusion: AutoCEST can automatically generate
optimized CEST/MT acquisition protocols that can be rapidly reconstructed into quantitative
exchange parameter maps.

Liquid metal ion sources (LMIS) are widely used in applications ranging from local ion implantation
in semiconductors, to focused ion beam systems for milling and nanolithography, to space micropropulsion
devices being developed by NASA. Above a critically large field strength, an electrically stressed
liquid metal develops one or more cuspidal protrusions which undergo accelerated conic tip sharpening
with runaway field self-enhancement. Zubarev (2001) first predicted from an inviscid model that
the electric stresses at the liquid apex undergo self-similar divergent growth in finite time.
The inviscid assumption is appropriate to liquid metals since the viscous boundary layer extends
only a few tens of nanometers from the moving interface. In this work, we examine in more depth a two-parameter
family of far-field self-similar solutions incorporating inertial, electrical and capillary
effects, which to leading order describe electric and velocity potential fields corresponding
to a rapidly accelerating \textit{dynamic} Taylor cone. These far field solutions are incorporated
self-consistently into boundary integral simulations which reveal the entire liquid shape in
the near field. By invoking time reversal symmetry inherent to inviscid flow, we unmask an entire
family of novel self-similar conic modes exhibiting features such as inertial recoil, tip bulging
from accelerated advance and tip counter-current flow as well as multiple interface stagnation
points. These dynamic configurations help explain for the first time the origin of decades old experimental
observations that have reported phenomena such as tip oscillation, pulsation and breakup during
operation. The various liquid tip shapes accessible to such systems should help correct persistent
misconceptions of pre- and post-emission behavior in LMIS systems and related technologies.

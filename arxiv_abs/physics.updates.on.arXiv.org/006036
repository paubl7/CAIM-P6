The collision rate of particles suspended in turbulent flow is critical to particle agglomeration
and droplet coalescence. The collision kernel can be evaluated by the radial distribution function
(RDF) and radial relative velocity (RV) between particles at small separations $r$. Previously,
the smallest $r$ was limited to roughly the Kolmogorov length $\eta$ due to particle position uncertainty
and image overlap. We report a new approach to measure RDF and RV near contact ($r/a\: \approx$ 2.07,
$a$ particle radius) overcoming these limitations. Three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry
using four-pulse Shake-the-Box algorithm recorded short particle tracks with the interpolated
midpoints registered as particle positions to avoid image overlap. This strategy further allows
removal of mismatched tracks using their characteristic false RV. We measured RDF and RV in a one-meter-diameter
isotropic turbulence chamber with Taylor Reynolds number $Re_\lambda=324$ with particles of
12-16 $\mu$m radius and Stokes number $\approx$ 0.7. While at large $r$ the measured RV agrees with
the literature, when $r<20\eta$ the first moment of negative RV is 10 times higher than direct numerical
simulations of non-interacting particles. Likewise, when $r>\eta$, RDF scales as $r^{-0.39}$
reflecting RDF scaling for polydisperse particles in the literature , but when $r\lessapprox\eta$
RDF scales as $r^{-6}$, yielding 1000 times higher near-contact RDF than simulations. Such extreme
clustering and relative velocity enhancement can be attributed to particle-particle interactions.
Uncertainty analysis substantiates the observed trends. This first-ever simultaneous RDF and
RV measurement at small separations provides a clear glimpse into the clustering and relative velocities
of particles in turbulence near-contact.

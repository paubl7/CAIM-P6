One of the greatest needs in modern ophthalmology is access to the eye choroid in vivo. Without it,
it is difficult to introduce new therapies and to understand most of the pathological changes in
the eye, because of the total blood flow in the eye is caused by the choroidal circulation. It is entirely
responsible for the metabolism of photoreceptors, which each of us feels every day and senses when
its deficits begin. Optical selection of choroid and choriocapillaris by currently used imaging
techniques such as indocyanine angiography, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy or optical coherence
tomography (OCT) is limited by insufficient lateral resolution, depth of penetration and the presence
of strong light scattering effects. Here we report a Spatio-Temporal Optical Coherence Tomography
(STOC-T) that maintains microscopic quality of in vivo reconstructions of anatomical layers when
imaging chorioretinal cross-sections in a coronal anatomic plane. STOC-T performs high definition
volumetric imaging in all projections, enabling reconstruction of anatomical details of the retinal
and choroidal layers with unprecedented quality by using an extra phase randomization for low spatial
coherence. We also demonstrate that STOC-T can detect blood flow and reveal vascular networks in
various chorioretinal layers that are otherwise invisible to OCT. This capability highlights
the unique value of STOC-T angiography. These technical advances enable acquisition of detailed
choroidal structures, such as Satller layer and choriocapillaris, that are usually buried behind
speckle noise and blurred by eye motion artifacts in conventional OCT. By imaging the retina and
choroid with high contrast, we were able to perform detailed morphometric analysis, which is the
basis for the anticipated clinical utility of the method in monitoring disease progression and
therapeutic responses of the eye.

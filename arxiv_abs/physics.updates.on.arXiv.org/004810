Nuclear material deposited in equipment, transfer lines, and ventilation systems of a processing
facility is usually referred to as holdup. In this work, we propose to use an array of detectors co-axial
to the inspected pipe to measure the holdup material. This method is implementable into an automated
system capable of crawling on surfaces and pipes of various curvatures, which would enable faster,
easier, and more accurate holdup safeguards measurements. We first demonstrated that the current
holdup assay procedure could lead to a non-negligible bias in the estimate of special nuclear material
mass, due to the simplified assumption of deposited geometry introduced by the Generalized Geometry
Holdup (GGH) model. The new approach consists of imaging the inner holdup material by characterizing
the detector array's response and unfolding it from the measured light output. Our experimental
proof of principle consists of three NaI(Tl) detectors surrounding an aluminum pipe containing
two cesium-137( 137Cs) sources. We derived the source distribution inside the pipe by first calculating
the detector response matrix using a method adaptive to the surface geometry of the object containing
the measured holdup material. Creating a matrix of the detector array's measured counts, we then
proceed to solve an inverse problem, resulting in an accurately located source position and activity
distribution within the response matrix's spatial resolution. We then developed a simulated model
of the envisioned experimental setup, which accurately described both the activity and position
of the source in 2D. Finally, we extended our model onto a discretized three-dimensional model of
the system, encompassing 36 detectors. For the 3D simulation of four different source geometries,
the model accurately localized the source position in 3D, while the activity retained a maximum
relative error of +-5.32%.

Segmentation and analysis of individual pores and grains of mudrocks from scanning electron microscope
images is non-trivial because of noise, imaging artifacts, variation in pixel grayscale values
across images, and overlaps in grayscale values among different physical features such as silt
grains, clay grains, and pores in an image, which make their identification difficult. Moreover,
because grains and pores often have overlapping grayscale values, direct application of threshold-based
segmentation techniques is not sufficient. Recent advances in the field of computer vision have
made it easier and faster to segment images and identify multiple occurrences of such features in
an image, provided that ground-truth data for training the algorithm is available. Here, we propose
a deep learning SEM image segmentation model, MudrockNet based on Google's DeepLab-v3+ architecture
implemented with the TensorFlow library. The ground-truth data was obtained from an image-processing
workflow applied to scanning electron microscope images of uncemented muds from the Kumano Basin
offshore Japan at depths < 1.1 km. The trained deep learning model obtained a pixel-accuracy about
90%, and predictions for the test data obtained a mean intersection over union (IoU) of 0.6591 for
silt grains and 0.6642 for pores. We also compared our model with the random forest classifier using
trainable Weka segmentation in ImageJ, and it was observed that MudrockNet gave better predictions
for both silt grains and pores. The size, concentration, and spatial arrangement of the silt and
clay grains can affect the petrophysical properties of a mudrock, and an automated method to accurately
identify the different grains and pores in mudrocks can help improve reservoir and seal characterization
for petroleum exploration and anthropogenic waste sequestration.

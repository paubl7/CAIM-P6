We analyze a suspension of deformable particles in a pressure-driven flow. The suspension is composed
of neutrally buoyant initially spherical particles and a Newtonian carrier fluid, and the flow
is solved by means of direct numerical simulations, using a fully Eulerian method based on a one-continuum
formulation. The solid phase is modeled with an incompressible viscous hyperelastic constitutive
relation, and the flow is characterized by three main dimensionless parameters, namely the solid
volume fraction, the Reynolds and capillary numbers. The dependency of the effective viscosity
on these three quantities is investigated to study the inertial effects on a suspension of deformable
particles. It can be observed that the suspension has a shear-thinning behavior, and the reduction
in effective viscosity for high shear rates is emphasized in denser configurations. The separate
analysis of the Reynolds and capillary numbers reveal that the effective viscosity depends more
on the capillary than on the Reynolds number. In addition, our simulations exhibit a consistent
tendency for deformable particles to move towards the center of the channel, where the shear rate
is low. This phenomenon is particularly marked for very dilute suspensions, where a whole region
near the wall is empty of particles. Furthermore, when the volume fraction is increased this near-wall
region is gradually occupied, because of higher mutual particle interactions. Deformability
also plays an important role in the process. Indeed, at high capillary numbers, particles are more
sensitive to shear rate variations and can modify their shape more easily to accommodate a greater
number of particles in the central region of the channel.

Alchemical binding free energy (BFE) calculations offer an efficient and thermodynamically rigorous
approach to in silico binding affinity predictions. As a result of decades of methodological improvements
and recent advances in computer technology, alchemical BFE calculations are now widely used in
drug discovery research. They help guide the prioritization of candidate drug molecules by predicting
their binding affinities for a biomolecular target of interest (and potentially selectivity against
undesirable anti-targets). Statistical variance associated with such calculations, however,
may undermine the reliability of their predictions, introducing uncertainty both in ranking candidate
molecules and in benchmarking their predictive accuracy. Here, we present a computational method
that substantially improves the statistical precision in BFE calculations for a set of ligands
binding to a common receptor by dynamically allocating computational resources to different BFE
calculations according to an optimality objective established in a previous work from our group
and extended in this work. Our method, termed Network Binding Free Energy (NetBFE), performs adaptive
binding free energy calculations in iterations, re-optimizing the allocations in each iteration
based on the statistical variances estimated from previous iterations. Using examples of NetBFE
calculations for protein-binding of congeneric ligand series, we demonstrate that NetBFE approaches
the optimal allocation in a small number (<= 5) of iterations and that NetBFE reduces the statistical
variance in the binding free energy estimates by approximately a factor of two when compared to a
previously published and widely used allocation method at the same total computational cost.

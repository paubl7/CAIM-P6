An optical imaging system is proposed for quantitatively assessing jugular venous response to
altered central venous pressure. The proposed system assesses sub-surface optical absorption
changes from jugular venous waveforms with a spatial calibration procedure to normalize incident
tissue illumination. Widefield frames of the right lateral neck were captured and calibrated using
a novel flexible surface calibration method. A hemodynamic optical model was derived to quantify
jugular venous optical attenuation (JVA) signals, and generate a spatial jugular venous pulsatility
map. JVA was assessed in three cardiovascular protocols that altered central venous pressure:
acute central hypovolemia (lower body negative pressure), venous congestion (head-down tilt),
and impaired cardiac filling (Valsalva maneuver). JVA waveforms exhibited biphasic wave properties
consistent with jugular venous pulse dynamics when time-aligned with an electrocardiogram. JVA
correlated strongly (median, interquartile range) with invasive central venous pressure during
graded central hypovolemia (r=0.85, [0.72, 0.95]), graded venous congestion (r=0.94, [0.84,
0.99]), and impaired cardiac filling (r=0.94, [0.85, 0.99]). Reduced JVA during graded acute hypovolemia
was strongly correlated with reductions in stroke volume (SV) (r=0.85, [0.76, 0.92]) from baseline
(SV: 79$\pm$15mL, JVA: 0.56$\pm$0.10a.u.) to -40mmHg suction (SV: 59$\pm$18mL, JVA: 0.47$\pm$0.05a.u.;
p$<$0.01). The proposed non-contact optical imaging system demonstrated jugular venous dynamics
consistent with invasive central venous monitoring during three protocols that altered central
venous pressure. This system provides non-invasive monitoring of pressure-induced jugular venous
dynamics in clinically relevant conditions where catheterization is traditionally required,
enabling monitoring in non-surgical environments.

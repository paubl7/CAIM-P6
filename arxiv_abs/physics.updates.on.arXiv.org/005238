A subcritical route to turbulence via purely quasi-two-dimensional mechanisms, for a quasi-two-dimensional
system composed of an isolated exponential boundary layer, is numerically investigated. Exponential
boundary layers are highly stable, and are expected to form on the walls of liquid metal coolant ducts
within magnetic confinement fusion reactors. Subcritical transitions were detected only at weakly
subcritical Reynolds numbers (at most $\approx 70$% below critical). Furthermore, the likelihood
of transition was very sensitive to both the perturbation structure and initial energy. Only the
quasi-two-dimensional Tollmien-Schlichting wave disturbance, attained by either linear or
nonlinear optimisation, was able to initiate the transition process, by means of the Orr mechanism.
The lower initial energy bound sufficient to trigger transition was found to be independent of the
domain length. However, longer domains were able to increase the upper energy bound, via the merging
of repetitions of the Tollmien-Schlichting wave. This broadens the range of initial energies able
to exhibit transitional behaviour. Although the eventual relaminarization of all turbulent states
was observed, this was also greatly delayed in longer domains. The maximum nonlinear gains achieved
were orders of magnitude larger than the maximum linear gains (with the same initial perturbations),
regardless if the initial energy was above or below the lower energy bound. Nonlinearity provided
a second stage of energy growth by an arching of the conventional Tollmien-Schlichting wave structure.
A streamwise independent structure, able to efficiently store perturbation energy, also formed.

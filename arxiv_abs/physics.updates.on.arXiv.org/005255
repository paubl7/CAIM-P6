Epidemiological simulations as a method are used to better understand and predict the spreading
of infectious diseases, for example of COVID-19. This paper presents an approach that combines
person-centric data-driven human mobility modelling with a mechanistic infection model and a
person-centric disease progression model. The model includes the consequences of disease import,
of changed activity participation rates over time (coming from mobility data), of masks, of indoors
vs.\ outdoors leisure activities, and of contact tracing. Results show that the model is able to
credibly track the infection dynamics in Berlin (Germany). The model can be used to understand the
contributions of different activity types to the infection dynamics over time. The model clearly
shows the effects of contact reductions, school closures/vacations, or the effect of moving leisure
activities from outdoors to indoors in fall. Sensitivity tests show that all ingredients of the
model are necessary to track the current infection dynamics. One interesting result from the mobility
data is that behavioral changes of the population mostly happened \textit{before} the government-initiated
so-called contact ban came into effect. Similarly, people started drifting back to their normal
activity patterns \emph{before} the government officially reduced the contact ban. Our work shows
that is is possible to build detailed epidemiological simulations from microscopic mobility models
relatively quickly. They can be used to investigate mechanical aspects of the dynamics, such as
the transmission from political decisions via human behavior to infections, consequences of different
lockdown measures, consequences of wearing masks in certain situations, or contact tracing.

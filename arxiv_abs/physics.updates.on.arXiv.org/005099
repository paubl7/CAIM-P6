We explore the application of concepts developed in High Energy Physics (HEP) for advanced medical
data analysis. Our study case is a problem with high social impact: clinically-feasible Magnetic
Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF). MRF is a new, quantitative, imaging technique that replaces multiple
qualitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exams with a single, reproducible measurement for
increased sensitivity and efficiency. A fast acquisition is followed by a pattern matching (PM)
task, where signal responses are matched to entries from a dictionary of simulated, physically-feasible
responses, yielding multiple tissue parameters simultaneously. Each pixel signal response in
the volume is compared through scalar products with all dictionary entries to choose the best measurement
reproduction. MRF is limited by the PM processing time, which scales exponentially with the dictionary
dimensionality, i.e. with the number of tissue parameters to be reconstructed. We developed for
HEP a powerful, compact, embedded system, optimized for extremely fast PM. This system executes
real-time tracking for online event selection in the HEP experiments, exploiting maximum parallelism
and pipelining. Track reconstruction is executed in two steps. The Associative Memory (AM) ASIC
first implements a PM algorithm by recognizing track candidates at low resolution. The second step,
which is implemented into FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), refines the AM output finding
the track parameters at full resolution. We propose to use this system to perform MRF, to achieve
clinically reasonable reconstruction time. This paper proposes an adaptation of the HEP system
for medical imaging and shows some preliminary results.

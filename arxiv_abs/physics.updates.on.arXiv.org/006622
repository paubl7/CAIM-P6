The concept of 'complexity' plays a central role in complex network science. Traditionally, this
term has been taken to express heterogeneity of the node degrees of a therefore complex network.
However, given that the degree distribution is not enough to provide an invertible representation
of a given network, additional complementary measurements of its topology are required in order
to complement its characterization. In the present work, we aim at obtaining a new model of complex
networks, called hypercomplex networks - HC, that are characterized by heterogeneity not only
of the degree distribution, but also of a relatively complete set of complementary topological
measurements including node degree, shortest path length, clustering coefficient, betweenness
centrality, matching index, Laplacian eigenvalue and hierarchical node degree. The proposed
model starts with uniformly random networks, namely Erdos-Renyi structures, and then applies
optimization so as to increase an index of the overall complexity of the networks. An optimization
approach has been considered in terms of gradient descent. The complexity index expresses the dispersion
of the several considered measurements. Several interesting results are reported and discussed,
including the fact that the HC networks define, as the optimization proceeds, a trajectory in the
principal component space of the measurements that tends to depart from the considered theoretical
models (Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert, Waxman, Random Geometric Graph and Watts-Strogatz),
heading to a previously empty space (low density of cases). We observed that, after a considerably
large number of optimization steps, peripheral branching tends to appear that further enhances
the complexity of these networks.

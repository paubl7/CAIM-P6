Solid-state or crystal acceleration has for long been regarded as an attractive frontier in advanced
particle acceleration. However, experimental investigations of solid-state acceleration mechanisms
which offer $\rm TVm^{-1}$ acceleration gradients have been hampered by several technological
constraints. The primary constraint has been the unavailability of attosecond particle or photon
sources suitable for excitation of collective modes in bulk crystals. Secondly, there are significant
difficulties with direct high-intensity irradiation of bulk solids, such as beam instabilities
due to crystal imperfections and collisions etc. In this work, we model an experimentally practicable
solid-state acceleration mechanism using collective electron oscillations in crystals that
sustain propagating surface waves. These surface waves are driven in the wake of a submicron long
particle beam in tube shaped nanostructured crystals with tube wall densities, $n_{\rm tube}\sim10^{22-24}\rm
cm^{-3}$. Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations carried out under experimental constraints demonstrate
the possibility of accessing average acceleration gradients of several $\rm TVm^{-1}$ using the
solid-state tube wakefield acceleration regime. Furthermore, our modeling demonstrates the
possibility that as the surface oscillations and resultantly the surface wave transitions into
a nonlinear or "crunch-in" regime under $n_{\rm beam}/n_{\rm tube} \gtrsim 0.05$, not only does
the average gradient increase but strong transverse focusing fields extend down to the tube axis.
This work thus demonstrates the near-term experimental realizability of Solid-State Tube Wakefield
Accelerator (SOTWA). (truncated to comply with submission requirements)

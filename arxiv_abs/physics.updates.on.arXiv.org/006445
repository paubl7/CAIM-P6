The energy and flux budget (EFB) closure theory for a passive scalar (non-buoyant and non-inertial
particles or gaseous admixtures) is developed for stably stratified turbulence. The physical
background of the EFB turbulence closures is based on the budget equations for the turbulent kinetic
and potential energies and turbulent fluxes of momentum and buoyancy, as well as the turbulent flux
of particles. The EFB turbulence closure is designed for stratified geophysical flows from neutral
to very stable stratification and it implies that turbulence is maintained by the velocity shear
at any stratification. In a steady-state, expressions for the turbulent flux of passive scalar
and the anisotropic non-symmetric turbulent diffusion tensor are derived, and universal flux
Richardson number dependencies of the components of this tensor are obtained. The diagonal component
in the vertical direction of the turbulent diffusion tensor is suppressed by strong stratification,
while the diagonal components in the horizontal directions are not suppressed, and they are dominant
in comparison with the other components of turbulent diffusion tensor. This implies that any initially
created strongly inhomogeneous particle cloud is evolved into a thin pancake in horizontal plane
with very slow increase of its thickness in the vertical direction. The turbulent Schmidt number
increases linearly with the gradient Richardson number. Considering the applications of these
results to the atmospheric boundary-layer turbulence, the theoretical relationships are derived
which allow to determine the turbulent diffusion tensor as a function of the vertical coordinate
measured in the units of the local Obukhov length scale. The obtained relations are potentially
useful in modelling applications of particle dispersion in the atmospheric boundary-layer turbulence
and free atmosphere turbulence.

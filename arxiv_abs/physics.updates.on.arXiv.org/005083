Multi-contrast images are commonly acquired together to maximize complementary diagnostic information,
albeit at the expense of longer scan times. A time-efficient strategy to acquire high-quality multi-contrast
images is to accelerate individual sequences and then reconstruct undersampled data with joint
regularization terms that leverage common information across contrasts. However, these terms
can cause features that are unique to a subset of contrasts to leak into the other contrasts. Such
leakage-of-features may appear as artificial tissues, thereby misleading diagnosis. The goal
of this study is to develop a compressive sensing method for multi-channel multi-contrast magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) that optimally utilizes shared information while preventing feature
leakage. Joint regularization terms group sparsity and colour total variation are used to exploit
common features across images while individual sparsity and total variation are also used to prevent
leakage of distinct features across contrasts. The multi-channel multi-contrast reconstruction
problem is solved via a fast algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. The
proposed method is compared against using only individual and only joint regularization terms
in reconstruction. Comparisons were performed on single-channel simulated and multi-channel
in-vivo datasets in terms of reconstruction quality and neuroradiologist reader scores. The proposed
method demonstrates rapid convergence and improved image quality for both simulated and in-vivo
datasets. Furthermore, while reconstructions that solely use joint regularization terms are
prone to leakage-of-features, the proposed method reliably avoids leakage via simultaneous use
of joint and individual terms, thereby holding great promise for clinical use.

Polaritonic chemistry has become a rapidly developing field within the last few years. A multitude
of experimental observations suggest that chemical properties can be fundamentally altered and
novel physical states appear when matter is strongly coupled to resonant cavity modes, i.e. when
hybrid light-matter states emerge. Up until now, theoretical approaches to explain and predict
these observations were either limited to phenomenological quantum optical models, suited to
describe collective polaritonic effects, or alternatively to ab initio approaches for small system
sizes. The later methods were particularly controversial since collective effects could not be
explicitly included due to the intrinsically low particle numbers, which are computationally
accessible. Here, we demonstrate for a nitrogen dimer chain of variable size that any impurity present
in a collectively coupled chemical ensemble (e.g. temperature fluctuations or reaction process)
induces local modifications in the polaritonic system. From this we deduce that a novel dark state
is formed, whose local chemical properties are modified considerably at the impurity due to the
collectively coupled environment. Our simulations unify theoretical predictions from quantum
optical models (e.g. formation of collective dark states and different polaritonic branches)
with the single molecule quantum chemical perspective, which relies on the (quantized) redistribution
of local charges. Moreover, our findings suggest that the recently developed QEDFT method is suitable
to access these locally scaling polaritonic effects and it is a useful tool to better understand
recent experimental results and to even design novel experimental approaches. All of which paves
the way for many novel discoveries and applications in polaritonic chemistry.

For crystalline materials with long-range orders, the phonon modes involved in the phonon-assisted
radiation process are generally involving one or several phonons with specific vibration frequencies
1-4. In some glassy material, the phonon modes broaden in a short range 5-7. However, the locally
distinct chemical environments or mass disorder in high-entropy systems can induce an anharmonic
phonon-phonon coupling and composition disorder, which leads to significant phonon broadening
8,9.The terminology of high-entropy comes from the high configuration entropy larger than 1.5R
(R is the gas constant), which results from randomly distributed multiple nearly equal components
in a crystal lattice 10,11. Inspired by the high-entropy strategy, we deployed a high-entropy glass
system (HEGS) doped with neodymium ions, which exhibits a complex structure with tetrahedral voids
filled by different ions, including, Li+, Zn2+, Si4+, P5+, S6+, etc. Phonon spectral broadening
up to thousands of wavenumbers in the HEGS allows strong wide-band absorption in both the near-infrared
and mid-infrared ranges and assists the system radiation, i.e., broadened phonon-assisted wide-band
radiation (BPAWR). The subsequent low-threshold self-absorption coherence modulation (SACM)
was also observed in the HEGS, modulated by changing excitation wavelengths, sample size, and doping
concentrations. The time delay of the BPAWR signal is up to 1.66 ns relative to the zero-delay signal,
while the time delay of the Raman process is typically in the order of fs to ps, rarely up to 10 ps 12-15.The
BPAWR-SACM can be applied to realize signal amplification of the centered non-absorption band
when dual-wavelength lasers pump the HEGS sample, and signal amplification can be up to 26.02 dB.
The spectral characteristics of the BPAWR and the dynamics of the energy distribution of the excited
species are investigated in detail.

Free energies govern the behavior of soft and liquid matter, and improved predictions could have
a large impact on the development of drugs, electrolytes and homogeneous catalysts. Unfortunately,
it is challenging to devise an accurate description of effects governing solvation such as hydrogen-bonding,
van der Waals interactions, or entropy and conformational sampling. We present a machine learning
approach for free energies based on a representation that employs computationally efficient Boltzmann
averages for an approximated sampling of configurational space. Using the FreeSolv database,
our out-of-sample prediction errors of experimental hydration free energies decay systematically
with training set size, and experimental accuracy is reached after training on 80\% (490 molecules).
Corresponding model errors are on par or better than state-of-the art, physics based, legacy approaches.
To generate the input representation of a new query compound, the model requires approximate and
short molecular dynamics runs. We showcase the usefulness of this method through analysis of predicted
solvation free energies for 116k organic molecules (all force-field compatible molecules in QM9
database) identifying the most and least solvated systems, and rediscovering quasi-linear structure
property relationships in terms of hydrogen-bond donors, number of NH or OH groups, oxygen-content
in hydrocarbons, and number of heavy atoms. We observe that the model's accuracy is maximal when
the temperature used for the molecular dynamics simulation to generate averaged input representation
samples in training is the same as for the query compounds. Furthermore, the model's error converges
w.r.t. sampling time for both training and testing.

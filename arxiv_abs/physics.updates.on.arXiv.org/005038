JUNO is a multi-purpose neutrino experiment currently under construction in Jiangmen, China.
It is primary aiming to determine the neutrino mass ordering. Moreover, its 20\,kt target mass makes
it an ideal detector to study neutrinos from various sources, including nuclear reactors, the Earth
and its atmosphere, the Sun, and even supernovae. Due to the small cross section of neutrino interactions,
the event rate of neutrino experiments is limited. In order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio,
it is extremely important to control the background levels. In this paper we discuss the potential
of particle identification in JUNO, its underlying principles and possible areas of application
in the experiment. While the presented concepts can be transferred to any large liquid scintillator
detector, our methods are evaluated specifically for JUNO and the results are mainly driven by its
high optical photon yield of 1,200 photo electrons per MeV of deposited energy. In order to investigate
the potential of event discrimination, several event pairings are analysed, i.e. $\alpha/\beta$,
$p/\beta$, $e^+/e^-$, and $e^-/\gamma$. We compare the discrimination performance of advanced
analytical techniques based on neural networks and on the topological event reconstruction keeping
the standard Gatti filter as a reference. We use the Monte Carlo samples generated in the physically
motivated energy intervals. We study the dependence of our cuts on energy, radial position, PMT
time resolution, and dark noise. The results show an excellent performance for $\alpha/\beta$
and $p/\beta$ with the Gatti method and the neural network. Furthermore, $e^+/e^-$ and $e^-/\gamma$
can partly be distinguished by means of neural network and topological reconstruction on a statistical
basis. Especially in the latter case, the topological method proved very successful.

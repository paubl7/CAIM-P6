Wake redirection is a promising approach designed to mitigate turbine-wake interactions which
have a negative impact on the performance and lifetime of wind farms. It has recently been found that
substantial power gains can be obtained by tilting the rotors of spanwise-periodic wind-turbine
arrays. Rotor tilt is associated to the generation of coherent streamwise vortices which deflect
wakes towards the ground and, by exploiting the vertical wind shear, replace them with higher-momentum
fluid (high-speed streaks). The objective of this work is to evaluate power gains that can be obtained
by tilting rotors in spanwise-periodic wind-turbine arrays immersed in the atmospheric boundary
layer and, in particular, to analyze the influence of the rotor size on power gains in the case where
the turbines emerge from the atmospheric surface layer. We show that, for the case of wind-aligned
arrays, large power gains can be obtained for positive tilt angles of the order of 30{\deg}. Power
gains are substantially enhanced by operating tilted-rotor turbines at thrust coefficients higher
than in the reference configuration. These power gains initially increase with the rotor size reaching
a maximum for rotor diameters of the order of five boundary layer momentum thicknesses (for the considered
cases) and decrease for larger sizes.Maximum power gains are obtained for wind-turbine spanwise
spacings which are very similar to those of large-scale and very large scale streaky motions which
are naturally amplified in turbulent boundary layers. These results are all congruent with the
findings of previous investigations of passive control of canonical boundary layers for drag-reduction
applications where high-speed streaks replaced wakes of spanwise-periodic rows of wall-mounted
roughness elements.

Allostery is described as action at a distance. The end result of a stimulus may be mediated through
a dramatic conformational change or subtle global changes in the protein. A perspective based on
side-chain networks can provide valuable insights into the differences in global connectivity
features between various dynamical states of a protein. This is especially important to capture
subtle conformational changes. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we focus on characterizing the
global features of SARS-Cov2 (COVID-19) spike glycoprotein. Our objective is to review and apply
our network approaches to gain insights into a key viral protein at the structural level. We employ
dynamical side-chain network concepts on COVID-19 spike glycoprotein, which is crucial for viral
entry into human cells. As expected, there are considerable similarities of network metrics between
the partially open and the closed states of the trimeric SARS-CoV2 spike protein. However, there
are also significant differences seen at the domain-domain interfaces within a chain and across
the trimeric interface. We discuss these differences in terms of the structural-functional aspects
of the spike protein. Our comprehensive presentation and application of the side chain network
approach demonstrates its worth in the case of the spike protein. The analyses of the network parameters
show that the residues at the receptor binding domain and at the cell fusion level do not act locally
but are supported by extensive global side-chain networks. Sequence comparison with SARS-Cov1
shows that the residue level network metrics such as hubs, cliques/communities are mostly conserved
in the two proteins. Our analysis reflects the paramount importance of network features, implying
that computational drug design strategies stand to greatly benefit by exploiting them.

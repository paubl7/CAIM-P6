To understand the creation of electromagnetic energy (or a photonic degree of freedom) from an external
energy source, an electromotive force must be generated, capable of separating positive and negative
charges. The separation of charges (free or bound) may be modelled as a permanent polarization,
which has a non-zero vector curl, created by an external force per unit charge, sometimes referred
as an impressed electric field. The resulting system forms a physical dipole in the static case,
or a Hertzian dipole in the time dependent case. This system is the electrical dual of the magnetic
solenoid described by a magnetic vector potential and excited by an electrical current. Correspondingly,
the creation of an electric dipole, from the forceful separation of positive and negative charge,
may be described by an electric flux density, which exhibits an electric vector potential and a magnetic
current boundary source, within the frame work of two-potential theory without the need for the
existence of the magnetic monopole. From this result we derive the Dual electric Aharanov-Bohm
(DAB) topological phase and make the conjecture that it should be equivalent to the geometric phase
that is described in modern electric polarization theory, which also describes the nature of the
permanent polarization of a Ferroelectric. This work gives a formal meaning to the electric vector
potential that defines the DAB geometric phase, and determines that a permanent polarization has
both a scalar and vector potential component. Furthermore, we show that Faraday's and Ampere's
law may be derived from the time rate of change of the Aharanov-Bohm phase and the DAB phase respectively,
independent of the electromagnetic gauge.

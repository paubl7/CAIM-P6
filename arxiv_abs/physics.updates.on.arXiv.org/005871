There has been increasing experimental evidence of non-affine elastic deformation mechanisms
in biological soft tissues. These observations call for novel constitutive models which are able
to describe the dominant underlying micro-structural kinematics aspects, in particular relative
motion characteristics of different phases. This paper proposes a flexible and modular framework
based on a micromorphic continuum encompassing matrix and fiber phases. It features in addition
to the displacement field so-called director fields which can independently deform and intrinsically
carry orientational information. Accordingly, the fibrous constituents can be naturally associated
with the micromorphic directors and their non-affine motion within the bulk material can be efficiently
captured. Furthermore, constitutive relations can be formulated based on kinematics quantities
specifically linked to the material response of the matrix, the fibres and their mutual interactions.
Associated stress quantities are naturally derived from a micromorphic variational principle
featuring dedicated governing equations for displacement and director fields. This aspect of
the framework is crucial for the truly non-affine elastic deformation description. In contrast
to conventional micromorphic approaches, any non-local higher-order material behaviour is excluded,
thus significantly reducing the number of material parameters to a range typically found in related
classical approaches. In the context of biological soft tissue modeling, the potential and applicability
of the formulation is studied for a number of academic examples featuring anisotropic fiber-reinforced
composite material composition to elucidate the micromorphic material response as compared with
the one obtained using a classical continuum mechanics approach.

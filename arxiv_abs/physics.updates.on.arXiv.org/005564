X-ray as well as electron diffraction are powerful tools for structure determination of molecules.
Electron diffraction methods yield \r{A}ngstrom-resolution even when applied to large systems
or systems involving weak scatterers such as hydrogen atoms. For cases in which molecular crystals
cannot be obtained or the interaction-free molecular structure is to be addressed, corresponding
electron scattering approaches on gas-phase molecules exist. Such studies on randomly oriented
molecules, however, can only provide information on interatomic distances, which is challenging
to analyse in case of overlapping distance parameters and they do not reveal the handedness of chiral
systems8. Here, we present a novel scheme to obtain information on the structure, handedness and
even detailed geometrical features of single molecules in the gas phase. Using a loop-like analysis
scheme employing input from ab initio computations on the photoionization process, we are able
to deduce the three dimensional molecular structure with sensitivity to the position individual
atoms, as e.g. protons. To achieve this, we measure the molecular frame diffraction pattern of core-shell
photoelectrons in combination with only two ionic fragments from a molecular Coulomb explosion.
Our approach is expected to be suitable for larger molecules, as well, since typical size limitations
regarding the structure determination by pure Coulomb explosion imaging are overcome by measuring
in addition the photoelectron in coincidence with the ions. As the photoelectron interference
pattern captures the molecular structure at the instant of ionization, we anticipate our approach
to allow for tracking changes in the molecular structure on a femtosecond time scale by applying
a pump-probe scheme in the future.

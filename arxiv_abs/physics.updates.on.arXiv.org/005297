Isostasy explains why observed gravity anomalies are generally much weaker than what is expected
from topography alone, and why planetary crusts can support high topography without breaking up.
Classical isostasy, however, neglects internal stresses and geoid contributions to topographical
support, and yields ambiguous predictions of geoid anomalies. Isostasy should instead be defined
either by minimizing deviatoric elastic stresses within the elastic shell, or by studying the dynamic
response of the body in the long-time limit. I implement here the first option by formulating Airy
isostatic equilibrium as the response of an elastic shell to surface and internal loads. Isostatic
ratios are defined in terms of deviatoric Love numbers which quantify deviations with respect to
a fluid state. The Love number approach separates the physics of isostasy from the technicalities
of elastic-gravitational spherical deformations, and provides flexibility in the choice of the
interior structure. Since elastic isostasy is invariant under a global rescaling of the shell shear
modulus, it can be defined in the fluid shell limit, which reveals a deep connection with viscous
isostasy. If the shell is homogeneous, minimum stress isostasy is dual to a variant of elastic isostasy
called zero deflection isostasy, which is less physical but simpler to compute. Each isostatic
model is combined with general boundary conditions applied at the surface and bottom of the shell,
resulting in one-parameter isostatic families. At long wavelength, the influence of boundary
conditions disappears as all isostatic families members yield the same isostatic ratios. At short
wavelength, topography is supported by shallow stresses so that Airy isostasy becomes similar
to either pure top or bottom loading. The isostatic ratios of incompressible bodies with three homogeneous
layers are implemented in freely available software.

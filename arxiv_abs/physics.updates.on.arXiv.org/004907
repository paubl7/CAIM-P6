In this paper, we present two deep learning-based hybrid data-driven reduced order models for the
prediction of unsteady fluid flows. The first model projects the high-fidelity time series data
from a finite element Navier-Stokes solver to a low-dimensional subspace via proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD). The time-dependent coefficients in the POD subspace are propagated by the
recurrent net (closed-loop encoder-decoder updates) and mapped to a high-dimensional state via
the mean flow field and POD basis vectors. This model is referred as POD-RNN. The second model, referred
to as convolution recurrent autoencoder network (CRAN), employs convolutional neural networks
(CNN) as layers of linear kernels with nonlinear activations, to extract low-dimensional features
from flow field snapshots. The flattened features are advanced using a recurrent (closed-loop
manner) net and up-sampled (transpose convoluted) gradually to high-dimensional snapshots.
Two benchmark problems of the flow past a cylinder and flow past a side-by-side cylinder are selected
as the test problems to assess the efficacy of these models. For the problem of flow past a single cylinder,
the performance of both the models is satisfactory, with CRAN being a bit overkill. However, it completely
outperforms the POD-RNN model for a more complicated problem of flow past side-by-side cylinders.
Owing to the scalability of CRAN, we briefly introduce an observer-corrector method for the calculation
of integrated pressure force coefficients on the fluid-solid boundary on a reference grid. This
reference grid, typically a structured and uniform grid, is used to interpolate scattered high-dimensional
field data as snapshot images. These input images are convenient in training CRAN. This motivates
us to further explore the application of CRAN models for the prediction of fluid flows.

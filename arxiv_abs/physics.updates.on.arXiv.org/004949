The magma ocean period was a critical phase determining how Earth atmosphere developed into habitability.
However there are major uncertainties in the role of key processes such as outgassing from the planetary
interior and escape of species to space that play a major role in determining the atmosphere of early
Earth. We investigate the influence of outgassing of various species and escape of H$_2$ for different
mantle redox states upon the composition and evolution of the atmosphere for the magma ocean period.
We include an important new atmosphere-interior coupling mechanism namely the redox evolution
of the mantle which strongly affects the outgassing of species. We simulate the volatile outgassing
and chemical speciation at the surface for various redox states of the mantle by employing a C-H-O
based chemical speciation model combined with an interior outgassing model. We then apply a line-by-line
radiative transfer model to study the remote appearance of the planet in terms of the infrared emission
and transmission. Finally, we use a parameterized diffusion-limited and XUV energy-driven atmospheric
escape model to calculate the loss of H$_2$ to space. We have simulated the thermal emission and transmission
spectra for reduced or oxidized atmospheres present during the magma ocean period of Earth. Reduced
or thin atmospheres consisting of H$_2$ in abundance emit more radiation to space and have larger
effective height as compared to oxidized or thick atmospheres which are abundant in H$_2$O and CO$_2$.
We obtain the outgassing rates of H2 from the mantle into the atmosphere to be a factor of ten times
larger than the rates of diffusion-limited escape to space. Our work presents useful insight into
the development of Earth atmosphere during the magma ocean period as well as input to guide future
studies discussing exoplanetary interior compositions.

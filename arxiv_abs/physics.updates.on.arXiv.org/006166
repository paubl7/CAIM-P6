This review article revisits and outlines the perfectly matched layer (PML) method and its various
formulations developed over the past 25 years for the numerical modeling and simulation of wave
propagation in unbounded media. Based on the concept of complex coordinate stretching, an efficient
mixed displacement-strain unsplit-field PML formulation for second-order (displacementbased)
linear elastodynamic equations is then proposed for simulating the propagation and absorption
of elastic waves in unbounded (infinite or semi-infinite) domains. Both time-harmonic (frequency-domain)
and time-dependent (timedomain) PML formulations are derived for two-and three-dimensional
linear elastodynamic problems. Through the introduction of only a few additional variables governed
by low-order auxiliary differential equations, the resulting mixed timedomain PML formulation
is second-order in time, thereby allowing the use of standard time integration schemes commonly
employed in computational structural dynamics and thus facilitating the incorporation into existing
displacementbased finite element codes. For computational efficiency, the proposed timedomain
PML formulation is implemented using a hybrid approach that couples a mixed (displacement-strain)
formulation for the PML region with a classical (displacement-based) formulation for the physical
domain of interest, using a standard Galerkin finite element method (FEM) for spatial discretization
and a Newmark time scheme coupled with a finite difference (Crank-Nicolson) time scheme for time
sampling. Numerical experiments show the performances of the PML method in terms of accuracy, efficiency
and stability for two-dimensional linear elastodynamic problems in single-and multi-layer isotropic
homogeneous elastic media.

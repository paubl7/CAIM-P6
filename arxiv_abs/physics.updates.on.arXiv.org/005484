Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI, also known as concussion) caused by the head impact is a crucial
global public health problem, but the physics of mTBI is still unclear. During the impact, the rapid
movement of the head injures the brain, so researchers have been endeavoring to investigate the
relationship between head kinematic parameters (e.g., linear acceleration, angular velocity,
angular acceleration) and brain strain, which is associated with the injury of the brain tissue.
Although previous studies have shown that linear acceleration had a limited contribution to brain
strain, whether angular velocity or angular acceleration causes brain strain is still unclear
because of their interdependency (acceleration being the velocity time-derivative). By reframing
the problem through the lens of inertial forces, we propose to use the skull frame of reference instead
of the ground frame of reference to describe brain deformation during head impact. Based on the rigid-body
rotation of the brain, we present a theoretical framework of mechanical analysis about how the inertial
forces cause brain strain. In this way, we theoretically show that angular acceleration determines
brain strain, and we validate this by numerical simulations using a finite element head model. We
also provide an explanation of why previous studies based on peak values found the opposite: that
angular velocity determined brain strain in certain situations. Furthermore, we use the same framework
to show that linear acceleration causes brain strain in a different mechanism from angular acceleration.
However, because of the brain's different resistances to compressing and shearing, the brain strain
caused by linear acceleration is small compared with angular acceleration.

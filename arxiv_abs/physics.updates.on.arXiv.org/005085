The Unitary Group adapted State-Specific Multi-Reference Perturbation Theory (UGA-SSMRPT)
developed by Mukherjee et al has successfully realized the goal of studying bond dissociation in
a numerically stable, spin-preserving and size-consistent manner. The theory belongs to a suite
of Unitary Group Adapted SS-MR theories developed by the group, starting with coupled cluster (CC)
and then it's second order PT (UGA-SSMRPT2) which possesses all of the desirable features of generating
a manifold of PES of same or different spatial symmetries. However, they lack invariance with respect
to transformation of orbitals in the active space. UGA-SSMRPT2 displays remarkable predictability,
yet being computationally much cheaper than it's CC counterpart. It is not immediately obvious
how a state-specific theory, generating successively higher-lying PES one at a time, would retain
sufficiently accurate information of other close lying PES of the same symmetry to demonstrate
interlacing of the PES and also of the possible strong/weak avoided crossings. In state-specific
formalism, since each state is an eigenstate of its own effective operator, to include the information
of the other states require the theory to be sufficiently accurate. We present here the results for
a variety of electronic states of a set of molecules in their various spin multiplicities which display
the striking accuracy of UGA-SSMRPT2 for all the states studied by us. Accuracy of our results has
been benchmarked against IC-MRCISD+Q. This bolsters our belief in the intrinsic accuracy of the
formalism in sensing the interactions of the PES of same symmetry. The validation of the sufficiency
we had used in our theory, which had helped us bypass the projection of our equations by strictly orthogonal
excited functions, has also been demonstrated.

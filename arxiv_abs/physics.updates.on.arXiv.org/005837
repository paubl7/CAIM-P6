Soot formation in Delft flame III, a pilot stabilized turbulent diffusion flame burning natural
gas/air, is investigated using ANSYS FLUENT by considering two different approaches for soot inception.
In the first approach soot inception is based on the formation rate of acetylene, while the second
approach considers the formation rate of two and three-ringed aromatics to describe the soot inception
[1]. Transport equations are solved for soot mass fraction and radical nuclei concentration to
describe inception, coagulation, surface growth, and oxidation processes. The turbulent-chemistry
interactions and soot precursors are described by the steady laminar flamelet model (SLFM). Two
chemical mechanisms GRI 3.0 [2] and POLIMI [3] are used to represent the effect of species concentration
on soot formation. The radiative properties of the medium are included based on the non-gray modeling
approach by considering four factious gases; the weighted sum of gray gas (WSGGM) approach is used
to model the absorption coefficient. The effect of soot on radiative transfer is modeled in terms
of effective absorption coefficient of the medium. A beta probability density function (\b{eta}-PDF)
in terms of normalized temperature is used to describe the effect of turbulence on soot formation.
The results clearly elucidate the strong effect of radiation and species concentration on soot
volume fraction predictions. Due to increase in radiative heat loss with soot, flame temperature
decreases slightly. The inclusion of ethylene has less synergic effect than that of both benzene
and ethylene. Both cases have less impact on the nucleation of soot. The increase in soot volume fraction
with soot-turbulence interaction is in consistence with the DNS predictions.

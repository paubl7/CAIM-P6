Uncertainty quantification of groundwater (GW) aquifer parameters is critical for efficient
management and sustainable extraction of GW resources. These uncertainties are introduced by
the data, model, and prior information on the parameters. Here we develop a Bayesian inversion framework
that uses Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) surface deformation data to infer
the laterally heterogeneous permeability of a transient linear poroelastic model of a confined
GW aquifer. The Bayesian solution of this inverse problem takes the form of a posterior probability
density of the permeability. Exploring this posterior using classical Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods is computationally prohibitive due to the large dimension of the discretized permeability
field and the expense of solving the poroelastic forward problem. However, in many partial differential
equation (PDE)-based Bayesian inversion problems, the data are only informative in a few directions
in parameter space. For the poroelasticity problem, we prove this property theoretically for a
one-dimensional problem and demonstrate it numerically for a three-dimensional aquifer model.
We design a generalized preconditioned Crank--Nicolson (gpCN) MCMC method that exploits this
intrinsic low dimensionality by using a low-rank based Laplace approximation of the posterior
as a proposal, which we build scalably. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated through
a real GW aquifer test in Nevada. The inherently two dimensional nature of InSAR surface deformation
data informs a sufficient number of modes of the permeability field to allow detection of major structures
within the aquifer, significantly reducing the uncertainty in the pressure and the displacement
quantities of interest.

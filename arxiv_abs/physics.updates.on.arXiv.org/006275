We discuss the design and software implementation of a nuclear data evaluation pipeline applied
for a fully reproducible evaluation of neutron-induced cross sections of $^{56}$Fe above the resolved
resonance region using the nuclear model code TALYS combined with relevant experimental data.
The emphasis is on the mathematical and technical aspects of the pipeline and not on the evaluation
of $^{56}$Fe, which is tentative. The mathematical building blocks combined and employed in the
pipeline are discussed in detail. A unified representation of experimental data, systematic and
statistical errors, model parameters and defects enables the application of the Generalized Least
Squares (GLS) and its natural extension, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, on a large collection
of experimental data. The LM algorithm tailored to nuclear data evaluation accounts for the exact
non-linear physics model to determine best estimates of nuclear quantities. Associated uncertainty
information is derived from a Taylor expansion at the maximum of the posterior distribution. We
also discuss the pipeline in terms of its IT (=information technology) building blocks, such as
those to efficiently manage and retrieve experimental data of the EXFOR library and to distribute
computations on a scientific cluster. Relying on the mathematical and IT building blocks, we elaborate
on the sequence of steps in the pipeline to perform the evaluation, such as the retrieval of experimental
data, the correction of experimental uncertainties using marginal likelihood optimization (MLO)
and after a screening of thousand TALYS parameters -- including Gaussian process priors on energy
dependent parameters -- the fitting of about 150 parameters using the LM algorithm. The code of the
pipeline including a manual and a Dockerfile for a simplified installation is available at www.nucleardata.com.

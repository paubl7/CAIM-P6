The objectives were to develop a novel three-dimensional technology for imaging naturally occurring
shear wave (SW) propagation, demonstrate feasibility on human volunteers and quantify SW velocity
in different propagation directions. Imaging of natural SWs generated by valve closures has emerged
to obtain a direct measurement of cardiac stiffness. Recently, natural SW velocity was assessed
in two dimensions on parasternal long axis view under the assumption of a propagation direction
along the septum. However, in this approach the source localization and the complex three-dimensional
propagation wave path was neglected making the speed estimation unreliable. High volume rate transthoracic
acquisitions of the human left ventricle (1100 volume/s) was performed with a 4D ultrafast echocardiographic
scanner. Four-dimensional tissue velocity cineloops enabled visualization of aortic and mitral
valve closure waves. Energy and time of flight mapping allowed propagation path visualization
and source localization, respectively. Velocities were quantified along different directions.
Aortic and mitral valve closure SW velocities were assessed for the three volunteers with low standard
deviation. Anisotropic propagation was also found suggesting the necessity of using a three-dimensional
imaging approach. Different velocities were estimated for the three directions for the aortic
(3.4$\pm$0.1 m/s, 3.5$\pm$0.3 m/s, 5.4$\pm$0.7 m/s) and the mitral (2.8$\pm$0.5 m/s, 2.9$\pm$0.3
m/s, 4.6$\pm$0.7 m/s) valve SWs. 4D ultrafast ultrasound alleviates the limitations of 2D ultrafast
ultrasound for cardiac SW imaging based on natural SW propagations and enables a comprehensive
measurement of cardiac stiffness. This technique could provide stiffness mapping of the left ventricle.

Absolute gravimeters (AG) are used in geodesy, geophysics, and physics for a wide spectrum of applications.
Stable gravimetric measurements over timescales from several days to decades are required to provide
relevant insight into geophysical processes. Users of AGs participate in comparisons with a metrological
reference in order to monitor the temporal stability of the instruments and determine the bias to
that reference. However, since no measurement standard of higher-order accuracy currently exists,
users of AGs participate in key comparisons led by the CIPM. These comparisons provide the reference
values of highest accuracy compared to the calibration against a single AG. The construction of
stationary, large scale atom interferometers paves the way towards a new measurement standard
in absolute gravimetry used as a reference with a potential stability up to 1 nm/s$^2$ at 1 s integration
time. At the Leibniz University Hannover, we are currently building such a very long baseline atom
interferometer with a 10 m long interaction zone. The knowledge of local gravity and its gradient
along and around the baseline is required to establish the instrument's uncertainty budget and
enable transfers of gravimetric measurements to nearby devices for comparison and calibration
purposes. We therefore established a control network for relative gravimeters and repeatedly
measured its connections during the construction of the atom interferometer. We additionally
developed a 3D model of the host building to investigate the self-attraction effect and studied
the impact of mass changes due to groundwater hydrology on the gravity field around the reference
instrument. The gravitational effect from the building 3D model is in excellent agreement with
the latest gravimetric measurement campaign which opens the possibility to transfer gravity values
with an uncertainty below the 10 nm/s$^2$ level.

Paleo-detectors are a proposed experimental technique to search for dark matter (DM). In lieu of
the conventional approach of operating a tonne-scale real-time detector to search for DM-induced
nuclear recoils, paleo-detectors take advantage of small samples of naturally occurring rocks
on Earth that have been deep underground ($\gtrsim 5$ km), accumulating nuclear damage tracks from
recoiling nuclei for $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Gyr. Modern microscopy techniques promise the capability
to read out nuclear damage tracks with nanometer resolution in macroscopic samples. Thanks to their
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ Gyr integration times, paleo-detectors could constitute nuclear recoil detectors
with keV recoil energy thresholds and 100 kilotonne-yr exposures. This combination would allow
paleo-detectors to probe DM-nucleon cross sections orders of magnitude below existing upper limits
from conventional direct detection experiments. In this article, we use improved background modeling
and a new spectral analysis technique to update the sensitivity forecast for paleo-detectors.
We demonstrate the robustness of the sensitivity forecast to the (lack of) ancillary measurements
of the age of the samples and the parameters controlling the backgrounds, systematic mismodeling
of the spectral shape of the backgrounds, and the radiopurity of the mineral samples. Specifically,
we demonstrate that even if the uranium concentration in paleo-detector samples is $10^{-8}$ (per
weight), many orders of magnitude larger than what we expect in the most radiopure samples obtained
from ultra basic rock or marine evaporite deposits, paleo-detectors could still probe DM-nucleon
cross sections below current limits. For DM masses $\lesssim 10$ GeV/$c^2$, the sensitivity of
paleo-detectors could still reach down all the way to the conventional neutrino floor in a Xe-based
direct detection experiment.

The quest for reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in transport has been a powerful driving
force for scientific research into methods that might underpin drag-reducing technologies for
a variety of vehicular transport on roads, by rail, in the air, and on or in the water. In civil aviation,
skin-friction drag accounts for around 50% of the total drag in cruise conditions, thus being a preferential
target for research. With laminar conditions excluded, skin friction is intimately linked to the
turbulence physics in the fluid layer closest to the skin. Thus, research into drag reduction has
focused on methods to depress the turbulence activity near the surface. The most effective method
of doing so is to subject the drag-producing flow in the near-wall layer to an unsteady and/or spatially
varying cross-flow component, either by the action of transverse wall oscillations, by embedding
rotating discs into the surface or by plasma-producing electrodes that accelerate the near-wall
fluid in the transverse direction. In ideal conditions, drag-reduction margins of order of 50%
can be achieved. The present article provides a review of research into the response of turbulent
near-wall layers to the imposition of unsteady and wavy transverse motion, encompassing experiments,
simulation, analysis and modelling. It covers issues such as the drag-reduction margin in a variety
of actuation scenarios, the underlying physical phenomena that contribute to the interpretation
of the origin of the drag reduction, the dependence of the drag reduction on the Reynolds number,
passive control methods that are inspired by active control, and a forward look towards possible
future research and practical realizations. The authors hope that this review, by far the most extensive
of its kind for this subject, will be judged as a useful foundation for future research targeting

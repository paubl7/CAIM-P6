We explore the potential of feed-forward deep neural networks (DNNs) for emulating cloud superparameterization
in realistic geography, using offline fits to data from the Super Parameterized Community Atmospheric
Model. To identify the network architecture of greatest skill, we formally optimize hyperparameters
using ~250 trials. Our DNN explains over 70 percent of the temporal variance at the 15-minute sampling
scale throughout the mid-to-upper troposphere. Autocorrelation timescale analysis compared
against DNN skill suggests the less good fit in the tropical, marine boundary layer is driven by neural
network difficulty emulating fast, stochastic signals in convection. However, spectral analysis
in the temporal domain indicates skillful emulation of signals on diurnal to synoptic scales. A
close look at the diurnal cycle reveals correct emulation of land-sea contrasts and vertical structure
in the heating and moistening fields, but some distortion of precipitation. Sensitivity tests
targeting precipitation skill reveal complementary effects of adding positive constraints vs.
hyperparameter tuning, motivating the use of both in the future. A first attempt to force an offline
land model with DNN emulated atmospheric fields produces reassuring results further supporting
neural network emulation viability in real-geography settings. Overall, the fit skill is competitive
with recent attempts by sophisticated Residual and Convolutional Neural Network architectures
trained on added information, including memory of past states. Our results confirm the parameterizability
of superparameterized convection with continents through machine learning and we highlight advantages
of casting this problem locally in space and time for accurate emulation and hopefully quick implementation
of hybrid climate models.

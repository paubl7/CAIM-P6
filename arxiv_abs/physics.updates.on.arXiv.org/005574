When building a global brand of any kind -- a political actor, clothing style, or belief system --
developing widespread awareness is a primary goal. Short of knowing any of the stories or products
of a brand, being talked about in whatever fashion -- raw fame -- is, as Oscar Wilde would have it, better
than not being talked about at all. Here, we measure, examine, and contrast the day-to-day raw fame
dynamics on Twitter for US Presidents and major US Presidential candidates from 2008 to 2020: Barack
Obama, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden. We assign ``lexical
fame'' to be the number and (Zipfian) rank of the (lowercased) mentions made for each individual
across all languages. We show that all five political figures have at some point reached extraordinary
volume levels of what we define to be ``lexical ultrafame'': An overall rank of approximately 300
or less which is largely the realm of function words and demarcated by the highly stable rank of `god'.
By this measure, `trump' has become enduringly ultrafamous, from the 2016 election on. We use typical
ranks for country names and function words as standards to improve perception of scale. We quantify
relative fame rates and find that in the eight weeks leading up the 2008 and 2012 elections, `obama'
held a 1000:757 volume ratio over `mccain' and 1000:892 over `romney', well short of the 1000:544
and 1000:504 volumes favoring `trump' over `hillary' and `biden' in the 8 weeks leading up to the
2016 and 2020 elections. Finally, we track how only one other entity has more sustained ultrafame
than `trump' on Twitter: The K-pop (Korean pop) band BTS. We chart the dramatic rise of BTS, finding
their Twitter handle `@bts\_twt' has been able to compete with `a' and `the'. Our findings for BTS
more generally point to K-pop's growing economic, social, and political power.

Noise pollution caused by inflow turbulence is a major problem in many applications, such as propellers
and fans. Leading edge noise models, e.g., Amiet's model, are widely applied to predict the noise
produced by these applications. This noise prediction model relies on the accuracy of the turbulence
spectrum, which is usually assumed to be the von K\'arm\'an energy spectrum for isotropic turbulence.
However, the von K\'arm\'an spectrum does not model accurately the dissipation range of the turbulent
energy, resulting in incorrect far-field noise predictions for the high-frequency range. An exponential
correction can be applied to the spectrum to model the dissipation range. This correction depends
on the dissipation frequency, which is the frequency where the energy spectrum changes from a dependence
of $k^{-5/3}$ to an exponential decay. This study experimentally investigates nearly isotropic
inflow turbulence and determines the flow field characteristics that affect the dissipation frequency
in order to model this frequency and the dissipation range. Experiments have been conducted with
two passive grids and hot-wire anemometry in the Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel of the University of Twente.
The turbulence uniformity in the test section and the turbulence development in the streamwise
direction were analyzed, showing that the grid generated turbulence was mostly uniform and nearly
isotropic. The dissipation frequency was observed to depend on the turbulence intensity, the free-stream
velocity, and the turbulence length scale. An expression to compute this frequency is proposed,
as well as a formula to predict the dissipation range. The predicted leading edge noise is affected
by the dissipation range modelling in the high-frequency range, presenting a decrease in level
up to 17 dB for the highest frequencies.

We propose a new class of wicks, consisting of closely packed circular rods, whose evaporative capacities
have been measured at different heat loads ranging between 0.05W/cm^2 and 8W/cm^2. The experiments
were performed with two different liquids, water and highly volatile pentane, in a specially designed
setup to understand transient and steady state cooling characteristics of the proposed wicks.
Heat interception and vapour release occur on the same side in these experiments. These wicks released
~50% of the supplied heat load as the latent heat; this value remained nearly constant between the
explored heat loads. These wicks have the unique characteristic of potentially very high and rapid
capillary rise induced by near-zero radii (NZR) of contacts formed between the rods in contact;
liquid region reaching the end in NZR has been called corner meniscus. While the bulk liquid (present
between three rods) may recede, depending on the heat load, the corner meniscus remains pinned;
this unique feature thus leads to sustained high evaporation rate requirements. This remarkable
characteristic seems advantageous compared to a regular wick, whose cooling performance depends
on the heat loads. We also performed 3-D unsteady state numerical simulations to understand the
effect of rod diameter and materials' thermal conductivity on the overall wick's performance.
Steady state temperature value was in fairly good agreement with the ones measured in experiments.
Based on the geometry of the corner film, fluid mechanics of liquid transport, and the heat transfer
aspects, we present a design of suitable wicks as per the requirement. These new configurations
can represent a separate class of wicks and may replace the regular wicks in current and futuristic
cooling devices.

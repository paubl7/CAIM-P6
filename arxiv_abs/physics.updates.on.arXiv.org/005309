The angular uncertainty principle (angular-UP) states the orbital angular momentum (OAM) is precisely
defined in an optical vortex with angular position (AP) ranging over 2{\pi} azimuthal coordinate
({\phi}). However, the pair of observable states is discretely selected and does not correspondent
to the pair of unselected linear momentum and position states for the lower bound. This discrete
selection is such that the pair of angular uncertainties is independent of n-fold symmetry. Herein,
we demonstrate the smaller difference between mean OAM and the product of azimuthal phase-gradient
(PG) and h/2{\pi}, the larger {\phi} range of one periodic helical wavefront in a set of numerous
singular light beams, each of which utilizes the superposition comprising two fractional OAM light
beams that have a difference of {\delta} in the azimuthal PG. This is a periodically angular UP (periodic-UP)
for any pair of unselected states of periodic OAM and AP by a constant product 0.187 h/2{\pi} on their
underlying uncertainties, or the pair of unlimited scale of periodic OAM and AP uncertainties.
This constant lower bound corresponds to the Robeson bound held by linear UP for the pair of unselected
observables; however, it is stronger by 2.67 times. We demonstrate a macroscopic example of the
periodic-UP by illustrating a physical interpretation of the image constructed by phase shift.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the pair of periodically angular uncertainties in this singular
light beam is compatible with the pair of angular uncertainties by dividing and multiplying a sub-n
periodic number, respectively. We demonstrate that both OAM and AP uncertainties are two monotonic
functions of {\delta} and two various distribution types of OAM spectrum and image intensity in
this singular light with identically equivalent PGs. We experimentally generate these singular
light beams.

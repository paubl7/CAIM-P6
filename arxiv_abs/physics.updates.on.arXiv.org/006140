The aim of this study is to analyze the stability of the Alfven eigenmodes (AE) in the Chinese First
Quasi-axisymmetric Stellarator (CFQS). The AE stability is calculated using the code FAR3d that
solves the reduced MHD equations to describe the linear evolution of the poloidal flux and the toroidal
component of the vorticity in a full 3D system, coupled with equations of density and parallel velocity
moment for the energetic particles (EP) species including the effect of the helical couplings and
acoustic modes. The Landau damping and resonant destabilization effects are added in the model
by a given closure relation. The simulation results indicate the destabilization of n = 1 to 4 AEs
by EP during the slowing down process, particularly n = 1 and n = 2 toroidal AEs (TAE), n = 3 elliptical
AE (EAE) and n = 4 non circular AE (NAE). If the resonance is caused by EPs with an energy above 17 keV
(weakly thermalized EP), n = 2 EAEs and n = 3 NAEs are unstable. On the other hand, EPs with an energy
below 17 keV (late thermalization stage) lead to the destabilization of n = 3 and n = 4 TAEs. The simulations
for an off-axis NBI injection indicate the further destabilization of n = 2 to 4 AEs although the growth
rate of the n = 1 AEs slightly decreases, so no clear optimization trend with respect to the NBI deposition
region is identified. In addition, n = 2, 4 helical AE (HAE) are unstable above an EP \b{eta} threshold.
Also, if the thermal \b{eta} of the simulation increases (higher thermal plasma density) the AE
stability of the plasma improves. The simulations including the effect of the finite Larmor radius
and electron-ion Landau damping show the stabilization of the n = 1 to 4 EAE/NAEs as well as a decrease
of the growth rate and frequency of the n = 1 to 4 BAE/TAEs.

To help resolve issues of non-realizability and restriction to homogeneity faced by analytical
theories of turbulence, we explore three-dimensional homogeneous shear turbulence of incompressible
Newtonian fluids via optimal control and convex optimization. The framework is composed of multi-point
spatial correlations of velocity and pressure fluctuations up to the degenerate fourth order,
their evolution equations and constraints. The integral of trace of the second order correlations
is argued as the objective functional to be maximized. The sources of the constraints are discussed
like the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the non-negativity of variance of products (NNVP). Two
models are defined: the second-order model uses the contracted and degenerate third order correlations
as control variables; the third-order model takes the degenerate fourth order correlations as
control variables. Both are second-order cone programs. Computation of large-scale and huge-scale
and link to big data are noted. The exponential growth rates of the asymptotic states are bounded
from above by zero. The steady state of the second-order model is solved. Three finite macro length
scales are predicted beyond which the two-point correlations are negligible. The predicted values
of the anisotropy tensor are consistent with experimental data qualitatively (concerning the
relative numerical order of the diagonal components), albeit with large quantitative differences
attributed to the non-enforceability of NNVP within the model. Compared with DNS data, the predicted
second order correlation functions contain flawed features of local minima too large in magnitude
or present spuriously. The third-order model is expected to improve predictions, owing to its ability
to include constraints from NNVP and its formulation in an enlarged control variable space. It is
yet open how to solve this huge-scale problem.

In magnetic confinement fusion research, the achievement of high plasma pressure is key to reaching
the goal of net energy production. The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model is used to self-consistently
calculate the effects the plasma pressure induces on the magnetic field used to confine the plasma.
Such MHD calculations serve as input for the assessment of a number of important physics questions.
The VMEC code is the most widely used to evaluate 3D ideal-MHD equilibria, as prominently present
in stellarators. However, considering the computational cost, it is rarely used in large-scale
or online applications. Access to fast MHD equilbria is a challenging problem in fusion research,
one which machine learning could effectively address. In this paper, we present artificial neural
network (NN) models able to quickly compute the equilibrium magnetic field of W7-X. Magnetic configurations
that extensively cover the device operational space, and plasma profiles with volume averaged
normalized plasma pressure $\langle \beta \rangle$ ($\beta$ = $\frac{2 \mu_0 p}{B^2}$) up to 5%
and non-zero net toroidal current are included in the data set. By using convolutional layers, the
spectral representation of the magnetic flux surfaces can be efficiently computed with a single
network. To discover better models, a Bayesian hyper-parameter search is carried out, and 3D convolutional
neural networks are found to outperform feed-forward fully-connected neural networks. The achieved
normalized root-mean-squared error ranges from 1% to 20% across the different scenarios. The model
inference time for a single equilibrium is on the order of milliseconds. Finally, this work shows
the feasibility of a fast NN drop-in surrogate model for VMEC, and it opens up new operational scenarios
where target applications could make use of magnetic equilibria at unprecedented scales.

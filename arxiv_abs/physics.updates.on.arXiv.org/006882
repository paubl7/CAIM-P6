Nanotechnology has been one of the fastest growing fields in the last three decades. Nanomaterials
(sized 1-100 nm) has a wide spectrum of potential applications in many fields, applied as coating
materials or in treatment and diagnosis. Nowadays, nanoparticles of both metallic and non-metallic
origin are under investigation and development for applications in various fields of biology/therapeutics.
Specifically, we show the correlations between the physicochemistry and biophysical specificity
of metal nanoparticles and their uptake, transport, and biodistribution in cells, at the molecular,
cellular, and whole organism level. Physiologically important metals are present in the human
body with a wide range of biological activities. Some of these metals are magnesium, chromium, manganese,
iron, cobalt, copper, zinc, selenium and molybdenum. Metals used in nanotechnology have to be biocompatible
with the human system in terms of absorption, assimilation, excretion, and side effects. These
metals are synthesized in the form of nanoparticles by different physical and chemical methods.
Nanotoxicological studies of metal nanoparticles are intended to determine whether and to what
extent their properties may pose a threat to the environment and to human beings. An overview of metal
and metal oxide nanoparticles, their applications, and the potential for human exposure is provided,
and it is integrated by a discussion of general principles of nanoparticle-induced toxicity and
methods for toxicity testing of nanomaterials. This review wants to focus on establishing metal
nanoparticles of physiological importance to be the best candidates for future nanotechnological
tools and medicines, owing to the acceptability and safety in the human body. This can only be successful
if these particles are synthesized with a better biocompatibility and low or no toxicity.

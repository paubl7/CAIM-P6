A fully nonlinear potential Numerical Wave Tank (NWT) is developed in two dimensions, using a combination
of the Harmonic Polynomial Cell (HPC) method for solving the Laplace problem on the wave potential
and the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) for capturing the free surface motion. This NWT can consider
fixed, submerged or wall-sided surface piercing, bodies. To compute the flow around the body and
associated pressure field, a novel multi overlapping grid method is implemented. Each grid having
its own free surface, a two-way communication is ensured between the problem in the body vicinity
and the larger scale wave propagation problem. Pressure field and nonlinear loads on the structure
are computed by solving a boundary value problem on the time derivative of the potential. The stability
and convergence properties of the solver are studied basing on extensive tests with standing waves
of large to extreme wave steepness, up to $H/\lambda=0.2$ ($H$ is the crest-to-trough wave height
and $\lambda$ the wavelength). Ranges of optimal time and spatial discretizations are determined
and high-order convergence properties are verified, first without using any filter. For cases
with either high level of nonlinearity or long simulation duration, the use of mild Savitzky-Golay
filters is shown to extend the range of applicability of the model. Then, the NWT is tested against
two wave flume experiments, analyzing forces on bodies in various wave conditions. First, nonlinear
components of the vertical force acting on a small horizontal circular cylinder with low submergence
below the mean water level are shown to be accurately simulated up to the third order in wave steepness.
The second case is a dedicated experiment with a floating barge of rectangular cross-section. This
very challenging case (body with sharp corners in large waves) allows to examine the behavior (...to

The Feynman-alpha method is a neutron noise technique that is used to estimate the prompt neutron
period of fissile assemblies. The method and quantity are of widespread interest including in applications
such as nuclear criticality safety, safeguards and nonproliferation, and stockpile stewardship;
the prompt neutron period may also be used to infer the $k_\text{eff}$ multiplication factor. The
Feynman-alpha method is predicated on time-correlated neutron detections that deviate from a
Poisson random variable due to multiplication. Traditionally, such measurements are diagnosed
with one-region point kinetics, but two-region models are required when the fissile assembly is
reflected. This paper presents a derivation of the two-region point kinetics Feynman-alpha equations
based on a double integration of the Rossi-alpha equations, develops novel propagation of measurement
uncertainty, and validates the theory. Validation is achieved with organic scintillator measurements
of weapons-grade plutonium reflected by various amounts of copper to achieve $k_\text{eff}$ values
of 0.83-0.94 and prompt periods of 5-75 ns. The results demonstrate that Feynman-alpha measurements
should use the two-region model instead of the one-region model. The simplified one-region model
deviates from the validated two-region models by as much as 10\% in the estimate of the prompt neutron
period, and the two-region model reduces to the one-region model for small amounts of reflector.
The Feynman-alpha estimates of the prompt neutron period are compared to those of the Rossi-alpha
approach. The comparative results demonstrate that the Feynman-alpha method is more precise than
the Rossi-alpha method and more accurate for $k_\text{eff}<0.92$, whereas the Rossi-alpha method
is generally more accurate for higher multiplications.

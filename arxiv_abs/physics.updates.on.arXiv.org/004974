In the present study, we consider incompressible multiphase flows, where there can be an arbitrary
number of immiscible phases appearing simultaneously, with each phase having its own density and
viscosity, and with each pair of phases having an interfacial tension at their interfaces and a contact
angle at a wall. A Phase-Field model for this kind of problems is derived from the consistency conditions,
which are the consistency of reduction, the consistency of mass conservation, and the consistency
of mass and momentum transport, and the energy law, which requires that the total energy of the multiphase
system is not increased by the interfacial tensions. A 2nd-order decoupled semi-implicit scheme
is developed and it maintains many physical properties of the Phase-Field model in the discrete
level. The proposed scheme is shown to satisfy all the consistency conditions, to conserve mass,
to avoid generating any fictitious phases, local voids, or overfilling, and to conserve momentum
without interfacial tensions. Two methods, which are the balanced-force method and the conservative
method, are proposed to discretize the surface force. We show that using the conservative method
results in the momentum conservation even including interfacial tensions, while the balanced-force
method leads to an essentially momentum-conserving scheme but has a better balanced-force property.
In addition, our numerical tests show that the energy law is preserved by the scheme, that the numerical
solution of the Phase-Field model convergences to the sharp-interface solution, and that the proposed
model and scheme are robust and effective to study complicated multiphase dynamics, especially
for those including large-density ratios.

Imparting and maintaining surface superhydrophobicity is receiving significant research attention
over the last several years, driven by a broad range of important applications and enabled by advancements
in materials and surface nanoengineering. Researchers have investigated the effect of temperature
on droplet-surface interactions, which poses additional challenges when liquid nucleation manifests
itself, due to ensuing condensation into the surface texture that compromises its anti-wetting
behavior. Maintaining surface transparency at the same time poses an additional and significant
challenge. Often, the solutions proposed are limited by working temperatures or are detrimental
to visibility through the surface. Here we introduce a scalable method employing plasmonic photothermal
metasurface composites, able to harvest sunlight and naturally heat the surface, sustaining water
repellency and transparency under challenging environmental conditions where condensation
and fogging would otherwise be strongly promoted. We demonstrate that these surfaces, when illuminated
by sunlight, can prevent impalement of impacting water droplets, even when the droplet to surface
temperature difference is 50{\deg}C, by suppressing condensate formation within the texture,
maintaining transparency. We also show how the same transparent metasurface coating could be combined
and work collaboratively with hierarchical micro- and nanorough textures, resulting in simultaneous
superior pressure-driven impalement resistance and avoidance of water nucleation and related
possible frosting in supercooled conditions. Our work can find a host of applications as a sustainable
solution against impacting water on surfaces such as windows, eyewear, and optical components.

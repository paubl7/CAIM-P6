The detection and management of diseases become quite complicated when pathogens contain asymptomatic
phenotypes amongst their ranks, as evident during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Spreading of diseases
has been studied extensively under the paradigm of Susceptible - Infected - Recovered - Deceased
(SIRD) dynamics. Various game-theoretic approaches have also addressed disease spread, many
of which consider S, I, R, and D as strategies rather than as states. Remarkably, most studies from
the above approaches do not account for the distinction between the symptomatic or asymptomatic
aspect of the disease. It is well-known that precautionary measures like washing hands, wearing
masks and social distancing significantly mitigate the spread of many contagious diseases. Herein,
we consider the adoption of such precautions as strategies and treat S, I, R, and D as states. We also
attempt to capture the differences in epidemic spreading arising from symptomatic and asymptomatic
diseases on various network topologies. Through extensive computer simulations, we examine that
the cost of maintaining precautionary measures as well as the extent of mass testing in a population
affects the final fraction of socially responsible individuals. We observe that the lack of mass
testing could potentially lead to a pandemic in case of asymptomatic diseases. Network topology
also seems to play an important role. We further observe that the final fraction of proactive individuals
depends on the initial fraction of both infected as well as proactive individuals. Additionally,
edge density can significantly influence the overall outcome. Our findings are in broad agreement
with the lessons learnt from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

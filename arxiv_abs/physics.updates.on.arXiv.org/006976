Low-lying coastal cities across the world are vulnerable to the combined impact of rainfall and
storm tide. However, existing approaches lack the ability to model the combined effect of these
flood mechanisms. Thus, to increase flood resilience, modeling techniques to improve understanding
and prediction of the combined effect of these flood hazards are critical. To address this need,
this study presents a modeling system for assessing the combined flood risk to coastal cities under
changing climate conditions that leverages ocean modeling with land surface modeling capable
of resolving urban drainage infrastructure within the city. The modeling approach is demonstrated
in quantifying the future impact on transportation infrastructure within Norfolk, Virginia USA.
A series of combined storms events are modeled for current (2020) and projected future (2070) climate
conditions. Results show that pluvial flooding causes a larger interruption to the transportation
network compared to tidal flooding under current climate conditions. By 2070, however, tidal flooding
will be the dominant flooding mechanism with even nuisance flooding expected to happen daily due
to SLR. In 2070, nuisance flooding is expected to cause a 4.6% total link close time (TLC), which is
more than two times that of a 50-year storm surge (1.8% TLC) in 2020. The coupled model was compared
with a widely used but physically simplistic bathtub method to assess the difference resulting
from the more complex modeling presented. Results show that the bathtub method overestimated the
flooded area near the shoreline by 9.5% and 3.1% for a 10-year storm surge event in 2020 and 2070, respectively,
but underestimated flooded area in the inland region by 9.0% and 4.0% for the same events. The findings
demonstrate the benefit of sophisticated modeling methods in climate adaptive planning and policy
in coastal communities.

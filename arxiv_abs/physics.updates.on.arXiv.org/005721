In this report, we examine the available evidence regarding ICT's current and projected climate
impacts. We examine peer-reviewed studies which estimate ICT's current share of global greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions to be 1.8-2.8% of global GHG emissions. Our findings indicate that published
estimates all underestimate the carbon footprint of ICT, possibly by as much as 25%, by failing to
account for all of ICT's supply chains and full lifecycle (i.e. emissions scopes 1, 2 and fully inclusive
3). Adjusting for truncation of supply chain pathways, we estimate that ICT's share of emissions
could actually be as high as 2.1-3.9%. There are pronounced differences between available projections
of ICT's future emissions. These projections are dependent on underlying assumptions that are
sometimes, but not always, made explicit - and we explore these in the report. Whatever assumptions
analysts take, they agree that ICT will not reduce its emissions without a major concerted effort
involving broad political and industrial action. We provide three reasons to believe ICT emissions
are going to increase barring a targeted intervention, and we note that in light of these, it seems
risky to assume that ICT will, by default, assist in the attainment of climate targets. Based on our
analysis, we find that not all carbon pledges in the ICT sector are ambitious enough to meet climate
targets. We explore the underdevelopment of mechanisms for enforcing sector-wide compliance,
and contend that without a global carbon constraint, a new regulatory framework is required to keep
the ICT sector's carbon footprint in alignment with the Paris Agreement. We further contend that
a global carbon constraint should be viewed as a significant opportunity for the ICT sector, as efficiencies
within and enabled by ICT would be even greater enablers of productivity and utility than they are
today.

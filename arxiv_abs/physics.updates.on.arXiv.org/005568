The efficiency of tidal-stream turbines in a large array depends on the balance between negative
effects of turbine-wake interactions and positive effects of bypass-flow acceleration due to
local blockage, both of which are functions of the layout of turbines. Here we investigate the hydrodynamics
of turbines in an infinitely large array with aligned or staggered layouts for a range of streamwise
and lateral turbine spacing. First, we present a theoretical analysis based on an extension of the
Linear Momentum Actuator Disc Theory (LMADT) for perfectly aligned and staggered layouts, employing
a hybrid inviscid-viscous approach to account for the local blockage effect within each turbine
row and the viscous (turbulent) wake mixing behind each row in a coupled manner. We perform Large-Eddy
Simulation (LES) of open-channel flow for 28 layouts of tidal turbines using an Actuator-Line Method
with periodic boundary conditions. Both theoretical and LES results show that the efficiency of
turbines (or the power of turbines for a given bulk velocity) in an aligned array decreases as we reduce
the streamwise spacing, whereas that in a staggered array remains high and may even increase due
to the positive local blockage effect (causing the local flow velocity upstream of each turbine
to exceed the bulk velocity) if the lateral turbine spacing is sufficiently small. The LES results
further reveal that the amplitude of wake meandering tends to decrease as we reduce the lateral spacing,
which leads to a lower wake recovery rate in the near-wake region. These results will help to understand
and improve the efficiency of tidal turbines in future large arrays, even though the performance
of real tidal arrays may depend not only on turbine-to-turbine interactions but also on macro-scale
interactions between the array and natural tidal currents, the latter of which are outside the scope
of this study.

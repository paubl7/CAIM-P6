The Alcubierre warp drive metric is a spacetime geometry featuring a spacetime distortion, called
warp bubble, where a massive particle inside it acquires global superluminal velocities, or warp
speeds. This work presents solutions of the Einstein equations for the Alcubierre metric having
fluid matter as gravity source. The energy-momentum tensor considered two fluid contents, the
perfect fluid and the parametrized perfect fluid (PPF), a tentative more flexible model whose aim
is to explore the possibilities of warp drive solutions with positive matter density content. Santos-Pereira
et al. (2020; arXiv:2008.06560) have already showed that the Alcubierre metric having dust as source
connects this geometry to the Burgers equation, which describes shock waves moving through an inviscid
fluid, but led the solutions back to vacuum. The same happened for two out of four solutions subcases
for the perfect fluid. Other solutions for the perfect fluid indicate the possibility of warp drive
with positive matter density, but at the cost of a complex solution for the warp drive regulating
function. Regarding the PPF, solutions were also obtained indicating that warp speeds could be
created with positive matter density. Weak, dominant, strong and null energy conditions were calculated
for all studied subcases, being satisfied for the perfect fluid and creating constraints in the
PPF quantities such that positive matter density is also possible for creating a warp bubble. Summing
up all results,energy-momentum tensors describing more complex forms of matter, or field, distributions
generate solutions for the Einstein equations with the warp drive metric where negative matter
density might not be a strict precondition for attaining warp speeds.

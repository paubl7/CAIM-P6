Short bunch proton beams are of great significance for the applications of white neutron beams and
muon beams. The accelerator complex of China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) was designed to support
the applications mainly based on neutron scattering techniques where the proton pulse length is
not very sensitive. Some theoretical and experimental studies have been performed to see if one
can extract a short-bunch proton beam by bunch rotation from the rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS)
at CSNS. The experimental results at RCS have evidently displayed the bunch lengthening and rotation
process, which demonstrates the effectiveness of this method even with a very short available time
for the RF gymnastic processes and a high-intensity beam. With a beam power of 50 kW and normal longitudinal
emittance at the injection, the proton beam with a bunch length of about 53% with respect to the one
in the normal operation mode was obtained and transported to the spallation target. With a reduced
longitudinal emittance at injection and the beam power of 30 kW, the shortest extraction bunch length
obtained is about 26% of the one in the normal operation mode. Different machine settings have also
been tested to show the impact of the desynchronization between the RF and magnetic fields, the influence
of the non-adiabatic risetime and the adiabatic decay time of the RF voltage on the extraction bunch
length. The experimental results are well consistent with the theoretical and simulated ones.
It is interesting to observe that space charge has a beneficial effect on the bunch lengthening which
will result in a shorter bunch at the extraction with the later bunch rotation. The controlled desynchronization
method between the RF and magnetic fields in an RCS was also proven successful.

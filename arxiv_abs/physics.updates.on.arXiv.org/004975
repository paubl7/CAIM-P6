Recent experiments (gedanken or otherwise) and theorems in quantum mechanics (QM), such as new
iterations on Wigner's friend and delayed choice, have led many people to claim that QM is not compatible
with determinate and intersubjectively consistent experience (what some call absoluteness of
observed events), such as experiences of experimental outcomes. In the case of delayed choice the
tension is between our experience of free will and a possible "superdeterminism" at work in QM. At
the very least, some have suggested that the only way to save absoluteness of observed events, is
to give up one or more of the following assumptions: free will, locality, or the completeness of QM.
Our goal in this paper is to provide a take on QM that explains why there is and must always be determinate
and intersubjectively consistent experience about all experimental outcomes (absoluteness
of observed events). Our take accepts the completeness of the theory and requires no invocation
of relative states (e.g., outcomes being relative to branches, conscious observers, etc.). And
finally, this take requires no allegedly hybrid models such as claims about "subjective collapse."
We provide a take on QM that yields a single world wherein all the observers (conscious or otherwise)
agree about determinate and definite outcomes, because those outcomes are in fact determinate
and definite. We provide a realist psi-epistemic take on QM that saves the absoluteness of observed
events and the completeness of QM, without giving up free will or locality. We also show how our realist
psi-epistemic account eliminates the measurement problem and, coupled with our take on neutral
monism, also eliminates the hard problem of consciousness.

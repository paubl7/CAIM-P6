A population balance model coupled with large eddy simulations (LES) is adapted and applied to study
the evolution of oil droplets in a turbulent jet including the effects of droplet breakup. A key unknown
in simulating secondary breakup in turbulent multiphase jets is the inflow size distribution generated
within the primary breakup zone near the nozzle exit. A mono-disperse injection inflow condition
is commonly used for simplicity, but this choice is often unrealistic. In order to provide more realistic
inlet conditions for LES, we develop a one dimensional (1D) parcel model to predict the evolution
of the dispersed phase along the jet centerline due to the combined effects of advection, radial
turbulent transport and droplet breakup due to turbulence in the regions closer to the jet nozzle
that cannot be resolved using coarse LES. The model is validated with experimental data measured
far from the nozzle. The 1D model is also used to generate an initial size distribution for use in a
coarse-resolution LES of a turbulent jet. Number density fields for each bin of the discretized
droplet size distribution are modeled using an Eulerian LES approach and scalar transport equations
are solved for each bin. LES results are compared to published experimental data, with good agreement
and we examine the statistics of the velocity field and the concentration of the polydisperse oil
droplet plumes for two droplet Weber numbers. We find that the centerline decay rate of the concentration
for different droplet sizes is modified in the breakup dominated zone. Unlike Reynolds averaged
approaches, LES also allows us to quantify size distribution variability due to turbulence. We
quantify the radial and axial distributions and the variability of key quantities such as the Sauter
mean diameter, total surface area and droplet breakup time-scale and explore their sensitivity
to the Weber number.

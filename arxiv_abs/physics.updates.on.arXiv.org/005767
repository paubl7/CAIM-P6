This is a review of exciton dynamics in conjugated polymers. Exciton dynamics encompass multiple
time and length scales. Ultrafast femtosecond processes are intrachain and involve a quantum mechanical
correlation of the exciton and nuclear degrees of freedom. In contrast, post-picosecond processes
involve the incoherent Forster transfer of excitons between polymer chains. Exciton dynamics
is also strongly determined by the spatial and temporal disorder that is ubiquitous in conjugated
polymers. Since excitons are delocalized over hundreds of atoms, a theoretical understanding
of these processes is only realistically possible by employing suitably parametrized coarse-grained
exciton-phonon models. Moreover, to correctly account for ultrafast processes, the exciton and
phonon modes must be treated on the same quantum mechanical basis and the Ehrenfest approximation
must be abandoned. This further implies that sophisticated numerical techniques must be employed
to solve these models. We begin by describing the energetic and spatial distribution of excitons
in disordered polymer systems. Next, we discuss ultrafast intrachain exciton decoherence caused
by exciton-phonon entanglement, which leads to fluorescence depolarization on the timescale
of 10-fs. Interactions of the polymer with its environment causes the stochastic relaxation and
localization of high-energy delocalized excitons onto chromophores. The coupling of excitons
with torsional modes also leads to various dynamical processes. On sub-ps timescales it causes
exciton density localization and local polymer planarization, while on post-ps timescales stochastic
torsional fluctuations cause exciton diffusion along the polymer chain. Finally, we describe
a first-principles, Forster-type model of intrachain exciton transfer and diffusion, whose starting
point is a realistic description of the donor and acceptor chromophores.

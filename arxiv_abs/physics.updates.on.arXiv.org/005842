Metasurfaces are subwavelength-thick constructs, consisting of discrete meta-atoms, providing
discretized levels of phase accumulation that collectively approximate a designed optical functionality.
The meta-atoms utilizing geometric phase with polarization-converting structures produced
encouraging implementations of optical components including metalenses. However, to date, a
pending and fundamental problem of this approach has been the low device efficiency that such resulting
components suffer, an unwanted side effect of large lattice constants used for preventing inter-coupling
of their meta-atoms. Although the use of near-field coupling for tuning electromagnetic resonances
found its use in constructing efficient narrow-band designs, such structures fell short of providing
high efficiency over a broad spectrum. Here, we propose and show that tightly packed fabric of identical
dielectric nanopillar waveguides with continuously-tuned inter-coupling distances make excellent
and complete achromatic metasurface elements. This architecture enables the scatterers to interact
with the incoming wave extremely efficiently. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we showed
an achromatic cylindrical metalens, constructed from strongly coupled dielectric nanopillars
of a single geometry as continuously-set phase elements in a 'meta-atomless' fashion, working
in the entirety of 400-700 nm band. This metalens achieves over 85 percent focusing efficiency across
this whole spectral range. To combat polarization sensitivity, we used hexagonally stacked nanopillars
to build up a polarization-independent scatterer library. Finally, a circular metalens with polarization-independent
operation and achromatic focusing was obtained. This is a paradigm shift in making an achromatic
metasurface architecture by wovening identical nanopillars coupled into an irregular lattice
constructed via careful tuning.

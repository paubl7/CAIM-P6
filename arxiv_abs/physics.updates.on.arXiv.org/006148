Students develop and test simple kinetic models of the spread of COVID-19 caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2
virus. Microsoft Excel is used as the modeling platform because it's non-threatening to students
and because it's widely available. Students develop simple finite difference models and implement
them in the cells of preformatted spreadsheets following a guided-inquiry pedagogy. Students
fit the resulting models to reported cases-per-day data for the United States using least-squares
techniques with Excel's Solver. Using their own spreadsheets, students discover for themselves
that the initial exponential growth of COVID-19 can be explained by a simplified unlimited growth
model and by the SIR model. They also discover that the effects of social distancing during April
and May 2020 can be modeled using a Gaussian transition function for the infection rate coefficient
that can be easily implemented in Excel. Answering similar active-learning questions, students
discover that the summer surge was caused by prematurely relaxing social distancing and then reimposing
stricter social distancing. By fitting published infection rate data up to Thanksgiving (November
26, 2020), students discover that the beginning of the fall surge can be explained by a return to more
relaxed social distancing with a similar infection rate constant as the inception of the summer
surge. Students then model the effect of vaccinations and validate the resulting SIR-V model by
showing that it successfully predicts the reported cases-per-day data from November 26, 2020 through
the holiday period up to February 20, 2021. The success of the model in predicting the spread of COVID-19
during that time is a remarkable validation of the SIR model and its SIR-V variant. See this http URL

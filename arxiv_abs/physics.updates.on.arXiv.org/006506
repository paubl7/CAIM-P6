Current climate shift has significant impacts on both quality and quantity of snow precipitation.
This directly influences spatial variability of the snowpack as well as cumulative snow height.
Contemporary glacier retreat reorganizes periglacial morphology: while the glacier area decreases,
the moraine area increases. The latter is becoming a new water storage potential almost as important
as the glacier itself, but with a much more complex topography. This work hence fills one of the missing
variables of the hydrological budget equation of an arctic glacier basin by providing an estimate
of the snow water equivalent (SWE) of the moraine contribution. Such a result is achieved by investigating
Structure from Motion (SfM) image processing applied to pictures collected from an Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) as a method to produce snow depth maps over the proglacial moraine area. Several UAV
campaigns were carried out on a small glacial basin in Spitsbergen (Arctic): measurements were
made at the maximum snow accumulation season (late April) while reference topography maps were
acquired at the end of hydrological year (late September) when the moraine is mostly free of snow.
Snow depth is determined from Digital Surface Model (DSM) subtraction. Using dedicated and natural
ground control points for relative positioning of the DSMs, the relative DSM georeferencing with
sub-meter accuracy removes the main source of uncertainty when assessing snow depth. For areas
where snow is deposited on bare rock surfaces, the correlation between avalanche probe in-situ
snow depth measurements and DSM differences is excellent. Differences in ice covered areas between
the two measurement techniques are attributed to the different quantities measured.

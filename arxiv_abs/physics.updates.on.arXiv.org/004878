The design of a primary electron beam facility at CERN is described. It re-enables the SPS as an electron
accelerator, and leverages the development invested in CLIC technology for its injector and as
accelerator R&D infrastructure. The facility would be relevant for several of the key priorities
in the 2020 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics, such as an e+e- Higgs factory, accelerator
R&D, dark sector physics, and neutrino physics. In addition, it could serve experiments in nuclear
physics. The electron beam delivered by this facility would provide access to light dark matter
production significantly beyond the targets predicted by a thermal dark matter origin, and for
natures of dark matter particles that are not accessible by direct detection experiments. It would
also enable electro-nuclear measurements crucial for precise modelling the energy dependence
of neutrino-nucleus interactions, which is needed to precisely measure neutrino oscillations
as a function of energy. The implementation of the facility is the natural next step in the development
of X-band high-gradient acceleration technology, a key technology for compact and cost-effective
electron/positron linacs. It would also become the only facility with multi-GeV drive bunches
and truly independent electron witness bunches for plasma wakefield acceleration. The facility
would be used for the development and studies of a large number of components and phenomena for a future
e+e- Higgs and electroweak factory as the first stage of a next circular collider at CERN, and its
cavities in the SPS would be the same type as foreseen for such a future collider. The operation of
the SPS with electrons would train a new generation of CERN staff on circular electron accelerators.
The facility could be made operational in about five years and would operate in parallel and without
interference with Run 4 at the LHC.

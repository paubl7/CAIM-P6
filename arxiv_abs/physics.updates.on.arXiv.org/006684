Radiation-dust driven outflows, where radiation pressure on dust grains accelerates gas, occur
in many astrophysical environments. Almost all previous numerical studies of these systems have
assumed that the dust was perfectly-coupled to the gas. However, it has recently been shown that
the dust in these systems is unstable to a large class of 'resonant drag instabilities' (RDIs) which
de-couple the dust and gas dynamics and could qualitatively change the nonlinear outcome of these
outflows. We present the first simulations of radiation-dust driven outflows in stratified, inhomogeneous
media, including explicit grain dynamics and a realistic spectrum of grain sizes and charge, magnetic
fields and Lorentz forces on grains (which dramatically enhance the RDIs), Coulomb and Epstein
drag forces, and explicit radiation transport allowing for different grain absorption and scattering
properties. In this paper we consider conditions resembling giant molecular clouds (GMCs), HII
regions, and distributed starbursts, where optical depths are modest ($\lesssim 1$), single-scattering
effects dominate radiation-dust coupling, Lorentz forces dominate over drag on grains, and the
fastest-growing RDIs are similar, such as magnetosonic and fast-gyro RDIs. These RDIs generically
produce strong size-dependent dust clustering, growing nonlinear on timescales that are much
shorter than the characteristic times of the outflow. The instabilities produce filamentary and
plume-like or 'horsehead' nebular morphologies that are remarkably similar to observed dust structures
in GMCs and HII regions. Additionally, in some cases they strongly alter the magnetic field structure
and topology relative to filaments. Despite driving strong micro-scale dust clumping which leaves
some gas 'behind,' an order-unity fraction of the gas is always efficiently entrained by dust.

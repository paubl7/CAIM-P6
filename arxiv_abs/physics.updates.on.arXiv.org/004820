The paper is concerned with an adjoint complement to the Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) method for immiscible
two-phase flows, e.g. air and water, which is widely used in marine engineering due to its computational
efficiency. The particular challenge of the primal and the corresponding adjoint VoF-approach
refers to the sharp interface treatment featuring discontinuous physical properties. Both the
continuous adjoint two-phase system (integration-by-parts) and the corresponding dual compressive
convection schemes (summation-by-parts) are derived for two prominent compressive convection
schemes, namely the High Resolution Interface Capturing Scheme (HRIC) and Compressive Interface
Capturing Scheme for Arbitrary Meshes (CICSAM). The dual scheme rigorously mirrors the primal
Normalized-Variable-Diagram (NVD) stencils. Attention is restricted to steady state applications.
Thus both the primal and the dual procedures are performed in pseudo time and the backward integration
of the dual approach is performed around the (pseudo-temporal) converged primal field. The paper
analyses the primal and adjoint equations for an engineering model problem. An analytical solution
to the model problem is initially presented, which displays that the adjoint part does not offer
a unique, non-trivial solution. As a remedy, an additional diffusive concentration term is introduced
to the adjoint concentration equation. Numerical results obtained from the modified approach
are benchmarked against the analytical solution for the model problem. Supplementary, the influence
of the modification on the sensitivities obtained from simulations for the two-dimensional flow
around a submerged hydrofoil are discussed. The final application refers to a shape-optimization
of a generic 3D underwater vehicle and underlines a negligible influence of the free mobility parameter.

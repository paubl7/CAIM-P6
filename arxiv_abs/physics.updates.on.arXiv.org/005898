Coriolis-centrifugal convection (C$^3$) in a cylindrical domain constitutes an idealised model
of tornadic storms, where the rotating cylinder represents the mesocyclone of a supercell thunderstorm.
We present a suite of C$^3$ direct numerical simulations, analysing the influence of centrifugal
buoyancy on the formation of tornado-like vortices (TLVs). TLVs are self-consistently generated
provided the flow is within the quasi-cyclostrophic (QC) regime. This requires the Froude number
to be greater than the radius-to-height aspect ratio, $Fr \gtrsim \gamma$. We show that the TLVs
share many features with realistic tornadoes, such as azimuthal velocity profiles, intensification
of the vortex strength, and helicity characteristics. Further, we analyse the influence of the
mechanical bottom boundary conditions on the formation of TLVs, finding that a rotating fluid column
above a stationary surface does not generate TLVs if centrifugal buoyancy is absent. In contrast,
TLVs are generated in the QC regime with any bottom boundary conditions when centrifugal buoyancy
is present. Our simulations bring forth insights into natural supercell thunderstorm systems
by identifying properties that determine whether a mesocyclone becomes tornadic or remains non-tornadic.
Our $Fr \gtrsim \gamma$ predictions dimensionally imply a critical mesocyclone angular rotation
rate of $\widetilde{\Omega}_{mc} \gtrsim \sqrt{g/H_{mc}}$. Taking a typical mesocyclone height
of $H_{mc}\approx 12$ km, this translates to $\widetilde{\Omega}_{mc}\gtrsim 3~\times~10^{-2}$s$^{-1}$
for centrifugal buoyancy-dominated, quasi-cyclostrophic tornadogenesis. The formation of
the simulated TLVs happens at all heights on the centrifugal buoyancy time scale $\tau_{cb}$. This
implies a roughly 1 minute, height-invariant formation for natural tornadoes, consistent with
recent observational estimates.

Spintronic structures are extensively investigated for their spin orbit torque properties, required
for magnetic commutation functionalities. Current progress in these materials is dependent on
the interface engineering for the optimization of spin transmission. Here, we advance the analysis
of ultrafast spin-charge conversion phenomena at ferromagnetic-transition metal interfaces
due to their inverse spin-Hall effect properties. In particular the intrinsic inverse spin Hall
effect of Pt-based systems and extrinsic inverse spin-Hall effect of Au:W and Au:Ta in NiFe/Au:(W,Ta)
bilayers are investigated. The spin-charge conversion is probed by complementary techniques
-- ultrafast THz time domain spectroscopy in the dynamic regime for THz pulse emission and ferromagnetic
resonance spin-pumping measurements in the GHz regime in the steady state -- to determine the role
played by the material properties, resistivities, spin transmission at metallic interfaces and
spin-flip rates. These measurements show the correspondence between the THz time domain spectroscopy
and ferromagnetic spin-pumping for the different set of samples in term of the spin mixing conductance.
The latter quantity is a critical parameter, determining the strength of the THz emission from spintronic
interfaces. This is further supported by ab-initio calculations, simulations and analysis of
the spin-diffusion and spin relaxation of carriers within the multilayers in the time domain, permitting
to determine the main trends and the role of spin transmission at interfaces. This work illustrates
that time domain spectroscopy for spin-based THz emission is a powerful technique to probe spin-dynamics
at active spintronic interfaces and to extract key material properties for spin-charge conversion.

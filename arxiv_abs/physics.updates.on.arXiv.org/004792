Purpose: Body composition is known to be associated with many diseases including diabetes, cancers
and cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we developed a fully automatic body tissue decomposition
procedure to segment three major compartments that are related to body composition analysis - subcutaneous
adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and muscle. Three additional compartments
- the ventral cavity, lung and bones were also segmented during the segmentation process to assist
segmentation of the major compartments. Methods: A convolutional neural network (CNN) model with
densely connected layers was developed to perform ventral cavity segmentation. An image processing
workflow was developed to segment the ventral cavity in any patient's CT using the CNN model, then
further segment the body tissue into multiple compartments using hysteresis thresholding followed
by morphological operations. It is important to segment ventral cavity firstly to allow accurate
separation of compartments with similar Hounsfield unit (HU) inside and outside the ventral cavity.
Results: The ventral cavity segmentation CNN model was trained and tested with manually labelled
ventral cavities in 60 CTs. Dice scores (mean +/- standard deviation) for ventral cavity segmentation
were 0.966+/-0.012. Tested on CT datasets with intravenous (IV) and oral contrast, the Dice scores
were 0.96+/-0.02, 0.94+/-0.06, 0.96+/-0.04, 0.95+/-0.04 and 0.99+/-0.01 for bone, VAT, SAT,
muscle and lung, respectively. The respective Dice scores were 0.97+/-0.02, 0.94+/-0.07, 0.93+/-0.06,
0.91+/-0.04 and 0.99+/-0.01 for non-contrast CT datasets. Conclusion: A body tissue decomposition
procedure was developed to automatically segment multiple compartments of the ventral body. The
proposed method enables fully automated quantification of 3D ventral body composition metrics
from CT images.

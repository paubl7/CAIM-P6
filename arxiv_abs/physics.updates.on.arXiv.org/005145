The rheological behaviors of suspension of ideally conductive particles in an electric field are
studied using large-scale numerical simulations in the limit of zero-shear-rate flow. Under the
action of an electric field, the particles undergo the nonlinear electrokinetic phenomenon termed
as dipolophoresis, which is the combination of dielectrophoresis and induced-charge electrophoresis.
For ideally conductive particles, the dynamics of the suspension are primarily controlled by induced-charge
electrophoresis. To characterize the rheological properties of the suspension, the particle
stress tensor and particle pressure are calculated in a range of volume fraction up to almost random
close packing. The particle normal stress and particle pressure are shown to behave non-monotonically
with volume fraction, especially in concentrated regimes. In particular, the particle pressure
is positive for volume fraction up to 30\%, after which it becomes negative, indicating a change
in the nature of the particle pressure. The microstructure expressed by pair distribution function
and suspension entropy is also evaluated. Visible variations in the local microstructure seem
to correlate with the non-monotonic variation in the particle normal stresses and particle pressure.
These non-monotonic behaviors are also correlated with the change in the dominant mechanism of
particle pairing dynamics observed in our recent study [Mirfendereski \& Park, J. Fluid Mech. \textbf{875},
R3 (2019)]. Lastly, the effects of confinement on the particle stress and particle pressure are
investigated. It is found that the particle pressure changes its nature very quickly at high volume
fractions as the level of confinement increases. This study should motivate control strategies
to fully exploit the distinct changing nature of the pressure for rheological manipulation of such
suspension system.

Earthquakes are measured using well defined seismic parameters such as seismic moment (Mo), moment
magnitude (Mw), and released elastic energy(E). How this tremendous amount of energy is accumulated
silently deep inside the earth's crust? The most obvious question in seismic research remains unanswered.
We found an inherent and intriguing connection between the released energy in an earthquake and
electrochemical potential induced in an ultra-thin metal oxide electrode immersed in an aqueous
pH solution, which leads us to understand the origin of the energy accumulation process in an earthquake.
A huge electrochemical potential is accumulated from numerous electrochemical cells formed in
a unique layer structure of hydrated clay minerals (predominantly smectite), which resulted in
a lightning-like discharge in the lithosphere (hypocenter). The subsequent thunder-like massive
shockwave is produced, which initiates tectonic plate movement along a fault line, probably through
acoustic fluidization (AF), and resulting seismic energy is transmitted as primary wave (P-wave),
secondary wave (S-wave), and surface waves. The presence of electrical voltage in the hypocenter
directly supports the seismic electric signal (SES), further strengthening the VAN method of earthquake
prediction. Our finding is supported by a plethora of research and observation devoted to seismic
science. This study will indeed find its significance if immediate action is implemented to monitor
the evolution of electrochemical potential, seismic electrical signal (SES), and ionic activity
in the fault zone at lithosphere as well as in the ionosphere for predicting an impending earthquake
for saving human lives as early as possible.

Fuel sprays produce high-velocity, jet-like flows that impart turbulence onto the ambient flow
field. The spray-induced turbulence augments fuel-air mixing, which has a primary role in controlling
pollutant formation and cyclic variability in engines. This paper presents tomographic particle
image velocimetry (TPIV) measurements to analyse the 3D spray-induced turbulence during the intake
stroke of a direct-injection engine. The spray produces a strong spray-induced jet in the far field,
which travels through the cylinder and imparts turbulence onto the surrounding flow. Planar high-speed
PIV measurements at 4.8 kHz are combined with TPIV at 3.3 Hz to evaluate spray particle distributions
and validate TPIV measurements in the particle-laden flow. An uncertainty analysis is performed
to assess the uncertainty associated with vorticity and strain rate components. TPIV analyses
quantify the spatial domain of the turbulence in relation to the SIJ and describe how turbulent flow
features such as turbulent kinetic energy, strain rate and vorticity evolve into the surrounding
flow field. Access to the full tensors facilitate the evaluation of turbulence for individual spray
events. TPIV images reveal the presence of strong shear layers (visualized by high S magnitudes)
and pockets of elevated vorticity along the immediate boundary of the SIJ. Values are extracted
from spatial domains extending in 1mm increments from the SIJ. Turbulence levels are greatest within
the 0-1mm region from the SIJ boarder and dissipate with radial distance. Individual strain rate
and vorticity components are analyzed in detail to describe the relationship between local strain
rates and 3D vortical structures produced within strong shear layers of the SIJ. Analyses are intended
to understand the flow features responsible for rapid fuel-air mixing and provide valuable data
for the development of numerical models.

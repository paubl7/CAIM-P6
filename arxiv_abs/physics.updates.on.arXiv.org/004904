Collisionless space plasma environments are typically characterised by distinct particle populations.
Although moments of their velocity distribution functions help in distinguishing different plasma
regimes, the distribution functions themselves provide more comprehensive information about
the plasma state, especially at times when the distribution function includes non-thermal effects.
Unlike moments, however, distribution functions are not easily characterised by a small number
of parameters, making their classification more difficult to achieve. In order to perform this
classification, we propose to distinguish between the different plasma regions by applying dimensionality
reduction and clustering methods to electron distributions in pitch angle and energy space. We
utilise four separate algorithms to achieve our plasma classifications: autoencoders, principal
component analysis, mean shift, and agglomerative clustering. We test our classification algorithms
by applying our scheme to data from the Cluster-PEACE instrument measured in the Earth's magnetotail.
Traditionally, it is thought that the Earth's magnetotail is split into three different regions
(the plasma sheet, the plasma sheet boundary layer, and the lobes), that are primarily defined by
their plasma characteristics. Starting with the ECLAT database with associated classifications
based on the plasma parameters, we identify 8 distinct groups of distributions, that are dependent
upon significantly more complex plasma and field dynamics. By comparing the average distributions
as well as the plasma and magnetic field parameters for each region, we relate several of the groups
to different plasma sheet populations, and the rest we attribute to the plasma sheet boundary layer
and the lobes. We find clear distinctions between each of our classified regions and the ECLAT results.

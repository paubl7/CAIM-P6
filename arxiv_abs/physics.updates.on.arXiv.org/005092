On the occasion of the 50th anniversary since the beginning of the search for gravitational waves
at the Max Planck Society, and in coincidence with the 25th anniversary of the foundation of the Albert
Einstein Institute, we explore the interplay between the renaissance of general relativity and
the advent of relativistic astrophysics following the German early involvement in gravitational-wave
research, to the point when gravitational-wave detection became established by the appearance
of full-scale detectors and international collaborations. On the background of the spectacular
astrophysical discoveries of the 1960s and the growing role of relativistic astrophysics, Ludwig
Biermann and his collaborators at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich became deeply
involved in research related to such new horizons. At the end of the 1960s, Joseph Weber's announcements
claiming detection of gravitational waves sparked the decisive entry of this group into the field,
in parallel with the appointment of the renowned relativist Juergen Ehlers. The Munich area group
of Max Planck institutes provided the fertile ground for acquiring a leading position in the 1970s,
facilitating the experimental transition from resonant bars towards laser interferometry and
its innovation at increasingly large scales, eventually moving to a dedicated site in Hannover
in the early 1990s. The Hannover group emphasized perfecting experimental systems at pilot scales,
and never developed a full-sized detector, rather joining the LIGO Scientific Collaboration at
the end of the century. In parallel, the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert
Einstein Institute) had been founded in Potsdam, and both sites, in Hannover and Potsdam, became
a unified entity in the early 2000s and were central contributors to the first detection of gravitational
waves in 2015.

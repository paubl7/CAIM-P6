The aim of this work is to investigate the corrosion inhibition of the mild steel in the 1 M HCl solution
by the 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogensulphate, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogensulphate,
and 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, using electrochemical, weight loss, and surface
analysis methods as well as the full quantum-mechanical treatment. Polarization measurements
prove that studied compounds are mixed-type inhibitors with predominantly anodic reaction. The
inhibition efficiency obtained from the polarization curves is about 80-92% for all of the 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium
salts with the concentration higher than 0.005 mol dm$^{-3}$, while it is much lower for 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
hydrogensulphate. The values measured in the weight loss experiments (after seven days) are to
some extent higher (reaching up to 98% efficiency). We have shown that the influence of the alkyl
chain length on the inhibition efficiency is much larger than that of the anion type. Furthermore,
we obtain a realistic model of a single molecule on iron surface Fe(110) by applying the Density Functional
Theory calculations. We use the state-of-the-art computational approach, including the meta-GGA
strongly-constrained and appropriately normed semilocal density functional to model the electronic
structure properties of both free and bounded-to-surface molecules of 1-butyl-, 1-hexyl-, and
1-octyl-3-methylimizadolium bromide, chloride, and hydrogensulphate. From our calculations
we extract the HOMO/LUMO gap, hardness, electronegativity, and charge transfer of electrons from/to
molecules-in-question. It supports the experimental findings and explains the infuence of the
alkyl chain length and the functional group on the inhibition process.

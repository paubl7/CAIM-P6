New insight into the contribution of the microscale vortex evolution towards convection heat transfer
in porous media is presented in this paper. The objective is to determine how the microscale vortices
influence convection heat transfer in turbulent flow inside porous media. The microscale temperature
distribution is analyzed using flow visualization in 2D using streamlines and in 3D using Q structures.
The pertinent observations are supplemented with the comparison of surface skin friction and heat
transfer using: (1) surface skin friction lines and (2) joint PDF of Skin Friction Coefficient,
along with the Nusselt number. The microscale flow phenomena observed are corroborated with the
features of the frequency spectra of the drag coefficient and macroscale Nusselt number. The Large
Eddy Simulation technique is used to investigate the flow field inside a periodic porous medium.
The Reynolds number of the flow is 300. The porous medium consists of solid obstacles in the shape
of square and circular cylinders. Two distinct flow regimes are represented by using the porosities
of 0.50 and 0.87. The results show that the surface Nusselt number distribution is dependent on whether
the micro-vortices are attached to or detached from the surface of the obstacle. The spectra of the
macroscale Nusselt number and the pressure drag are similar signifying a correlation between the
dynamics of heat transfer and the microscale turbulent structures. Both vortex shedding and secondary
flow instabilities are observed that significantly influence the Nusselt number. The fundamental
insight gained in this paper can inform the development of more robust macroscale models of convection
heat transfer in turbulent flow in porous media.

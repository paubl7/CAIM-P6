On-demand ridepooling (ODRP) can become a powerful alternative to reduce congestion and emissions,
if it attracts private car users. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the strategic phenomena that
determine when ODRP systems can run efficiently. In this paper, we analyze the performance of an
ODRP system, in which the fleet of low-capacity vehicles is endogenously adapted to the demand,
and operated in a zone covered by a single transit line. The routing of the on-demand fleet follows
some of the rules of public transport systems; namely, it is not-for-profit, some users can be required
to walk, and all requests must be served. Considering both users' and operators' costs we identify
two sources of scale economies: when demand grows, the average cost is reduced due to a) an equivalent
of the Mohring Effect (also present in public transport), and b) due to matching users with more similar
routes when they are assigned to the vehicles, which we call Better-matching Effect. A counter-balance
force, called Flex-route Effect, is observed when the vehicle loads increase and users face longer
detours. We find a specific demand range in which the latter effect dominates the others, imposing
diseconomies of scale when only users' costs are considered. Such a phenomenon emerges because
the routes are not fixed; hence, it is not observed in traditional public transport systems. However,
when considering both users' and operators' costs, scale economies prevail. Our simulations show
that relaxing door-to-door vehicle requirements to allow short walks is crucial for the performance
of ODRP. In fact, we observe that an ODRP system with human-driven vehicles and walks allowed has
a total cost at a similar level to that of a door-to-door ODRP system with driverless vehicles.

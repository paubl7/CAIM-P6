The International Height Reference System (IHRS) adopted by the IAG in 2015 contains two novelties.
First, the mean-tide system is adopted for handling the permanent tide. Second, the reference level
of height system is defined by the equipotential surface where the geopotential has a conventional
value W0=62636853.4 m2s-2. This value was first determined empirically to provide a good approximation
to the global mean sea level and then adopted as a reference value by convention. I analyse the tidal
aspects of the reference level based on W0. The W0 is by definition independent of the tidal system
adopted for the equipotential surface, but for different tidal systems, different functions are
involved in the W of the equation W=W0. I find that the empirical determination of the adopted estimate
W0 is inconsistent from the viewpoint of tidal systems. However, the adopted estimate and the consistent
estimate from the same data round off to the same value. I propose a simplified definition of IHRF
geopotential numbers that would make it possible to transform between IHRF and zero-tide geopotential
numbers using a simple datum-difference surface. IHRF should adopt a conventional (best) estimate
of the permanent tidal potential such as is contained in the IERS Conventions and use it as a basis
for other conventional formulas. The tide-free coordinates of the ITRF, and tide-free Global Geopotential
Models are central in the modelling of geopotential for the purposes of the IHRF. I present a set of
correction formulas that can be used to move to the zero-tide model before, in the middle, or after
the processing, and finally to the mean-tide IHRF. To reduce the confusion around the multitude
of tidal systems I propose that modelling should primarily done in the zero-tide system, with the
mean-tide potential as an add-on.

The concept of 'complexity' plays a central role in complex network science, being typically related
to degree heterogeneity. However, given that the degree distribution is not enough to provide an
invertible representation of a given network, additional complementary measurements are required.
In the present work, we aim at obtaining a new model of complex networks, called hypercomplex networks
-- HC, that is characterized by heterogeneity not only of the degree distribution, but also of a relatively
complete set of complementary topological measurements. The proposed model starts with uniformly
random networks, namely Erdos-Renyi structures, and then applies optimization so as to increase
an index of the overall complexity of the networks. Two optimization approaches have been considered:
gradient descent, and the same with simulated annealing. The complexity index currently corresponds
to the average of the coefficient of variation of the several considered measurements. Several
interesting results are reported and discussed, including the fact that the HC networks define,
as the optimization proceeds, a trajectory in the principal component space of the measurements
that tends to depart from the considered theoretical models, heading to a previously empty space
(low density of cases). For relatively small number of nodes, the HC networks have been observed
to saturate, at least for a transient period, their complexity after a given number of optimization
steps, yielding structures characterized by enhanced heterogeneity of each considered topological
measurement, but with clustering coefficient near zero. For larger HC networks, we observed that
the networks can start, after a considerably large number of optimization steps, a peripheral branching
structure that further enhances the complexity of these networks.

Aims. We aim to determine whether dissociative excitation of cometary neutrals by electron impact
is the major source of far-ultraviolet (FUV) emissions at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in
the southern hemisphere at large heliocentric distances, both during quiet conditions and impacts
of corotating interaction regions observed in the summer of 2016. Methods. We combined multiple
datasets from the Rosetta mission through a multi-instrument analysis to complete the first forward
modelling of FUV emissions in the southern hemisphere of comet 67P and compared modelled brightnesses
to observations with the Alice FUV imaging spectrograph. We modelled the brightness of OI1356,
OI1304, Lyman-$\beta$, CI1657, and CII1335 emissions, which are associated with the dissociation
products of the four major neutral species in the coma: CO$_2$, H$_2$O, CO, and O$_2$. The suprathermal
electron population was probed by RPC/IES and the neutral column density was constrained by several
instruments: ROSINA, MIRO and VIRTIS. Results. The modelled and observed brightnesses of the FUV
emission lines agree closely when viewing nadir and dissociative excitation by electron impact
is shown to be the dominant source of emissions away from perihelion. The CII1335 emissions are shown
to be consistent with the volume mixing ratio of CO derived from ROSINA. When viewing the limb during
the impacts of corotating interaction regions, the model reproduces brightnesses of OI1356 and
CI1657 well, but resonance scattering in the extended coma may contribute significantly to the
observed Lyman-$\beta$ and OI1304 emissions. The correlation between variations in the suprathermal
electron flux and the observed FUV line brightnesses when viewing the comet's limb suggests electrons
are accelerated on large scales and that they originate in the solar wind. This means that the FUV
emissions are auroral in nature.

Micro-bubbles and bubbly flows are widely observed and applied in chemical engineering, medicine,
involves deformation, rupture, and collision of bubbles, phase mixture, etc. We study bubble dynamics
by setting up two numerical simulation cases: bubbly flow with a single bubble and multiple bubbles,
both confined in the microchannel, with parameters corresponding to their medical backgrounds.
Both the cases have their medical background applications. Multiphase flow simulation requires
high computation accuracy due to possible component losses that may be caused by sparse meshing
during the computation. Hence, data-driven methods can be adopted as an useful tool. Based on physics-informed
neural networks (PINNs), we propose a novel deep learning framework BubbleNet, which entails three
main parts: deep neural networks (DNN) with sub nets for predicting different physics fields; the
semi-physics-informed part, with only the fluid continuum condition and the pressure Poisson
equation $\mathcal{P}$ encoded within; the time discretized normalizer (TDN), an algorithm to
normalize field data per time step before training. We apply the traditional DNN and our BubbleNet
to train the coarsened simulation data and predict the physics fields of both the two bubbly flow
cases. The BubbleNets are trained for both with and without $\mathcal{P}$, from which we conclude
that the 'physics-informed' part can serve as inner supervision. Results indicate our framework
can predict the physics fields more accurately, estimating the prediction absolute errors. Our
deep learning predictions outperform traditional numerical methods computed with similar data
density meshing. The proposed network can potentially be applied to many other engineering fields.

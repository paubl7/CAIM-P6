Three different applications of spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) are demonstrated
on large-eddy simulation data of a turbulent jet. SPOD-based low-rank reconstruction can, in principle,
be performed by direct inversion of a truncated SPOD. The spectral inversion of the SPOD problem,
however, is not straight-forward as the algorithm relies on spectral estimation. In this work,
we demonstrate SPOD-based flow field reconstruction using direct inversion in the frequency domain
and propose an alternative approach based on oblique projection in the time domain. While the SPOD
optimally represents the flow in a statistical sense, the time-domain approach seeks an optimal
reconstruction of the instantaneous flow field. As a direct application of low-rank reconstruction,
we propose a SPOD-based denoising strategy that is based on hard-thresholding of the SPOD eigenvalue
spectrum. The proposed strategy achieves significant noise reduction while simultaneously facilitating
drastic data compression. Both reconstruction approaches can be used to investigate intermittent
behavior in turbulent flows in the frequency-time domain. In contrast to standard frequency-time
analysis of time signals, the SPOD-based approach yields a spectrogram that characterizes the
temporal evolution of spatially coherent flow structures. In the frequency-domain, time-varying
expansion coefficients can be obtained by basing the SPOD on a sliding window. This approach, however,
is computationally intractable even for moderately-sized data. To mitigate this limitation,
an alternative strategy based on convolution in the time-domain is proposed. When applied to the
turbulent jet data, SPOD-based frequency-time analysis reveals that the intermittent occurrence
of large-scale coherent structures is directly associated with high-energy events.

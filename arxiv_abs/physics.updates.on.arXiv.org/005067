Microcombs - optical frequency combs generated in microresonators - have advanced tremendously
in the last decade, and are advantageous for applications in frequency metrology, navigation,
spectroscopy, telecommunications, and microwave photonics. Crucially, microcombs offer the
prospect of fully integrated miniaturized optical systems with unprecedented reductions in cost,
size, weight, and power. However, this goal has been consistently hindered by the use of bulk free-space
and fiber-optic components to process microcombs, limiting form factors to the table-top. Here,
we address this challenge by introducing an integrated photonics interposer architecture to process
microcombs and replace discrete components. Taking microcomb-based optical frequency synthesis
in the telecom C-band around 1550 nm as our target application, we develop an interposer architecture
that collects, routes, and interfaces octave-wide optical signals between photonic chiplets
and heterogeneously integrated devices that constitute the synthesizer. We have implemented
the octave spanning spectral filtering of a microcomb, central to the interposer, in the popular
silicon nitride photonic platform, and have confirmed the requisite performance of the individual
elements of the interposer. Moreover, we show that the thick silicon nitride needed for bright dissipative
Kerr soliton generation can be integrated with the comparatively thin silicon nitride interposer
layer through octave-bandwidth adiabatic evanescent coupling, indicating a path towards future
system-level consolidation. Our interposer architecture addresses the immediate need for on-chip
microcomb processing to successfully miniaturize microcomb systems. As microcombs and integrated
devices evolve, our approach can be readily adapted to other metrology-grade applications based
on optical atomic clocks and high-precision navigation and spectroscopy.

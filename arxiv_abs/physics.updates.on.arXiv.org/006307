This study aims at revealing the effect of composition on mechanical and antibacterial properties
of hydroxyapatite/gray Titania coating for biomedical applications. HAp is a bioceramic material
used as a plasma-sprayed coating to promote osseointegra-tion of femoral stems. Biomaterial coatings
are fabricated mostly using atmospheric plasma spray (APS). However, the conventional plasma
spray process requires hydrox-yapatite powder with good flow, and to prepare such free-flowing
powder, agglomer-ation, such as spray drying, fusing, and crushing is used. Therefore, it is impossible
to spray nano-powder using conventional methods. Here, we designed a suspension-feeding system
to feed nanoparticles using a liquid carrier. Suspension plasma spray (SPS) successfully deposited
homogeneous HAp/Gray Titania coating with less poros-ity on the surface of titanium substrates.
The microstructure of coatings with differ-ent compositions was then characterized using scanning
electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy to identify the crystal structure.
All results con-sistently demonstrated that SPS could transform Ti2 O3 into TiO2 with mixed Magneli
phases, such as Ti4 O7 and Ti3 O5, which usually show photocatalytic activity. Interfacial strength,
hardness, young modulus, and fracture toughness were also improved with a high concentration of
TiO2. Antibacterial test for E.Coli under LED light re-vealed that SPSed HAp/Gray Titania coating
could significantly enhance antibacterial properties. The possible underlying mechanism of
enhanced antibacterial properties can be attributed to increased Magneli phases and better bacterial
adhesion caused by hydrophilic properties due to submicron size particles. SPS can fabricate visible
light-responsive antibacterial coating, which can be used for medical devices.

In fluid dynamics, the scaling behaviour of flow length scales is commonly used to infer the governing
force balance of a system. The key to a successful approach is to measure length scales that are representative
of the energy contained in the solution (energetically relevant) and indicative of the established
force balance (dynamically relevant). In numerical simulations of rotating convection and magneto-hydrodynamic
dynamos in spherical shells, it has remained difficult to measure length scales that are both energetically
and dynamically relevant, which has led to conflicting interpretations of the underlying force
balance. By analysing an extensive set of magnetic and non-magnetic models, we focus on two length
scales that achieve both energetic and dynamical relevance. The first one is the peak of the poloidal
kinetic energy spectrum, which we successfully compare to crossover points on spectral representations
of the force balance. In most dynamo models, this result confirms that the dominant length scale
of the system is controlled by a quasi-geostrophic (QG-) MAC (Magneto-Archimedean-Coriolis)
balance. In non-magnetic convection models, the analysis favours a QG-CIA (Coriolis-Inertia-Archimedean)
balance. In dynamo models, we introduce a second energetically relevant length scale associated
with the loss of axial invariance in the flow. We again relate this length scale to a crossover point
in scale-dependent force balance diagrams, which marks the transition between large-scale geostrophy
(the equilibrium of Coriolis and pressure forces) and small-scale magnetostrophy, where the Lorentz
force overtakes the Coriolis force. Scaling analysis of these two energetically and dynamically
relevant length scales suggests that the Earth's dynamo is controlled by a QG-MAC balance at a dominant
scale of about 200 km, while magnetostrophic effects are deferred to scales smaller than 50 km.

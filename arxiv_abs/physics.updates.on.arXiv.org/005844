Recent experimental progress in the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics allows to study the
regime of strong interaction between quantized light and complex matter systems. Due to the coherent
coupling between photons and matter-degrees of freedom, polaritons -- hybrid light-matter quasiparticles
-- emerge, which can significantly influence matter properties and complex processes such as chemical
reactions (strong coupling). In this thesis we propose a way to overcome these problems by reformulating
the coupled electron-photon problem in an exact way in a different, purpose-build Hilbert space,
where no longer electrons and photons are the basic physical entities but the polaritons. Representing
an N-electron-M-mode system by an N-polariton wave function with hybrid Fermi-Bose statistics,
we show explicitly how to turn electronic-structure methods into polaritonic-structure methods
that are accurate from the weak to the strong-coupling regime. We elucidate this paradigmatic shift
by a comprehensive review of light-matter coupling, as well as by highlighting the connection between
different electronic-structure methods and quantum-optical models. This extensive discussion
accentuates that the polariton description is not only a mathematical trick, but it is grounded
in a simple and intuitive physical argument: when the excitations of a system are hybrid entities
a formulation of the theory in terms of these new entities is natural. Finally, we discuss in great
detail how to adopt standard algorithms of electronic-structure methods to adhere to the new hybrid
Fermi-Bose statistics. Guaranteeing the corresponding nonlinear inequality constraints in
practice requires a careful development, implementation and validation of numerical algorithms.
This extra numerical complexity is the price we pay for making the coupled matter-photon problem
feasible for first-principle methods.

The use of wireless implanted medical devices (IMDs) is growing because they facilitate continuous
monitoring of patients during normal activities, simplify medical procedures required for data
retrieval and reduce the likelihood of infection associated with trailing wires. However, most
of the state-of-the-art IMDs are passive and offline devices. One of the key obstacles to an active
and online IMD is the infeasibility of real-time, high-quality video broadcast from the IMD. Such
broadcast would help develop innovative devices such as a video-streaming capsule endoscopy (CE)
pill with therapeutic intervention capabilities. State-of-the-art IMDs employ radio-frequency
electromagnetic waves for information transmission. However, high attenuation of RF-EM waves
in tissues and federal restrictions on the transmit power and operable bandwidth lead to fundamental
performance constraints for IMDs employing RF links, and prevent achieving high data rates that
could accomodate video broadcast. In this work, ultrasonic waves were used for video transmission
and broadcast through biological tissues. The proposed proof-of-concept system was tested on
a porcine intestine ex vivo and a rabbit in vivo. It was demonstrated that using a millimeter-sized,
implanted biocompatible transducer operating at 1.1-1.2 MHz, it was possible to transmit endoscopic
video with high resolution (1280 pixels by 720 pixels) through porcine intestine wrapped with bacon,
and to broadcast standard definition (640 pixels by 480 pixels) video near real-time through rabbit
abdomen in vivo. A media repository that includes experimental demonstrations and media files

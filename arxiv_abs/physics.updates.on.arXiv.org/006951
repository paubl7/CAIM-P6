This paper continues the work of two previous treatments of bunch lengthening by a passive harmonic
cavity in an electron storage ring. Such cavities, intended to reduce the effect of Touschek scattering,
are a feature of fourth generation synchrotron light sources. The charge densities in the equilibrium
state are given by solutions of coupled Ha\"issinski equations, which are nonlinear integral equations.
If the only wake fields are from cavity resonators, the unknowns can be the Fourier transforms of
bunch densities at the resonator frequencies. The solution scheme based on this choice of unknowns
proved to be deficient at the design current when multiple resonators were included. Here we return
to the conventional formulation of Ha\"issinski equations in coordinate space, the unknowns being
charge densities at mesh points on a fine grid. This system would be awkward to solve by the Newton
method used previously, because the Jacobian matrix is very large. Here a new solution is described,
which is both Jacobian-free and much simpler. It is based on an elementary fixed point iteration,
accelerated by Anderson's method. The scheme is notably fast and robust, accommodating even the
case of extreme over-stretching at current far beyond the design value. The Anderson method is promising
for many problems in accelerator theory and beyond, since it is quite simple and can be used to attack
all kinds of nonlinear and linear integral and differential equations. Results are presented for
ALS-U, with updated design parameters. The model includes harmonic and main r.f. cavities, compensation
of beam loading of the main cavity by adjustment of the generator voltage, and a realistic short range
wake field (rather than the broad-band resonator wake invoked previously).

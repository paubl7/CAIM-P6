Superheated perfluorocarbon nanodroplets are emerging ultrasound imaging contrast agents boasting
biocompatible components, unique phase-change dynamics, and therapeutic loading capabilities.
Upon exposure to a sufficiently high intensity pulse of acoustic energy, the nanodroplet perfluorocarbon
core undergoes a liquid-to-gas phase change and becomes an echogenic microbubble, providing ultrasound
contrast. The controllable activation leads to high-contrast images, while the small size of the
nanodroplets promotes longer circulation times and better in-vivo stability. One drawback, however,
is that the nanodroplets can only be vaporized a single time, limiting their versatility. Recently,
we and others have address this issue by using a perfluorohexane core, which has a boiling point above
body temperature. Thus after vaporization, the microbubbles recondense back into their stable
nanodroplets form. Previous work with perfluorohexane nanodroplets relied on optical activation
via pulse laser absorption of an encapsulated dye. This strategy limits the imaging depth and temporal
resolution of the method. In this study we overcome these limitations by demonstrating acoustic
droplet vaporization with 1.1-MHz high intensity focused ultrasound. A short-duration, high-amplitude
pulse of focused ultrasound provides a sufficiently strong peak negative pressure to initiate
vaporization. When using a custom imaging sequence with a high-frequency transducer, the repeated
acoustic activation of perfluorohexane nanodroplets can be visualized in polyacrylamide tissue-mimicking
phantoms. We demonstrate detection of hundreds of vaporization events from individual nanodroplets
with activation thresholds well below the tissue cavitation limit. Overall, this approach has
the potential to result in reliable contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging at clinically relevant
depths.

In this work, we explore the dynamical impacts and observable signatures of two-fluid effects in
the parameter regimes when ion-neutral collisions do not fully couple the neutral and charged fluids.
The purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the RTI and the effects of the partial ionization
on the development of RTI using non-linear two-fluid numerical simulations. Our two-fluid model
takes into account neutral viscosity, thermal conductivity, and collisional interaction between
neutrals and charges: ionization/recombination, energy and momentum transfer, and frictional
heating. In this paper II, the sensitivity of the RTI dynamics to collisional effects for different
magnetic field configurations supporting the prominence thread is explored. This is done by artificially
varying, or eliminating, effects of both elastic and inelastic collisions by modifying the model
equations. We find that ionization and recombination reactions between ionized and neutral fluids,
if in equilibrium prior to the onset of the instability, do not substantially impact the development
of the primary RTI. However, such reactions can impact development of secondary structures during
mixing of the cold prominence and hotter surrounding coronal material. We find that collisionality
within and between ionized and neutral particle populations play an important role in both linear
and non-linear development of RTI, with ion-neutral collision frequency as the primary determining
factor in development or damping of small scale structures. We also observe that degree and signatures
of flow decoupling between ion and neutral fluids can depend both on the inter-particle collisionality
and the magnetic field configuration of the prominence thread.

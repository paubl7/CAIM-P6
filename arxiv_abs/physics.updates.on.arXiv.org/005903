Fluid, heat and species transport and oxygen reduction in the cathode of a PEM fuel cell are simulated
using multi relaxation lattice Boltzmann method. Heat generation due to oxygen reduction and its
effects on transport and reaction are considered. Simulations for various cell operating voltages,
temperatures and flow rates with various values of porous media properties, namely, permeability,
porosity, and effective porous media diffusion coefficient, are performed to study transport
and operating characteristics in the electrode. It is seen that maximum output power density achievable
is limited by the mass transport rate. A small increase in current density is obtained by increasing
the operating temperature. However, this results in an increase in the rate of heat generation.
Permeability and porosity of the gas diffusion layer do not show a significant impact on the performance
in the range of values presently simulated. Higher permeability, in turn, resulted in enhancement
of thermal gradients in the porous layer. A significant increase in the maximum current density
obtainable is observed with increase in flow rates. The higher convection associated with high
flow rate facilitates better transport of species and heat at the catalyst layer resulting in larger
current density with a lesser chance of hotspot formation. Increased species diffusion coefficient
also resulted in increasing the power output substantially. In addition, the fuel utilization
is also improved at high diffusion rates in the porous media. The study analyses and shows the impact
of various operating and material parameters affecting the performance of a PEM fuel cell with special
attention on enhancing the maximum power density attainable.

The paper is concerned with comparative analysis of differential and integral formulations for
boundary value problems in nonlocal elasticity. For the sake of simplicity, the focus is on an antiplane
problem for a half-space for an exponential kernel. First, a surface loading in the form of a travelling
harmonic wave is studied. This provides a counter-example, revealing that within the framework
of Eringen's theory the solution to the differential model does not satisfy the equation of motion
in nonlocal stresses underlying the related integral formulation. A more general differential
setup, starting from singularly perturbed equations expressing the local stresses through the
nonlocal ones, is then investigated. It is emphasized that the transformation of the original integral
formulation to the differential one in question is only possible provided that two additional conditions
on nonlocal stresses hold on the surface. As a result, the formulated problem subject to three boundary
conditions appears to be ill-posed. Next, the asymptotic solution of the singularly perturbed
problem, subject to a prescribed stress on the boundary, together with only one of the aforementioned
extra conditions, is obtained at a small internal size. Three-term expansion is obtained, leading
to a boundary value problem in local stresses over interior domain. The associated differential
equations are identical to those proposed by Eringen, however, the derived effective boundary
condition incorporates the effect of a nonlocal boundary layer which has previously been ignored.
Moreover, the calculated nonlocal correction to the classical antiplane problem for an elastic
half-space, coming from the boundary conditions is by order of magnitude greater than that appearing
in the equations of motion. Finally, it is shown that the proposed effective condition supports
an antiplane surface wave.

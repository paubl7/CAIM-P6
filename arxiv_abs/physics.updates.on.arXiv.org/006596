The motivation of this work is to produce an integrated formulation for material response due to
detonation wave loading. Here, we focus on elastoplastic structural response. In particular,
we are interested to capture miscible and immiscible behaviour within condensed-phase explosives
arising from the co-existence of a reactive carrier mixture of miscible materials, and several
material interfaces due to the presence of immiscible impurities such as particles or cavities.
The dynamic and thermodynamic evolution of the explosive is communicated to one or more inert confiners
through their shared interfaces, which may undergo severe topological change. We also wish to consider
elastic and plastic structural response of the confiners, rather than make a hydrodynamic assumption
for their behaviour. Previous work by these authors has met these requirements by means of the simultaneous
solution of appropriate systems of equations for the behaviour of the condensed-phase explosive
and the elastoplastic behaviour of the confiners. In the present work, we employ a single system
of partial differential equations (PDEs) proposed by Peshkov and Romenski, which is able to account
for different states of matter by means of generalising the concept of distortion tensors beyond
solids. We amalgamate that formulation with a single system of PDEs which meets the requirement
of co-existing miscible and immiscible explosive mixtures. We present the mathematical derivation
and construct appropriate algorithms for its solution. The resulting model is validated against
exact solutions for several use-cases, including mechanically- and thermally-induced, inviscid
and viscous detonations. Results indicate that the model can accurately simulate a very broad range
of problems involving the nonlinear interaction between reactive and inert materials within a
single framework.

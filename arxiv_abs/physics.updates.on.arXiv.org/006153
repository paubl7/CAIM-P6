A CFD-driven deterministic symbolic identification algorithm for learning explicit algebraic
Reynolds-stress models (EARSM) from high-fidelity data is developed building on the CFD-free
SpaRTA algorithm of [1]. Corrections for the Reynolds stress tensor and the production of transported
turbulent quantities of a baseline linear eddy viscosity model (LEVM) are expressed as functions
of tensor polynomials selected from a library of candidate functions. The CFD-driven training
consists in solving a blackbox optimization problem in which the fitness of candidate EARSM models
is evaluated by running RANS simulations. A preliminary sensitivity analysis is used to identify
the most influential terms and to reduce the dimensionality of the search space and the Constrained
Optimization using Response Surface (CORS) algorithm, which approximates the black-box cost
function using a response surface constructed from a limited number of CFD solves, is used to find
the optimal model parameters within a realizable search space. The resulting turbulence models
are numerically robust and ensure conservation of mean kinetic energy. Furthermore, the CFD-driven
procedure enables training of models against any target quantity of interest computable as an output
of the CFD model. Model discovery and cross-validation is performed for three configurations of
2D turbulent separated flows in channels of variable section using different sets of training data
to show the flexibility of the method. The discovered models are then applied to the prediction of
an unseen 2D separated flow with higher Reynolds number and different geometry. The predictions
of the discovered models for the new case are shown to be not only more accurate of the baseline LEVM,
but also of a multi-purpose EARSM model derived from purely physical arguments.

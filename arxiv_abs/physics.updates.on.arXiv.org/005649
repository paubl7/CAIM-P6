Beam quality optimization in mammography traditionally considers detection of a target obscured
by quantum noise on a homogenous background. It can be argued that this scheme does not correspond
well to the clinical imaging task because real mammographic images contain a complex superposition
of anatomical structures, resulting in anatomical noise that may dominate over quantum noise.
Using a newly developed spectral mammography system, we measured the correlation and magnitude
of the anatomical noise in a set of mammograms. The results from these measurements were used as input
to an observer-model optimization that included quantum noise as well as anatomical noise. We found
that, within this framework, the detectability of tumors and microcalcifications behaved very
differently with respect to beam quality and dose. The results for small microcalcifications were
similar to what traditional optimization methods would yield, which is to be expected since quantum
noise dominates over anatomical noise at high spatial frequencies. For larger tumors, however,
low-frequency anatomical noise was the limiting factor. Because anatomical structure has similar
energy dependence as tumor contrast, optimal x-ray energy was significantly higher and the useful
energy region wider than traditional methods suggest. Measurements on a tissue phantom confirmed
these theoretical results. Furthermore, since quantum noise constitutes only a small fraction
of the noise, the dose could be reduced substantially without sacrificing tumor detectability.
Exposure settings used clinically are therefore not necessarily optimal for this imaging task.
The impact of these findings on the mammographic imaging task as a whole is, however, at this stage
unclear.

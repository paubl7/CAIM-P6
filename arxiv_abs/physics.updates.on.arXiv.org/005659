The Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model is one of the standard
models of disease spreading. Here we analyse an extended SEIR model that accounts for asymptomatic
carriers, believed to play an important role in COVID-19 transmission. For this model we derive
a number of analytic results for important quantities such as the peak number of infections, the
time taken to reach the peak and the size of the final affected population. We also propose an accurate
way of specifying initial conditions for the numerics (from insufficient data) using the fact that
the early time exponential growth is well-described by the dominant eigenvector of the linearized
equations. Secondly we explore the effect of different intervention strategies such as social
distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try
to reduce the disease reproductive number, $R_0$, to a target value $R^{\rm target}_0 < 1$, but in
distinct ways, which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same $R^{\rm target}_0
< 1$, TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it
has to be based on contact tracing and our study quantifies the required ratio of tests-per-day to
the number of new cases-per-day. Our analysis shows that the largest eigenvalue of the linearised
dynamics provides a simple understanding of the disease progression, both pre- and post- intervention,
and explains observed data for many countries. We apply our results to the COVID data for India to
obtain heuristic projections for the course of the pandemic, and note that the predictions strongly
depend on the assumed fraction of asymptomatic carriers.

The objective of this study is to examine spatial patterns of impacts and recovery of communities
based on variances in credit card transactions. Such variances could capture the collective effects
of household impacts, disrupted accesses, and business closures, and thus provide an integrative
measure for examining disaster impacts and community recovery in disasters. Existing studies
depend mainly on survey and sociodemographic data for disaster impacts and recovery effort evaluations,
although such data has limitations, including large data collection efforts and delayed timeliness
results. In addition, there are very few studies have concentrated on spatial patterns and disparities
of disaster impacts and short-term recovery of communities, although such investigation can enhance
situational awareness during disasters and support the identification of disparate spatial patterns
of disaster impacts and recovery in the impacted regions. This study examines credit card transaction
data Harris County (Texas, USA) during Hurricane Harvey in 2017 to explore spatial patterns of disaster
impacts and recovery during from the perspective of community residents and businesses at ZIP code
and county scales, respectively, and to further investigate their spatial disparities across
ZIP codes. The results indicate that individuals in ZIP codes with populations of higher income
experienced more severe disaster impact and recovered more quickly than those located in lower-income
ZIP codes for most business sectors. Our findings not only enhance the understanding of spatial
patterns and disparities in disaster impacts and recovery for better community resilience assessment,
but also could benefit emergency managers, city planners, and public officials in harnessing population
activity data, using credit card transactions as a proxy for activity, to improve situational awareness
and resource allocation.

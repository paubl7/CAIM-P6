In dual-energy computed tomography (DECT), low- and high- kVp data are collected often over a full-angular
range (FAR) of $360^\circ$. While there exists strong interest in DECT with low- and high-kVp data
acquired over limited-angular ranges (LARs), there remains little investigation of image reconstruction
in DECT with LAR data. Objective: We investigate image reconstruction with minimized LAR artifacts
from low- and high-kVp data over LARs of $\le 180^\circ$ by using a directional-total-variation
(DTV) algorithm. Methods: Image reconstruction from LAR data is formulated as a convex optimization
problem in which data-$\ell_2$ is minimized with constraints on image's DTVs along orthogonal
axes. We then achieve image reconstruction by applying the DTV algorithm to solve the optimization
problem. We conduct numerical studies from data generated over arcs of LARs, ranging from $14^\circ$
to $180^\circ$, and perform visual inspection and quantitative analysis of images reconstructed.
Results: Monochromatic images of interest obtained with the DTV algorithm from LAR data show substantially
reduced artifacts that are observed often in images obtained with existing algorithms. The improved
image quality also leads to accurate estimation of physical quantities of interest, such as effective
atomic number and iodine-contrast concentration. Conclusion: Our study reveals that from LAR
data of low- and high-kVp, monochromatic images can be obtained that are visually, and physical
quantities can be estimated that are quantitatively, comparable to those obtained in FAR DECT.
Significance: As LAR DECT is of high practical application interest, the results acquired in the
work may engender insights into the design of DECT with LAR scanning configurations of practical
application significance.

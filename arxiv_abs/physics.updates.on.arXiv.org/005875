Understanding attention dynamics on social media during pandemics could help governments minimize
the effects. We focus on how COVID-19 has influenced the attention dynamics on the biggest Chinese
microblogging website Sina Weibo during the first four months of the pandemic. We study the real-time
Hot Search List (HSL), which provides the ranking of the most popular 50 hashtags based on the amount
of Sina Weibo searches. We show how the specific events, measures and developments during the epidemic
affected the emergence of different kinds of hashtags and the ranking on the HSL. A significant increase
of COVID-19 related hashtags started to occur on HSL around January 20, 2020, when the transmission
of the disease between humans was announced. Then very rapidly a situation was reached where COVID-related
hashtags occupied 30-70% of the HSL, however, with changing content. We give an analysis of how the
hashtag topics changed during the investigated time span and conclude that there are three periods
separated by February 12 and March 12. In period 1, we see strong topical correlations and clustering
of hashtags; in period 2, the correlations are weakened, without clustering pattern; in period
3, we see a potential of clustering while not as strong as in period 1. We further explore the dynamics
of HSL by measuring the ranking dynamics and the lifetimes of hashtags on the list. This way we can
obtain information about the decay of attention, which is important for decisions about the temporal
placement of governmental measures to achieve permanent awareness. Furthermore, our observations
indicate abnormally higher rank diversity in the top 15 ranks on HSL due to the COVID-19 related hashtags,
revealing the possibility of algorithmic intervention from the platform provider.

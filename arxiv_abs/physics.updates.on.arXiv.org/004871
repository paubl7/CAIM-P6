Electrodynamics is usually written with a polarization vector field to describe the response of
matter to electric fields, or more specifically, to describe changes in distribution of charge
as an electric field is changed. This approach does not allow unique specification of a polarization
field from measurements of electric and magnetic fields. Many polarization fields produce the
same electric and magnetic fields, because only the divergence of the polarization enters Maxwell's
first equation, relating charge and electric field. The curl of any function can be added to a polarization
field without changing the electric field at all. The divergence of the curl is always zero. Models
of structures that produce polarization cannot be uniquely determined from electrical measurements
for the same reason. Models must describe charge distribution not just distribution of polarization
to be unique. I propose a different paradigm to describe field dependent charge, i.e., to describe
the phenomena of polarization. I propose an operational definition of polarization that has worked
well in biophysics where a field dependent, time dependent polarization provides the gating current
that makes neuronal sodium and potassium channels respond to voltage. The operational definition
has been applied successfully to experiments for nearly fifty years. Estimates of polarization
have been computed from simulations, models, and theories using this definition and they fit experimental
data quite well. I propose that the same operational definition be used to define polarization charge
in experiments, models, computations, theories, and simulations of other systems. Charge movement
needs to be computed from a combination of electrodynamics and mechanics because 'everything interacts
with everything else'. The classical polarization field need not enter into that treatment at all.

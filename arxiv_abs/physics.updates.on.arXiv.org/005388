We explore definite theoretical assertions about consciousness, starting from a non-reductive
psycho-informational solution of David Chalmers's 'hard problem', based on the hypothesis that
a fundamental property of 'information' is its experience by the supporting 'system'. The kind
of information involved in consciousness needs to be quantum for multiple reasons, including its
intrinsic privacy and its power of building up thoughts by entangling qualia states. As a result
we reach a quantum-information-based panpsychism, with classical physics supervening on quantum
physics, quantum physics supervening on quantum information, and quantum information supervening
on consciousness. We then argue that the internally experienced quantum state, since it corresponds
to a definite experience-not to a random choice-must be pure, and we call it ontic, in contrast with
the state predictable from the outside (i.e. the state describing the knowledge of the experience
from the point of view of an external observer) which we call epistemic and is generally mixed. Purity
of the ontic state requires an evolution that is purity preserving, namely a so-called 'atomic'
quantum operation. The latter is generally probabilistic, and its particular outcome is interpreted
as the free will, which is unpredictable even in principle since quantum probability cannot be interpreted
as lack of knowledge. The same purity of state and evolution allows solving the 'combination problem'
of panpsychism. Quantum state evolution accounts for a short-term buffer of experience and contains
itself quantum-to-classical and classical-to-quantum information transfers. Long term memory,
on the other hand, is classical, and needs memorization and recall processes that are quantum-to-classical
and classical-to-quantum, respectively...

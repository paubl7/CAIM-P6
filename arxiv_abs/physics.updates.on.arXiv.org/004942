Due to its wide reaching implications for everything from identifying hotspots of income inequality
to political redistricting, there is a rich body of literature across the sciences quantifying
spatial patterns in socioeconomic data. In particular, the variability of indicators relevant
to social and economic well-being between localized populations is of great interest, as it pertains
to the spatial manifestations of inequality and segregation. However, heterogeneity in population
density, sensitivity of statistical analyses to spatial aggregation, and the importance of pre-drawn
political boundaries for policy intervention may decrease the efficacy and relevance of existing
methods for analyzing spatial socioeconomic data. Additionally, these measures commonly lack
either a framework for comparing results for qualitative and quantitative data on the same scale,
or a mechanism for generalization to multi-region correlations. To mitigate these issues associated
with traditional spatial measures, here we view local deviations in socioeconomic variables from
a topological lens rather than a spatial one, and use a novel information theoretic network approach
based on the Generalized Jensen Shannon Divergence to distinguish distributional quantities
across adjacent regions. We apply our methodology in a series of experiments to study the network
of neighboring census tracts in the continental US, quantifying the decay in two-point distributional
correlations across the network, examining the county-level socioeconomic disparities induced
from the aggregation of tracts, and constructing an algorithm for the division of a city into homogeneous
clusters. These results provide a new framework for analyzing the variation of attributes across
regional populations, and shed light on new, universal patterns in socioeconomic attributes.

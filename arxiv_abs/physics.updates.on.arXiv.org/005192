We have assessed the accuracy for magnetic properties of a set of 51 density functionals, including
both recently published as well as already established functionals. The accuracy assessment is
done for a series of 27 small molecules and is based on comparing the predicted magnetizabilities
to literature reference values calculated using coupled cluster theory with full singles and doubles
and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] employing large basis sets. The most accurate magnetizabilities,
defined as the smallest mean absolute error, were obtained with the BHandHLYP functional. Three
of the six studied Berkeley functionals and the three range-separated Florida functionals also
yield accurate magnetizabilities. Also other older functionals like CAM-B3LYP, KT1, BHLYP (BHandH),
B3LYP and PBE0 perform rather well. In contrast, unsatisfactory performance was generally obtained
with Minnesota functionals, which are therefore not recommended for calculations of magnetically
induced current densities and related magnetic properties such as magnetizabilities and nuclear
magnetic shieldings. In addition, we demonstrate that magnetizabilities can be calculated by
numerical integration of the Biot-Savart expression, which has been implemented as a new feature
in the gauge including magnetically induced current method (GIMIC). Thus, numerically calculated
magnetizabilities that are based on current densities can be obtained for new functionals in an
elegant manner, even when analytical approaches to obtain them as the second derivative of the energy
have not been implemented. In addition, calculations of spatial magnetizability functions allow
their visualization and spatial decomposition, which provides additional information that is
not otherwise easily accessible.

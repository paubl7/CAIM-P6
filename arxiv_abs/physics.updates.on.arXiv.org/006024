Understanding turbulent transport physics in the tokamak edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) is critical
to developing a successful fusion reactor. The dynamics in these regions plays a key role in achieving
high fusion performance by determining the edge pedestal that suppresses turbulence in H-mode.
Additionally, the survivability of a reactor is set by the heat load to the vessel walls, making it
important to understand turbulent spreading of heat as it flows along open magnetic field lines
in the SOL. Large-amplitude fluctuations, magnetic X-point geometry, and plasma interactions
with material walls make simulating turbulence in the edge/SOL more challenging than in the core
region, necessitating specialized gyrokinetic codes. Further, the inclusion of electromagnetic
effects in gyrokinetic simulations that can handle the unique challenges of the boundary plasma
is critical to the understanding of phenomena such as the pedestal and ELMs, for which electromagnetic
dynamics are expected to be important. In this thesis, we develop the first capability to simulate
electromagnetic gyrokinetic turbulence on open magnetic field lines. This is an important step
towards comprehensive electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations of the coupled edge/SOL system.
By using a continuum full-f approach via an energy-conserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization
scheme that avoids the Ampere cancellation problem, we show that electromagnetic fluctuations
can be handled in a robust, stable, and efficient manner in the gyrokinetic module of the Gkeyll code.
We then present results which roughly model the scrape-off layer of the National Spherical Torus
Experiment (NSTX), and show that electromagnetic effects can affect blob dynamics and transport.
We also formulate the gyrokinetic system in field-aligned coordinates for modeling realistic
edge and scrape-off layer geometries in experiments.

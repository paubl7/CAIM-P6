Functionalised metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been proposed as promising radiosensitising agents
for more efficient radiotherapy treatment using photons and ion beams. Radiosensitising properties
of NPs may depend on many different parameters (such as size, composition and density) of the metal
core, organic coatings and the molecular environment. A systematic exploration of each of these
parameters on the atomistic level remains a formidable experimental task but it can be addressed
by means of advanced computational modelling. This paper presents a detailed computational protocol
for the construction and atomistic-level characterisation of radiosensitising metal NPs in explicit
molecular media. The protocol is general and extensible to many different combinations of the core,
coating and environment. As an experimentally relevant case study we consider gold nanoparticles
coated with thiol-poly(ethylene glycol)-amine molecules of different length and surface density
and solvated in water at ambient conditions. Radial distribution of different atoms in the coatings
as well as distribution and structural properties of water around the coated NPs are analysed and
linked to radiosensitising properties of the NPs. It is revealed that structure of the coating layer
of the solvated NPs depends strongly on the surface density of ligands. At surface densities below
3 molecules per nm$^{2}$ the coating represents a mixture of different conformation states, whereas
elongated "brush"-like structures are formed predominantly at higher densities of ligands. The
water content in denser coatings is significantly lowered at distances from 1 nm up to 3 nm from the
gold surface depending on the length of ligand molecules. Dense and thick coatings may suppress
the production of hydroxyl radicals by low-energy electrons emitted from the metal NPs and thus
diminish their radiosensitising properties.

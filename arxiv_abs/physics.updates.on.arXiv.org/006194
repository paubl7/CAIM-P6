The multi-scale flow mechanism is crucial for force and heat loaded on near-space and reentry vehicles,
the control of spacecraft by thrusters, the propelling and cooling of MEMS, etc. Since the continuum
flow and rarefied flow often exist simultaneously, the modeling and prediction for such a multi-scale
flow field is very complicated. One important and efficient way of predicting the multi-scale flow
is constructing numerical methods by adapting the multi-scale properties of the temporal integral
solutions (or equivalent characteristic line solutions) for the model equations in the gas-kinetic
theory. The model equations can be classified into FP-type and BGK-type, and the numerical methods
can have deterministic form or stochastic particle form. Since these numerical methods are strictly
based on model equations, they are also restricted by the model equations. The difficulty and complexity
in constructing model equation that has complete asymptotic preserving property for gas mixture
with non-equilibrium internal energy will prevent the further extension of these methods. Therefore,
this paper addresses the question whether a multi-scale numerical method can be established not
on the model equations, but directly adapts the relaxation rates of macroscopic variables such
as stress and heat flux. Since the algorithm of multi-scale particle method based on BGK-type equation
is clear and simple, its collision step is modified in this work, where the macroscopic variables
firstly evolve according to their relaxation rates, and then the molecules that participate in
inter-molecular collisions get their after-collision velocities from the after-evolution macroscopic
variables. Therefore, this direct relaxation process does not depend on the model equations anymore.
Finally, the validity and accuracy of the particle method with direct relaxation process are examined
with five test cases.

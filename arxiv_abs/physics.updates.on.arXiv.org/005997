We applied a hybrid-dimensional flow model to pressure transients recorded during pumping experiments
conducted at the Reiche Zeche underground research laboratory to study the normal opening behavior
of fractures due to fluid injection. Two distinct types of pressure responses to flow-rate steps
were identified and numerically modelled using a radial-symmetric flow formulation for a fracture
that comprises a non-linear constitutive relation for the contact mechanics governing reversible
fracture surface interaction. These two groups represent radial-symmetric and plane-axisymmetric
flow regimes from a conventional pressure-diffusion perspective. A comprehensive parameter
study into the sensitivity of the applied hydro-mechanical model to changes in characteristic
fracture parameters revealed an interrelation between fracture length and normal fracture stiffness
that yield a match between field observations and numerical results. Fracture stiffness values
increase with corresponding fracture length. Decomposition of the acting normal stresses into
a stresses associated with the deformation state of the global fracture geometry and the contact
stresses indicates that geometrically induced stresses contribute the more the lower the total
effective normal stress and the shorter the fracture. Separating the contributions of the local
contact mechanics and the overall fracture geometry to fracture normal stiffness indicates that
the latter, the geometrical stiffness, constitutes a lower bound for total stiffness; its relevance
increases with decreasing fracture length, too. Our study demonstrates that non-linear hydro-mechanical
coupling can lead to vastly different hydraulic responses and thus provides an alternative to conventional
pressure-diffusion analysis that requires changes in flow regime to cover the full range of observations.

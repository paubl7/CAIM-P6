Recently, the multilevel diffractive lenses (MDLs) have attracted considerable attention mainly
due to their superior wave focusing performance; however, efforts to correct the chromatic aberration
are still in progress. Here, we demonstrate the numerical design and experimental demonstration
of high-numerical aperture (NA) (${\sim}0.99$), diffraction-limited achromatic multilevel
diffractive lens (AMDL) operating in microwave range $10 GHz$ - $14 GHz$. A multi-objective differential
evolution (MO-DE) algorithm is incorporated with the three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain
(3D FDTD) method to optimize both the heights and widths of each concentric ring (zone) of the AMDL
structure. In this study, the desired focal distance ${\Delta}F_d$ is treated as an optimization
parameter in addition to the structural parameters of the zones for the first time. In other words,
MO-DE diminishes the necessity of predetermined focal distance and center wavelength by also providing
an alternative method for phase profile tailoring. The proposed AMDL can be considered as an ultra-compact,
the radius is $3.7{\lambda_c}$ where ${\lambda_c}$ is the center wavelength (i.e., $12 GHz$ frequency),
and flat lens which has a thickness of ${\lambda_c}$. The numerically calculated full-width at
half-maximum (FWHM) values are below $0.554{\lambda}$ and focusing efficiency values are varying
between $28{\%}$ and $45.5{\%}$. To experimentally demonstrate the functionality of the optimized
lens, the AMDL composing of polylactic acid material (PLA) polymer is fabricated via 3D-printing
technology. The numerical and experimental results are compared, discussed in detail and a good
agreement between them is observed. Moreover, the verified AMDL in microwave regime is scaled down
to the visible wavelengths to observe achromatic and diffraction-limited focusing behavior between
$380 nm$ - $620 nm$ wavelengths.

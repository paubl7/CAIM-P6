The Mediterranean is strongly affected by Extreme Precipitation Events (EPEs), sometimes leading
to negative impacts on society, economy, and the environment. Understanding such natural hazards
and their drivers is essential to mitigate related risks. Here, EPEs over the Mediterranean between
1979 and 2019 are analyzed, using ERA5 dataset from ECMWF. EPEs are determined based on the 99th percentile
of the daily distribution (P99). The different EPE characteristics are assessed, based on seasonality
and spatiotemporal dependencies. To better understand the connection to large-scale atmospheric
flow patterns, Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis and subsequent K-means clustering
are used to quantify the importance of weather regimes to EPE frequency. The analysis is performed
for three different variables, depicting atmospheric variability in the lower and middle troposphere:
Sea level pressure (SLP), temperature at 850 hPa (T850), and geopotential height at 500 hPa (Z500).
Results show a clear spatial division in EPEs occurrence, with winter (autumn) being the season
of highest EPEs frequency for the eastern (western) Mediterranean. There is a high degree of temporal
dependencies with 20% of the EPEs (median value of all studied grid-cells), occurring up to 1 week
after a preceding P99 event at the same location. Local orography is a key modulator of the spatiotemporal
connections and substantially enhances the probability of co-occurrence of EPEs even for distant
locations. The clustering clearly demonstrates the prevalence of distinct synoptic-scale atmospheric
conditions during the occurrence of EPEs for different locations within the region. Results indicate
that clustering based on a combination of SLP and Z500 can increase the conditional probability
of EPEs by more than three (3) times (median value for all grid cells) from the nominal probability
of 1% for the P99 EPEs.

Pixelated silicon detectors are state-of-the-art technology to achieve precise tracking and
vertexing at collider experiments, designed to accurately measure the hit position of incoming
particles in high rate and radiation environments. The detector requirements become extremely
demanding for operation at the High-Luminosity LHC, where up to 200 interactions will overlap in
the same bunch crossing on top of the process of interest. Additionally, fluences up to 2.3 10^16
cm^-2 1 MeV neutron equivalent at 3.0 cm distance from the beam are expected for an integrated luminosity
of 3000 fb^-1. In the last decades, the pixel pitch has constantly been reduced to cope with the experiment's
needs of achieving higher position resolution and maintaining low pixel occupancy per channel.
The spatial resolution improves with a decreased pixel size but it degrades with radiation damage.
Therefore, prototype sensor modules for the upgrade of the experiments at the HL-LHC need to be tested
after being irradiated. This paper describes position resolution measurements on planar prototype
sensors with 100x25 um^2 pixels for the CMS Phase-2 Upgrade. It reviews the dependence of the position
resolution on the relative inclination angle between the incoming particle trajectory and the
sensor, the charge threshold applied by the readout chip, and the bias voltage. A precision setup
with three parallel planes of sensors has been used to investigate the performance of sensors irradiated
to fluences up to F_eq = 3.6 10^15 cm-2. The measurements were performed with a 5 GeV electron beam.
A spatial resolution of 3.2 +\- 0.1 um is found for non-irradiated sensors, at the optimal angle for
charge sharing. The resolution is 5.0 +/- 0.2 um for a proton-irradiated sensor at F_eq = 2.1 10^15
cm-2 and a neutron-irradiated sensor at F_eq = 3.6 10^15 cm^-2.

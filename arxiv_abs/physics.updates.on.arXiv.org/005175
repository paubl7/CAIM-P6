Upcoming tokamak experiments fueled with deuterium and tritium are expected to have large alpha
particle populations. Such experiments motivate new attention to the theory of alpha particle
confinement and transport. A key topic is the interaction of alphas with perturbations to the tokamak
fields, including those from ripple and magnetohydrodynamic modes like Alfv\'{e}n eigenmodes.
These perturbations can transport alphas, leading to changed localization of alpha heating, loss
of alpha power, and damage to device walls. Alpha interaction with these perturbations is often
studied with single particle theory. In contrast, we derive a drift kinetic theory to calculate
the alpha heat flux resulting from arbitrary perturbation frequency and periodicity (provided
these can be studied drift kinetically). Novel features of the theory include the retention of a
large effective collision frequency resulting from the resonant alpha collisional boundary layer,
correlated interactions over many poloidal transits, and finite orbit effects. Heat fluxes are
considered for the example cases of ripple and the toroidal Alfv\'{e}n eigenmode (TAE). The ripple
heat flux is small. The TAE heat flux is significant and scales with the square of the perturbation
amplitude, allowing the derivation of constraints on mode amplitude for avoidance of significant
alpha depletion. A simple saturation condition suggests that TAEs in one upcoming experiment will
not cause significant alpha transport via the mechanisms in this theory. However, saturation above
the level suggested by the simple condition, but within numerical and experimental experience,
which could be accompanied by the onset of stochasticity, could cause significant transport.

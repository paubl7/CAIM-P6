Understanding the differences between photon-induced and plasmon-induced hot electrons is essential
for the construction of devices for plasmonic energy conversion. The mechanism of the plasmonic
enhancement in photochemistry, photocatalysis, and light-harvesting and especially the role
of hot carriers is still heavily discussed. The question remains, if plasmon-induced and photon-induced
hot carriers are fundamentally different, or if plasmonic enhancement is only an effect of field
concentration producing these carriers in greater numbers. For the bulk plasmon resonance, a fundamental
difference is known, yet for the technologically important surface plasmons this is far from being
settled. The direct imaging of surface plasmon-induced hot carriers could provide essential insight,
but the separation of the influence of driving laser, field-enhancement, and fundamental plasmon
decay has proven to be difficult. Here, we present an approach using a two-color femtosecond pump-probe
scheme in time-resolved 2-photon-photoemission (tr-2PPE), supported by a theoretical analysis
of the light and plasmon energy flow. We separate the energy and momentum distribution of the plasmon-induced
hot electrons from the one of photoexcited electrons by following the spatial evolution of photoemitted
electrons with energy-resolved Photoemission Electron Microscopy (PEEM) and Momentum Microscopy
during the propagation of a Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) pulse along a gold surface. With this
scheme, we realize a direct experimental access to plasmon-induced hot electrons. We find a plasmonic
enhancement towards high excitation energies and small in-plane momenta, which suggests a fundamentally
different mechanism of hot electron generation, as previously unknown for surface plasmons.

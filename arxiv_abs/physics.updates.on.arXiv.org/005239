In traditional cochlear implant surgery, physical trauma may occur during electrode array insertion.
Magnetic guidance of the electrode array has been proposed to mitigate this medical complication.
After insertion, the guiding magnet attached to the tip of the electrode array must be detached via
a heating process and removed. This heating process may, however, cause thermal trauma within the
cochlea. In this study, a validated three-dimensional finite element heat transfer model of the
human cochlea is applied to perform an intracochlear thermal analysis necessary to ensure the safety
of the magnet removal phase. Specifically, the maximum safe input power density to detach the magnet
is determined as a function of the boundary conditions, heating duration, cochlea size, implant
electrode array radius and insertion depth, magnet size, and cochlear fluid. A dimensional analysis
and numerical simulations reveal that the maximum safe input power density increases with increasing
cochlea size and the radius of the electrode array, whereas it decreases with increasing electrode
array insertion depth and magnet size. The best cochlear fluids from the thermal perspective are
perilymph and a soap solution. Even for the worst case scenario in which the cochlear walls are assumed
to be adiabatic except at the round window, the maximum safe input power density is larger than that
required to melt 1 $\rm{mm^3}$ of paraffin bonding the magnet to the implant electrode array. By
combining the outcome of this work with other aspects of the design of the magnetic insertion process,
namely the magnetic guidance procedure and medical requirements, it will be possible to implement
a thermally safe patient-specific surgical procedure.

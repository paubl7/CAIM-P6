The knuckleball is perhaps the most enigmatic pitch in baseball. Relying on the presence of raised
seams on the surface of the ball to create asymmetric flow, a knuckleball's trajectory has proven
very challenging to predict compared to other baseball pitches, such as fastballs or curveballs.
Previous experimental tracking of large numbers of knuckleballs has shown that they can move in
essentially any direction relative to what would be expected from a drag-only trajectory. This
has led to speculation that knuckleballs exhibit chaotic motion. Here we develop a relatively simple
model of a knuckleball that includes quadratic drag and lift from asymmetric flow which is taken
from experimental measurements of slowly rotating baseballs. Our models can indeed exhibit dynamical
chaos as long In contrast, models that omit torques on the ball in flight do not show chaotic behavior.
Uncertainties in the phase space position of the knuckleball are shown to grow by factors as large
as $10^6$ over the flight of the ball from the pitcher to home plate. We quantify the impact of our model
parameters on the chaos realized in our models, specifically showing that maximum Lyapunov exponent
is roughly proportional to the square root of the effective lever arm of the torque, and also roughly
proportional to the initial velocity of the pitch. We demonstrate the existence of bifurcations
that can produce changes in the location of the ball when it reaches the plate of as much as 1.2 m for
specific initial conditions similar to those used by professional knuckleball pitchers. As we
introduce additional complexity in the form of more faithful representations of the empirical
asymmetry force measurements, we find that a larger fraction of the possible initial conditions
result in dynamical chaos.

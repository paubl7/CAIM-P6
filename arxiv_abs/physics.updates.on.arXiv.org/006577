Commercially available low-cost particulate matter (PM) sensors provide output as total or size-specific
particle counts and mass concentrations. These quantities are not measured directly but are estimated
by the original equipment manufacturers' (OEM) proprietary algorithms and have inherent limitations
since particle scattering depends on their composition, size, shape, and complex index of refraction
(CRI). Hence, there is a need to characterize and calibrate their performance under a controlled
environment. We present calibration algorithms for Plantower PMS A003 sensor as a function of particle
size and concentration. A standardized experimental protocol was used to control the PM level,
environmental conditions and to evaluate sensor-to-sensor reproducibility. The calibration
was based on tests when PMS A003 were exposed to different polydisperse standardized testing aerosols.
The results suggested particle size distribution from PMS A003 was shifted compared to reference
instrument measures. For calibration of number concentration, linear model without adjusting
aerosol properties corrects the raw PMS A003 measurement for specific size bins with normalized
mean absolute error within 4.0% of the reference instrument. Although the Bayesian Information
Criterion suggests that models adjusting for particle optical properties and relative humidity
are technically superior, they should be used with caution as the particle properties used in fitting
were within a narrow range for challenge aerosols. The calibration models adjusted for particle
CRI and density account for non-linearity in the OEM's mass concentrations estimates and demonstrated
lower error. These results have significant implications for using PMS A003 in high concentration
environments, including indoor air quality and occupational/industrial exposure assessments,
wildfire smoke, or near-source monitoring scenarios.

Quantitative information on tumor heterogeneity and cell load could assist in designing effective
and refined personalized treatment strategies. It was recently shown by us that such information
can be inferred from the diffusion parameter D derived from the diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) if
a relation between D and cell density can be established. However, such relation cannot a priori
be assumed to be constant for all patients and tumor types. Hence to assist in clinical decisions
in palliative settings, the relation needs to be established without tumor resection. It is here
demonstrated that biopsies may contain sufficient information for this purpose if the localization
of biopsies is chosen as systematically elaborated in this paper. A superpixel-based method for
automated optimal localization of biopsies from the DWI D-map is proposed. The performance of the
DWI-guided procedure is evaluated by extensive simulations of biopsies. Needle biopsies yield
sufficient histological information to establish a quantitative relationship between D-value
and cell density, provided they are taken from regions with high, intermediate, and low D-value
in DWI. The automated localization of the biopsy regions is demonstrated from a NSCLC patient tumor.
In this case, even two or three biopsies give a reasonable estimate. Simulations of needle biopsies
under different conditions indicate that the DWI-guidance highly improves the estimation results.
Tumor cellularity and heterogeneity in solid tumors may be reliably investigated from DWI and a
few needle biopsies that are sampled in regions of well-separated D-values, excluding adipose
tissue. This procedure could provide a way of embedding in the clinical workflow assistance in cancer
diagnosis and treatment based on personalized information.

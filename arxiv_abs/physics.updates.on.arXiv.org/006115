Mathematical modelling of the spread of epidemics has been an interesting challenge in the field
of epidemiology. The SIR Model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 is a prototypical model
of epidemiology. However, it has its limitations. In this paper, we show two independent ways of
generalizing this model, the first one if the vaccine isn't discovered or ready to use and the next
one, if the vaccine is discovered and ready to use. In the first part, we have pointed out a major over-simplification,
i.e., assumption of variation of the time derivatives of the variables with the linear or quadratic
powers of the individual variables and introduce two new parameters to incorporate further nonlinearity
in the number of infected people in the model. As a result of this, we show how this additional nonlinearity,
in the newly introduced parameters, can bring a significant shift in the peak time of infection,
i.e., the time at which the infected population reaches maximum. We show that in special cases, even
we can get a transition from epidemic to a non-epidemic stage of a particular infectious disease.
We further study one such special case and treat it as a problem of phase transition. Then, we investigate
all the necessary parameters of this phase transition, like the order parameter and critical exponent.
We observe that $O_p \sim (q_c-q)^{\beta}$. {\it As far as we know the phase transition and its quantification
in terms of the scaling behaviour is not yet know in the context of pandemic}. In the second part, we
incorporate in the model, a consideration of artificial herd immunity and show how we can decrease
the peak time of infection with a subsequent decrease in the maximum number of infected people.

The spatial diffusion of epidemic disease follows distance decay law in geography, but different
diffusion processes may be modeled by different mathematical functions under different spatio-temporal
conditions. This paper is devoted to modeling spatial diffusion patterns of COVID-19 stemming
from Wuhan city to Hubei province. The methods include gravity and spatial auto-regression analyses.
The local gravity model is derived from allometric scaling and global gravity model, and then the
parameters of the local gravity model are estimated by observational data and linear regression.
The main results are as below. The local gravity model based on power law decay can effectively describe
the diffusion patterns and process of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, and the goodness of fit of the gravity
model based on negative exponential decay to the observation data is not satisfactory. Further,
the goodness of fit of the model to data entirely became better and better over time, the size elasticity
coefficient increases first and then decreases, and the distance attenuation exponent decreases
first and then increases. Moreover, the significance of spatial autoregressive coefficient in
the model is low, and the confidence level is less than 80%. The conclusions can be reached as follows.
(1) The spatial diffusion of COVID-19 of Hubei bears long range effect, and the size of a city and the
distance of the city to Wuhan affect the total number of confirmed cases. (2) Wuhan direct transmission
is the main process in the spatial diffusion of COVID-19 in Hubei at the early stage, and the horizontal
transmission between regions is not significant. (3) The effect of spatial isolation measures
taken by Chinese government against the transmission of COVID-19 is obvious. This study suggests
that the role of gravity should be taken into account to prevent and control epidemic disease.

In Specific Power Absorption (SPA) models for Magnetic Fluid Hyperthermia (MFH) experiments,
the magnetic relaxation time of the nanoparticles (NPs) is known to be a fundamental descriptor
of the heating mechanisms. The relaxation time is mainly determined by the interplay between the
magnetic properties of the NPs and the rheological properties of NPs environment. Although the
role of magnetism in MFH has been extensively studied, the thermal properties of the NPs medium and
their changes during of MFH experiments have been so far underrated. Here, we show that ZnxFe3-xO4
NPs dispersed through different with phase transition in the temperature range of the experiment:
clarified butter oil (CBO) and paraffin. These systems show non-linear behavior of the heating
rate within the temperature range of the MFH experiments. For CBO, a fast increase at $306 K$ associated
to changes in the viscosity (\texteta(T)) and specific heat (c_p(T)) of the medium below and above
its melting temperature. This increment in the heating rate takes place around $318 K$ for paraffin.
Magnetic and morphological characterizations of NPs together with the observed agglomeration
of the nanoparticles above $306 K$ indicate that the fast increase in MFH curves could not be associated
to a change in the magnetic relaxation mechanism, with N\'eel relaxation being dominant. In fact,
successive experiment runs performed up to temperatures below and above the CBO melting point resulted
in different MFH curves due to agglomeration of NPs driven by magnetic field inhomogeneity during
the experiments. Similar effects were observed for paraffin. Our results highlight the relevance
of the NPs medium's thermodynamic properties for an accurate measurement of the heating efficiency
for in vitro and in vivo environments, where the thermal properties are largely variable within
the temperature window of MFH experiments.

Breaking waves entrain gas beneath the surface. The wave-breaking process energizes turbulent
fluctuations that break bubbles in quick succession to generate a wide range of bubble sizes. Understanding
this generation mechanism paves the way towards the development of predictive models for large-scale
maritime and climate simulations. Garrett et al. (2000) suggested that super-Hinze-scale turbulent
breakup transfers entrained gas from large to small bubble sizes in the manner of a cascade. We provide
a theoretical basis for this bubble-mass cascade by appealing to how energy is transferred from
large to small scales in the energy cascade central to single-phase turbulence theories. A bubble
break-up cascade requires that break-up events predominantly transfer bubble mass from a certain
bubble size to a slightly smaller size on average. This property is called locality. In this paper,
we analytically quantify locality by extending the population balance equation in conservative
form to derive the bubble-mass transfer rate from large to small sizes. Using our proposed measures
of locality, we show that scalings relevant to turbulent bubbly flows, including those postulated
by Garrett et al. (2000) and observed in breaking-wave experiments and simulations, are consistent
with a strongly local transfer rate, where the influence of non-local contributions decays in a
power-law fashion. These theoretical predictions are confirmed using numerical simulations
in Part 2, revealing key physical aspects of the bubble break-up cascade phenomenology. Locality
supports the universality of turbulent small-bubble break-up, which simplifies the development
of subgrid-scale models to predict oceanic small-bubble statistics of practical importance.

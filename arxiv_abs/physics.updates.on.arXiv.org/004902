Improvement of tool reliability and uptime is a current focus in development of extreme ultraviolet
lithography. The lifetime of collection mirrors for extreme ultraviolet light in tin-based plasma
light sources is limited considerably by contamination with thick tin deposits that cannot be removed
sufficiently fast by plasma etching. For tin droplet splats sticking to large substrates, we have
developed and compared several efficient cleaning techniques based on cryogenic cooling. A silicon
carbide substrate and different silicon wafer samples with up to 6 inch diameter with the surface
uncoated, multilayer-coated, unstructured and grating-structured were tested. After tin dripping
onto heated samples, embrittlement of droplet contamination is induced in-situ by stresses during
phase transformation, following the initiation of tin pest with seed crystals of gray tin. Conversion
of initially adhesive deposits to loose gray tin has been reached in less than 24 hours on all tested
surfaces by continuous cooling with cold nitrogen vapor to temperatures in the range of -30 to -50
{\deg}C. Alternatively, stress-initiated tin-removal by delamination of beta-Sn droplet splats
has been attained via contraction strain induced by strong cooling to temperatures of around -120
{\deg}C. Profilometry has been used to analyze the bottom side of tin droplet splats removed from
a grating-structured wafer. The in-situ tin cleaning techniques give results comparable to fast
ex-situ cleaning that has been achieved either by sample immersion in liquid nitrogen or by splat
removal after CO2 snowflake aerosol impact using a hand-held jet-nozzle. The implementation of
the in-situ phase-conversion concept for the cleaning of collector mirrors in commercial light
sources for lithography is discussed.

Large-eddy simulation (LES) is able to capture key boundary-layer (BL) turbulence and cloud processes.
Yet, large-scale forcing and surface turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat are often poorly
constrained for LES simulations. We derive these quantities from measurements and reanalysis
obtained for two cold air outbreak (CAO) events during Phase I of the Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions
oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) in February-March 2020. We study the two contrasting
CAO cases by performing LES simulations and test the sensitivity of BL structure and clouds to large-scale
forcings and turbulent heat fluxes. Profiles of atmospheric state and large-scale divergence
and surface turbulent heat fluxes obtained from the reanalysis data ERA5 agree reasonably well
with those derived from ACTIVATE field measurements for both cases at the sampling time and location.
Therefore, we adopt the time evolving heat fluxes, wind and advective tendencies profiles from
ERA5 reanalysis data to drive the LES simulations. We find that large-scale thermodynamic advective
tendencies and wind relaxations are important for the LES to capture the evolving observed BL meteorological
states characterized by the hourly ERA5 reanalysis data and validated by the observations. We show
that the divergence (or vertical advection) is important in regulating the BL growth driven by surface
heat fluxes in LES simulations. The evolution of liquid water path is largely affected by the evolution
of surface heat fluxes. The liquid water path simulated in LES agrees reasonably well with the ACTIVATE
measurements. This study paves the path to investigate aerosol-cloud-meteorology interactions
using LES informed and evaluated by ACTIVATE field measurements.

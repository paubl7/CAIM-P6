Low-level jets (LLJs) are the wind maxima in the lower regions of the atmosphere with a high wind energy
potential. Here we use large-eddy simulations to study the effect of LLJ height on the flow dynamics
in a wind farm with $10\times4$ turbines. We change the LLJ height and atmospheric thermal stratification
by varying the surface cooling rate. We find that the first row power production is higher in the presence
of a LLJ compared to a neutral reference case without LLJ. Besides, we show that the first row power
production increases with decreasing LLJ height. Due to the higher turbulence intensity, the wind
turbine wakes recover faster in a neutral boundary layer than in a stably stratified one. However,
for strong thermal stratification with a low-height LLJ, the wake recovery can be faster than for
the neutral reference case as energy can be entrained from the LLJ. Flow visualizations reveal that
under stable stratification the growth of wind farm's internal boundary layer is restricted and
the wind flows around the wind farm. Wind farms extract energy from LLJs through wake meandering
and turbulent entrainment depending on the LLJ height. Both effects are advantageous for wake recovery,
which is beneficial for the performance of downwind turbines. This finding is confirmed by an energy
budget analysis, which reveals a significant increase in the kinetic energy flux in the presence
of a LLJ. The jet strength reduces as it passes through consecutive turbine rows. For strong stratification,
the combined effect of buoyancy destruction and turbulence dissipation is larger than the turbulent
entrainment. Therefore, the power production of turbines in the back of the wind farm is relatively
low for strong atmospheric stratifications.

The subsequent series of responses to big events may exhibit a synchronicity of event number, frequency
and energy release in different fault zones. This synchronicity is a reliable source for probing
non-intuitive geological structures, assessing regional seismicity hazard map and even predicting
the next big events. The synchronicity of main faults in the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan
Plateau is still unknown to us. We propose to examine the correlation of earthquake occurrence among
different fault zones to indicate this synchronicity, and to obtain a preliminary understanding
of geodynamics processes and the unrecognized characteristics of deep evolution in the eastern
margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We estimate temporal changes of completeness level, frequency
seismicity, and intensity seismicity, referring respectively to Mc, Z, and E values, of 21 main
fault zones, using a seismic catalogue from 1970 to 2015. Our results reveal that six fault zone pairs
of fault zones exhibit relative high correlation (>0.6) by all three indicators, while four fault
zone pairs are non-adjacent with close internal affinity offsetting the limit of spatial distance,
such as the pair of Rongjing-mabian fault and Minjiang-huya fault. Most strikingly, some fault
zone pairs showing typical high correlation (>0.8) of seismicity frequency or seismicity intensity,
the faults surprisingly belong to neither the same seismic belt nor the same geological block, exhibiting
a regional scale remote triggering pattern of earthquakes or structures. An embryonic pattern
to predict the next possible events will also be presented. This correlation analysis discovers
a previously unrecognized strong coupling relationship among main faults with high earthquake
risk in the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

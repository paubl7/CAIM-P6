[Abridged]We present high-resolution three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of breaking
waves solving the two-phase Navier-Stokes equations. We investigate the role of the Reynolds and
Bond numbers on the energy, bubble and droplet statistics of strong plunging breakers, and explore
the asymptotic regimes at high Reynolds and Bond numbers to be compared with laboratory breaking
waves. Energetically, we show that the breaking wave transitions from laminar to three-dimensional
turbulent flow on a timescale that depends on the turbulent Reynolds number up to a limiting value
of $Re_\lambda \sim 100$, consistent with the mixing transition observed in other canonical turbulent
flows. We characterize the role of capillary effects on the impacting jet and ingested main cavity
shape and subsequent fragmentation process. We confirm two distinct power-law regimes in the bubble
size distribution, separated by the Hinze scale $r_H$. We also confirm the interplay between the
generation of bubbles with the turbulent dissipation rate and extend the buoyant-energetic scaling
of Deike et al. (2016) to account for further Bond number effects. We show resolved bubbles up to one
order of magnitude below the Hinze scale and observe a good collapse of the numerical data, both above
and below the Hinze scale, compared to laboratory breaking wave Deane and Stokes (2002). We resolve
droplet statistics and our data show good agreement with recent experiments (Erinin et al., 2009)
in various statistics. We present velocity distributions for the droplets, finding ejection velocities
up to four times the phase speed of the wave, which are produced during the most intense splashing
events of the breaking process. This study paves the way for future integrated studies of the statistics
of energetics, bubbles and droplets and their interdependences in breaking ocean waves and multiphase
turbulent flows.

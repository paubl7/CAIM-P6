The ability to accurately extract low-amplitude voltage signals is crucial in several fields,
ranging from single-use diagnostics and medical technology to robotics and the Internet of Things.
The organic electrochemical transistor, which features large transconductance values at low
operation voltages, is ideal for monitoring small signals. Its large transconductance translates
small gate voltage variations into significant changes in the drain current. However, a current-to-voltage
conversion is further needed to allow proper data acquisition and signal processing. Low power
consumption, high amplification, and manufacturability on flexible and low-cost carriers are
also crucial and highly anticipated for targeted applications. Here, we report low-power and high-gain
flexible circuits based on printed complementary organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs).
We leverage the low threshold voltage of both p-type and n-type enhancement-mode OECTs to develop
complementary voltage amplifiers that can sense voltages as low as 100 $\mu$V, with gains of 30.4
dB and at a power consumption < 2.7 $\mu$W (single-stage amplifier). At the optimal operating conditions,
the voltage gain normalized to power consumption reaches 169 dB/$\mu$W, which is > 50 times larger
than state-of-the-art OECT-based amplifiers. In a two-stage configuration, the complementary
voltage amplifiers reach a DC voltage gain of 193 V/V, which is the highest among emerging CMOS-like
technologies operating at supply voltages below 1 volt. Our findings demonstrate that flexible
complementary circuits based on printed OECTs define a power-efficient platform for sensing and
amplifying low-amplitude voltage signals in several emerging beyond-silicon applications.

Ground observatory and satellite-based determinations of temporal variations in the geomagnetic
field probe a decadal to annual time scale range where Earth's core slow, inertialess convective
motions and rapidly propagating, inertia-bearing hydromagnetic waves are in interplay. Here
we numerically model and jointly investigate these two important features with the help of a geodynamo
simulation that (to date) is the closest to the dynamical regime of Earth's core. This model also
considerably enlarges the scope of a previous asymptotic scaling analysis. Three classes of hydrodynamic
and hydromagnetic waves are identified in the model output, all with propagation velocity largely
exceeding that of convective advection: axisymmetric, geostrophic Alfv\'en torsional waves,
and non-axisymmetric, quasi-geostrophic Alfv\'en and Rossby waves. The contribution of these
waves to the geomagnetic acceleration amounts to an enrichment and flattening of its energy density
spectral profile at decadal time scales, thereby providing a constraint on the extent of the $f^{-4}$
range observed in the geomagnetic frequency power spectrum. The flow and magnetic acceleration
energies carried by waves both linearly increase with the ratio of the magnetic diffusion time scale
to the Alfv\'en time scale, highlighting the dominance of Alfv\'en waves in the signal and the stabilising
control of magnetic dissipation at non-axisymmetric scales. Extrapolation of the results to Earth's
core conditions supports the detectability of Alfv\'en waves in geomagnetic observations, either
as axisymmetric torsional oscillations or through the geomagnetic jerks caused by non-axisymmetric
waves. In contrast, Rossby waves appear to be too fast and carry too little magnetic energy to be detectable
in geomagnetic acceleration signals of limited spatio-temporal resolution.

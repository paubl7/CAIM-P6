The weights of a deep neural network model are optimized in conjunction with the governing flow equations
to provide a model for sub-grid-scale stresses in a temporally developing plane turbulent jet at
Reynolds number $Re_0=6\,000$. The objective function for training is first based on the instantaneous
filtered velocity fields from a corresponding direct numerical simulation, and the training is
by a stochastic gradient descent method, which uses the adjoint Navier--Stokes equations to provide
the end-to-end sensitivities of the model weights to the velocity fields. In-sample and out-of-sample
testing on multiple dual-jet configurations show that its required mesh density in each coordinate
direction for prediction of mean flow, Reynolds stresses, and spectra is half that needed by the
dynamic Smagorinsky model for comparable accuracy. The same neural-network model trained directly
to match filtered sub-grid-scale stresses -- without the constraint of being embedded within the
flow equations during the training -- fails to provide a qualitatively correct prediction. The
coupled formulation is generalized to train based only on mean-flow and Reynolds stresses, which
are more readily available in experiments. The mean-flow training provides a robust model, which
is important, though a somewhat less accurate prediction for the same coarse meshes, as might be
anticipated due to the reduced information available for training in this case. The anticipated
advantage of the formulation is that the inclusion of resolved physics in the training increases
its capacity to extrapolate. This is assessed for the case of passive scalar transport, for which
it outperforms established models due to improved mixing predictions.

Purpose: Radiation therapy treatment planning is a trial-and-error, often time-consuming process.
An optimal dose distribution based on a specific anatomy can be predicted by pre-trained deep learning
(DL) models. However, dose distributions are often optimized based on not only patient-specific
anatomy but also physician preferred trade-offs between planning target volume (PTV) coverage
and organ at risk (OAR) sparing. Therefore, it is desirable to allow physicians to fine-tune the
dose distribution predicted based on patient anatomy. In this work, we developed a DL model to predict
the individualized 3D dose distributions by using not only the anatomy but also the desired PTV/OAR
trade-offs, as represented by a dose volume histogram (DVH), as inputs. Methods: The desired DVH,
fine-tuned by physicians from the initially predicted DVH, is first projected onto the Pareto surface,
then converted into a vector, and then concatenated with mask feature maps. The network output for
training is the dose distribution corresponding to the Pareto optimal DVH. The training/validation
datasets contain 77 prostate cancer patients, and the testing dataset has 20 patients. Results:
The trained model can predict a 3D dose distribution that is approximately Pareto optimal. We calculated
the difference between the predicted and the optimized dose distribution for the PTV and all OARs
as a quantitative evaluation. The largest average error in mean dose was about 1.6% of the prescription
dose, and the largest average error in the maximum dose was about 1.8%. Conclusions: In this feasibility
study, we have developed a 3D U-Net model with the anatomy and desired DVH as inputs to predict an individualized
3D dose distribution. The predicted dose distributions can be used as references for dosimetrists
and physicians to rapidly develop a clinically acceptable treatment plan.

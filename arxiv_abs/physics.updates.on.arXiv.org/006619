The role of solar wind expansion in generating whistler waves is investigated using the EB-iPic3D
code, which models solar wind expansion self-consistently within a fully kinetic semi-implicit
approach. The simulation is initialized with an electron velocity distribution function modeled
after Parker Solar Probe observations during its first perihelion at 0.166 au, consisting of a dense
core and an anti-sunward strahl. This distribution function is initially stable with respect to
kinetic instabilities. Expansion drives the solar wind into successive regimes where whistler
heat flux instabilities are triggered. These instabilities produce sunward whistler waves initially
characterized by predominantly oblique propagation with respect to the interplanetary magnetic
field. The excited waves interact with the electrons via resonant scattering processes. As a consequence,
the strahl pitch angle distribution broadens and its drift velocity reduces. Strahl electrons
are scattered in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field, and an electron halo is formed.
At a later stage, resonant electron firehose instability is triggered and further affects the electron
temperature anisotropy as the solar wind expands. Wave-particle interaction processes are accompanied
by a substantial reduction of the solar wind heat flux. The simulated whistler waves are in qualitative
agreement with observations in terms of wave frequencies, amplitudes and propagation angles.
Our work proposes an explanation for the observations of oblique and parallel whistler waves in
the solar wind. We conclude that solar wind expansion has to be factored in when trying to explain
kinetic processes at different heliocentric distances.

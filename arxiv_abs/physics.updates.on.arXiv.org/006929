We compare the characteristics of flare-accelerated energetic electrons at the Sun with those
injected into interplanetary space. We have identified 17 energetic electron events well-observed
with the SEPT instrument aboard STEREO which show a clear association with a hard X-ray (HXR) flare
observed with the RHESSI spacecraft. We compare the spectral indices of the RHESSI HXR spectra with
those of the interplanetary electrons. Because of the frequent double-power-law shape of the in
situ electron spectra, we paid special attention to the choice of the spectral index used for comparison.
The time difference between the electron onsets and the associated type III and microwave bursts
suggests that the electron events are detected at 1 AU with apparent delays ranging from 9 to 41 minutes.
While the parent solar activity is clearly impulsive, also showing a high correlation with extreme
ultraviolet jets, most of the studied events occur in temporal coincidence with coronal mass ejections
(CMEs). In spite of the observed onset delays and presence of CMEs in the low corona, we find a significant
correlation of about 0.8 between the spectral indices of the HXR flare and the in situ electrons.
The correlations increase if only events with significant anisotropy are considered. This suggests
that transport effects can alter the injected spectra leading to a strongly reduced imprint of the
flare acceleration. We conclude that interplanetary transport effects must be taken into account
when inferring the initial acceleration of solar energetic electron events. Although our results
suggest a clear imprint of flare acceleration for the analyzed event sample, a secondary acceleration
might be present which could account for the observed delays. However, the limited and variable
pitch-angle coverage of SEPT could also be the reason for the observed delays.

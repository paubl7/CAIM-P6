We study the task of selecting $k$ nodes in a social network of size $n$, to seed a diffusion with maximum
expected spread size, under the independent cascade model with cascade probability $p$. Most of
the previous work on this problem (known as influence maximization) focuses on efficient algorithms
to approximate the optimal seed set with provable guarantees, given the knowledge of the entire
network. However, in practice, obtaining full knowledge of the network is very costly. To address
this gap, we first study the achievable guarantees using $o(n)$ influence samples. We provide an
approximation algorithm with a tight $(1-1/e){\mbox{OPT}}-\epsilon n$ guarantee, using $O_{\epsilon}(k^2\log
n)$ influence samples and show that this dependence on $k$ is asymptotically optimal. We then propose
a probing algorithm that queries ${O}_{\epsilon}(p n^2\log^4 n + \sqrt{k p} n^{1.5}\log^{5.5}
n + k n\log^{3.5}{n})$ edges from the graph and use them to find a seed set with the same almost tight
approximation guarantee. We also provide a matching (up to logarithmic factors) lower-bound on
the required number of edges. To address the dependence of our probing algorithm on the independent
cascade probability $p$, we show that it is impossible to maintain the same approximation guarantees
by controlling the discrepancy between the probing and seeding cascade probabilities. Instead,
we propose to down-sample the probed edges to match the seeding cascade probability, provided that
it does not exceed that of probing. Finally, we test our algorithms on real world data to quantify
the trade-off between the cost of obtaining more refined network information and the benefit of
the added information for guiding improved seeding strategies.

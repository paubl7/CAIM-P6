This paper aims at investigating the existence of localized stationary waves in the shallow subsurface
whose constitutive behaviour is governed by the hyperbolic model, implying non-polynomial nonlinearity
and strain-dependent shear modulus. To this end, we derive a novel equation of motion for a nonlinear
gradient elasticity model, where the higher-order gradient terms capture the effect of small-scale
soil heterogeneity/micro-structure. We also present a novel finite-difference scheme to solve
the nonlinear equation of motion in space and time. Simulations of the propagation of arbitrary
initial pulses clearly reveal the influence of the nonlinearity: strain-dependent speed in general
and, as a result, sharpening of the pulses. Stationary solutions of the equation of motion are obtained
by introducing the moving reference frame together with the stationarity assumption. Periodic
(with and without a descending trend), as well as localized stationary waves, are found by analyzing
the obtained ordinary differential equation in the phase portrait, and integrating it along the
different trajectories. The localized stationary wave is in fact a kink wave and is obtained by integration
along a homoclinic orbit. In general, the closer the trajectory lies to a homoclinic orbit, the sharper
the edges of the corresponding periodic stationary wave and the larger its period. Finally, we find
that the kink wave is in fact not a true soliton as the original shapes of two colliding kink waves are
not recovered after interaction. However, it may have high amplitude and reach the surface depending
on the damping mechanisms (which have not been considered). Therefore, seismic site response analyses
should not a priori exclude the presence of such localized stationary waves.

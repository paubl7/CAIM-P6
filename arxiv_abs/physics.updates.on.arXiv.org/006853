In computational physics and mathematical physics, modal analysis method has been one of important
study topics. The central purposes of this Post-Doctoral Concluding Report are (1) to reveal the
core position of energy viewpoint in the realm of electromagnetic modal analysis; (2) to show how
to do energy-viewpoint-based modal analysis for various electromagnetic structures. The major
conclusions of this report are that: energy conservation law governs the energy utilization processes
of various electromagnetic structures, and its energy source term sustains the steady energy utilization
processes; the whole modal space of an electromagnetic structure is spanned by a series of energy-decoupled
modes (DMs), which don't have net energy exchange in any integral period; the DMs can be effectively
constructed by orthogonalizing energy source operator, which is just the operator form of the energy
source term. Specifically speaking: in classical electromagnetism, energy conservation law
has five different manifestation forms, that are power transport theorem (PTT), partial-structure-oriented
work-energy theorem (PS-WET), entire-structure-oriented work-energy theorem (ES-WET), Poynting's
theorem (PtT), and Lorentz's reciprocity theorem (LRT) forms; the energy source terms in the first
four forms are formulated as input power operator (IPO), partial-structure-oriented driving
power operator (PS-DPO), entire-structure-oriented driving power operator (ES-DPO), and Poynting's
flux operator (PtFO); the DMs of wave-port-fed, lumped-port-driven, externally-incident-field-driven,
and energy-dissipating/self-oscillating electromagnetic structures can be constructed by
orthogonalizing IPO, PS-DPO, ES-DPO, and PtFO; LRT guarantees that the obtained DMs satisfy some
useful Em-Hn orthogonality relations, where the Em and Hn represent the electric field of the m-th
DM and the magnetic field of the n-th DM.

A general framework for Maxwell-Oldroyd type differential constitutive models is examined, in
which an unspecified nonlinear function of the stress and rate-of-deformation tensors is incorporated
into the well-known corotational version of the Jeffreys model discussed by Oldroyd. For medium
amplitude simple shear deformations, the recently developed mathematical framework of medium
amplitude parallel superposition (MAPS) rheology reveals that this generalized nonlinear Maxwell
model can produce only a limited number of distinct signatures, which combine linearly in a well-posed
basis expansion for the third order complex viscosity. This basis expansion represents a library
of MAPS signatures for distinct constitutive models that are contained within the generalized
nonlinear Maxwell model. We describe a framework for quantitative model identification using
this basis expansion, and discuss its limitations in distinguishing distinct nonlinear features
of the underlying constitutive models from medium amplitude shear stress data. The leading order
contributions to the normal stress differences are also considered, revealing that only the second
normal stress difference provides distinct information about the weakly nonlinear response space
of the model. After briefly considering the conditions for time-strain separability within the
generalized nonlinear Maxwell model, we apply the basis expansion of the third order complex viscosity
to derive the medium amplitude signatures of the model in specific shear deformation protocols.
Finally, we use these signatures for estimation of model parameters from rheological data obtained
by these different deformation protocols, revealing that three-tone oscillatory shear deformations
produce data that is readily able to distinguish all features of the medium amplitude, simple shear
response space of this generalized class of constitutive models.

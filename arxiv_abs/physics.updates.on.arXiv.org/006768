Within the framework of diffuse interface methods, we derive a pressure-based Baer-Nunziato type
model well-suited to weakly compressible multiphase flows. The model can easily deal with different
equation of states and it includes relaxation terms characterized by user-defined finite parameters,
which drive the pressure and velocity of each phase toward the equilibrium. There is no clear notion
of speed of sound, and thus, most of the classical low Mach approximation cannot easily be cast in
this context. The proposed solution strategy consists of two operators: a semi-implicit finite-volume
solver for the hyperbolic part and an ODE integrator for the relaxation processes. Being the acoustic
terms in the hyperbolic part integrated implicitly, the stability condition on the time step is
lessened. The discretization of non-conservative terms involving the gradient of the volume fraction
fulfills by construction the non-disturbance condition on pressure and velocity to avoid oscillations
across the multimaterial interfaces. The developed simulation tool is validated through one-dimensional
simulations of shock-tube and Riemann-problems, involving water-aluminum and water-air mixtures,
vapor-liquid mixture of water and of carbon dioxide, and almost pure flows. The numerical results
match analytical and reference ones, except some expected discrepancies across shocks, which
however remain acceptable (errors within some percentage points). All tests were performed with
acoustic CFL numbers greater than one, and no stability issues arose, even for CFL greater than 10.
The effects of different values of relaxation parameters and of different amount equations of state
-- stiffened gas and Peng-Robinson -- were investigated.

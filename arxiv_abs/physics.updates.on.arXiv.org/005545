Purpose: To demonstrate a proton imaging system based on well-established fast scintillator technology
to achieve high performance with low cost and complexity, with the potential of a straightforward
translation into clinical use. Methods: The system tracks individual protons through one (X, Y)
scintillating fiber tracker plane upstream and downstream of the object and into a 13 cm-thick scintillating
block residual energy detector. The fibers in the tracker planes are multiplexed into silicon photomultipliers
(SiPMs) to reduce the number of electronics channels. The light signal from the residual energy
detector is collected by 16 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). Only four signals from the PMTs are output
from each event, which allows for fast signal readout. A robust calibration method of the PMT signal
to residual energy has been developed to obtain accurate proton images. The development of patient-specific
scan patterns using multiple input energies allows for an image to be produced with minimal excess
dose delivered to the patient. Results: The calibration of signals in the energy detector produces
accurate residual range measurements limited by intrinsic range straggling. We measured the water-equivalent
thickness (WET) of a block of solid water (physical thickness of 6.10 mm) with a proton radiograph.
The mean WET from all pixels in the block was 6.13 cm (SD 0.02 cm). The use of patient-specific scan
patterns using multiple input energies enables imaging with a compact range detector. Conclusions:
We have developed a prototype clinical proton radiography system for pretreatment imaging in proton
radiation therapy. We have optimized the system for use with pencil beam scanning systems and have
achieved a reduction of size and complexity compared to previous designs.

Using simulation to predict the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous materials has applications
ranging from topology optimization to multi-scale structural analysis. However, full-fidelity
simulation techniques such as Finite Element Analysis can be prohibitively computationally expensive
when they are used to explore the massive input parameter space of heterogeneous materials. Therefore,
there has been significant recent interest in machine learning-based models that, once trained,
can predict mechanical behavior at a fraction of the computational cost. Over the past several years,
research in this area has been focused mainly on predicting single Quantities of Interest (QoIs).
However, there has recently been an increased interest in a more challenging problem: predicting
full-field QoI (e.g., displacement/strain fields, damage fields) for mechanical problems. Due
to the added complexity of full-field information, network architectures that perform well on
single QoI problems may perform poorly in the full-field QoI problem setting. The work presented
in this paper is twofold. First, we made a significant extension to the Mechanical MNIST dataset
designed to enable the investigation of full field QoI prediction. Specifically, we added Finite
Element simulation results of quasi-static brittle fracture in a heterogeneous material captured
with the phase-field method. Second, we established strong baseline performance for predicting
full-field QoI with MultiRes-WNet architecture. In addition to presenting the results in this
paper, we have released our model implementation and the Mechanical MNIST Crack Path dataset under
open-source licenses. We anticipate that future researchers will directly use our model architecture
on related datasets and potentially design models that exceed the baseline performance for predicting
full-field QoI established in this paper.

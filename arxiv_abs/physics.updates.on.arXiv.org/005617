In a multi-electron atom, an excited electron can decay by emitting a photon. Typically, the leftover
electrons are in their ground state. In a radiative Auger process, the leftover electrons are in
an excited state and a redshifted photon is created. In a semiconductor quantum dot, radiative Auger
is predicted for charged excitons. Here we report the observation of radiative Auger on trions in
single quantum dots. For a trion, a photon is created on electron-hole recombination, leaving behind
a single electron. The radiative Auger process promotes this additional (Auger) electron to a higher
shell of the quantum dot. We show that the radiative Auger effect is a powerful probe of this single
electron: the energy separations between the resonance fluorescence and the radiative Auger emission
directly measure the single-particle splittings of the electronic states in the quantum dot with
high precision. In semiconductors, these single-particle splittings are otherwise hard to access
by optical means as particles are excited typically in pairs, as excitons. After the radiative Auger
emission, the Auger carrier relaxes back to the lowest shell. Going beyond the original theoretical
proposals, we show how applying quantum optics techniques to the radiative Auger photons gives
access to the single-electron dynamics, notably relaxation and tunneling. This is also hard to
access by optical means: even for quasi-resonant $p$-shell excitation, electron relaxation takes
place in the presence of a hole, complicating the relaxation dynamics. The radiative Auger effect
can be exploited in other semiconductor nanostructures and quantum emitters in the solid state
to determine the energy levels and the dynamics of a single carrier.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and objective seizure identification is an essential
clinical investigation for some patients with epilepsy. Accurate annotation is done through a
time-consuming process by EEG specialists. Computer-assisted systems for seizure detection
currently lack extensive clinical utility due to retrospective, patient-specific, and/or irreproducible
studies that result in low sensitivity or high false positives in clinical tests. We aim to significantly
reduce the time and resources on data annotation by demonstrating a continental generalization
of seizure detection that balances sensitivity and specificity. This is a prospective inference
test of artificial intelligence on nearly 14,590 hours of adult EEG data from patients with epilepsy
between 2011 and 2019 in a hospital in Sydney, Australia. The inference set includes patients with
different types and frequencies of seizures across a wide range of ages and EEG recording hours.
We validated our inference model in an AI-assisted mode with a human expert arbiter and a result review
panel of expert neurologists and EEG specialists on 66 sessions to demonstrate achievement of the
same performance with over an order-of-magnitude reduction in time. Our inference on 1,006 EEG
recording sessions on the Australian dataset achieved 76.68% with nearly 56 [0, 115] false alarms
per 24 hours on average, against legacy ground-truth annotations by human experts, conducted independently
over nine years. Our pilot test of 66 sessions with a human arbiter, and reviewed ground truth by a
panel of experts, confirmed an identical human performance of 92.19% with an AI-assisted system,
while the time requirements reduce significantly from 90 to 7.62 minutes on average.

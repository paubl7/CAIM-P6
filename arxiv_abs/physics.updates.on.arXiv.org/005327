(Abridged) Aim: We attempt to determine robust estimates of the heliospheric magnetic flux ($\Phi_H$)
using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) data, analyze how susceptible this is to overestimation compared
to the true open flux ($\Phi_{open}$), assess its dependence on time and space, and compare it to
simple estimates from Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) models. Methods: We compare different
methods of computation using data from PSP, STEREO A and Wind. The effects of fluctuations and large
scale structure on the estimate are probed by using measured radial trends to produce synthetic
data. Best estimates are computed as a function of time and space, and compared to estimates from
PFSS models. Results: Radially-varying fluctuations of the HMF vector and variation of the Parker
spiral angle cause the standard metrics of the mean and mode to evolve with radius independent of
the central value about which the vector fluctuates. This is best mitigated by projecting the vector
into the background Parker spiral direction. Nevertheless, we find a small enhancement in flux
close to 1AU. The fraction of locally inverted field lines grows with radial distance from the Sun
which remains a possible physical reason for this excess, but is negligible at PSP`s perihelia.
Similarly, the impact of fluctuations in general is much reduced at PSP`s perihelia. The overall
best estimate is ~2.5 nT AU2 . No strong dependence on latitude or longitude is apparent. The PFSS
models predict lower values from 1.2 to 1.8 nT AU2. Conclusions: The heliospheric flux is robustly
estimated relative to a mean Parker spiral direction at PSP`s perihelia where the decay of fluctuations
and weakening importance of local flux inversions means $\Phi_H$ ~ $\Phi_{open}$. Despite this,
the estimate remains too high to be explained by PFSS models, supporting the idea that coronal models
underestimate the open magnetic flux.

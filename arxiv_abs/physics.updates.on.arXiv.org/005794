A Lagrangian experimental study of an axisymmetric turbulent water jet is performed to investigate
the highly anisotropic and inhomogeneous flow field. The measurements were conducted within a
Lagrangian exploration module, an icosahedron apparatus, to facilitate optical access of three
cameras. The stereoscopic particle tracking velocimetry results in three component tracks of
position, velocity and acceleration of the tracer particles within the vertically-oriented jet
with a Taylor-based Reynolds number $\mathcal R_\lambda \simeq 230$. Analysis is performed at
seven locations from 15 diameters up to 45 diameters downstream. Eulerian analysis is first carried
out to obtain critical parameters of the jet and relevant scales, namely the Kolmogorov and large
turnover (integral) scales as well as the energy dissipation rate. Lagrangian statistical analysis
is then performed on velocity components stationarised following methods inspired by Batchelor
(\textit{J. Fluid Mech.}, vol. 3, 1957, pp. 67-80) which aim to extend stationary Lagrangian theory
of turbulent diffusion by Taylor to the case of self-similar flows. The evolution of typical Lagrangian
scaling parameters as a function of the developing jet is explored and results show validation of
the proposed stationarisation. The universal scaling constant $C_0$ (for the Lagrangian second-order
structure function), as well as Eulerian and Lagrangian integral time scales are discussed in this
context. $C_0$ is found to converge to a constant value (of the order of $C_0 = 3$) within 30 diameters
downstream of the nozzle. Finally, the existence of finite particle size effects are investigated
through consideration of acceleration dependent quantities.

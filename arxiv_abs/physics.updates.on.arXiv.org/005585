We demonstrate that a simple model based on reaction-diffusion-advection (RDA) equation forced
by realistic surface velocities and nutrients is skilled in reproducing the distributions of the
surface phytoplankton chlorophyll in the tropical Pacific. We use the low-complexity RDA model
to investigate the scale-relationships in the impact of different drivers (turbulent diffusion,
mean and eddy advection, primary productivity) on the phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations.
We find that in the 1/4{\deg} (~25km) model, advection has a substantial impact on the rate of primary
productivity, whilst the turbulent diffusion term has a fairly negligible impact. Turbulent diffusion
has an impact on the phytoplankton variability, with the impact being scale-propagated and amplified
by the larger scale surface currents. We investigate the impact of a surface nutrient decline and
some changes to mesoscale eddy kinetic energy (climate change projections) on the surface phytoplankton
concentrations. The RDA model suggests that unless mesoscale eddies radically change, phytoplankton
chlorophyll scales sub-linearly with the nutrients, and it is relatively stable with respect to
the nutrient concentrations. Furthermore we explore how a white multiplicative Gaussian noise
introduced into the RDA model on its resolution scale propagates across spatial scales through
the non-linear model dynamics under different sets of phytoplankton drivers. The unifying message
of this work is that the low complexity (e.g. RDA) models can be successfully used to realistically
model some specific aspects of marine ecosystem dynamics and by using those models one can explore
many questions that would be beyond computational affordability of the higher-complexity ecosystem
models.

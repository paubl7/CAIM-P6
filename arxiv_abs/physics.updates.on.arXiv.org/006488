To simulate the propagation of ocean waves and their interaction with structures, coupling approaches
between a potential flow model and a viscous model are investigated. The aim is to apply each model
at the scale where it is most appropriate and to optimize the computational resources. This first
model is a fully nonlinear potential flow (FNPF) model based on the Harmonic Polynomial Cell (HPC)
method, highly accurate for representing long distance wave propagation and diffraction effects
due to the presence of the structure. The second model is a viscous CFD code, solving the Reynolds-Averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations within the OpenFOAM toolkit, more suited to represent viscous
and turbulent effects in the body's vicinity. Two one-way coupling strategies are developed and
compared. A domain decomposition (DD) strategy is first considered, introducing a refined mesh
in the body vicinity on which the RANS equations are solved. The second coupling strategy considers
a functional decomposition (FD) on the local grid. As the FNPF simulation provides fields of variables
satisfying the irrotational Euler equations, complementary velocity and pressure components
are introduced as the difference between the total flow variables and the potential ones. Those
complementary variables are solutions of modified RANS equations. Extensive comparisons are
presented for nonlinear waves interacting with a fixed horizontal submerged cylinder of rectangular
cross-section. The loads exerted on the body computed from the four simulation methods (standalone
FNPF, standalone CFD, DD and FD coupling schemes) are compared with experimental data. It is shown
that both coupling approaches produce an accurate representation of the loads and associated hydrodynamic
coefficients over a large range of incident wave steepness for a small fraction of the computational
needed by the complete CFD simulation.

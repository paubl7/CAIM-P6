The objective of the present study is to develop a basic understanding of the interaction of shock
waves with density inhomogeneities. We consider here the particular instance of a planar air shock
impinging on a spherical water-droplet and discuss to what extent this interaction can lead to the
inception of cavitation inside the droplet. The effort centers on the early phases of the interaction
process during which the geometry and amplitude of the propagating wavefront is modified by refraction
and the subsequent internal reflections at the droplet interface. The problem is analysed using
both simple ray theory and a 2-D multiphase, compressible hydrodynamic code (ECOGEN). Within the
context of ray theory, the occurrence of focusing is examined in details and parametric equations
are derived for the transmitted wavefront and its multiple internal reflections. It is found that
wave patterns predicted by ray calculations compare extremely well with the more accurate numerical
solutions from simulations. In particular, it is shown that the internal wavefront assumes a complex
time-dependent shape whose dominant feature is the existence of cusp singularities. These singular
points are shown to trace out surfaces that are the caustics of the associated system of rays. From
the singularities of the energy flux density of the refracted wave, the parametric equations of
the caustic surface associated to the $k$-th reflected wavefront are deduced. As a consequence
of the focusing process, the simulations show the formation of negative-pressure regions in the
internal flow field. These low-pressure zones are identified as possible spots where cavitation
may occur, depending on the magnitude of the pressure reached. Finally, the numerical results provide
quantitative information on the dependence of negative pressure peak upon incident-shock-wave
strength.

Harrigan and Spekkens (2010) provided a categorization of quantum ontological models classifying
them as $\psi$-ontic or $\psi$-epistemic if the quantum state describes respectively either a
physical reality or mere observers' knowledge. Moreover, they claimed that Einstein - who was a
supporter of the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics - endorsed an epistemic view
of $\psi$. In this essay we critically assess such a classification and some of its consequences
by proposing a two-fold argumentation. Firstly, we show that Harrigan and Spekkens' categorization
implicitly assumes that a complete description of a quantum system (its ontic state, $\lambda$)
only concerns single, individual systems instantiating absolute, intrinsic properties. Secondly,
we argue that such assumptions conflict with some current interpretations of quantum mechanics,
which employ different ontic states as a complete description of quantum systems. In particular,
we will show that, since in the statistical interpretation ontic states describe ensembles rather
than individuals, such a view cannot be considered psi-epistemic. As a consequence, the authors
misinterpreted Einstein's view concerning the nature of the quantum state. Next, we will focus
on Relationalist Quantum Mechanics and Perspectival Quantum Mechanics, which in virtue of their
relational and perspectival metaphysics employ ontic states lambda dealing with relational properties.
We conclude that Harrigan and Spekkens' categorization is too narrow and entails an inadequate
classification of the mentioned interpretations of quantum theory. Hence, any satisfactory classification
of quantum ontological models ought to take into account the variations of $\lambda$ across different
interpretations of quantum mechanics.

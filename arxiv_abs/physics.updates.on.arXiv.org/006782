In global efforts to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector, novel bio-hybrid
liquid fuels from renewable energy and carbon sources can be a major form of energy for future propulsion
systems due to their high energy density. A fundamental understanding of the spray and mixing performance
of the new fuel candidates in combustion systems is necessary to design and develop the fuels for
advanced combustion concepts. In the fuel design process, a large number of candidates is required
to be screened to arrive at potential fuels for further detailed investigations. For such a screening
process, three-dimensional (3D) simulation models are computationally too expensive and hence
unfeasible. Therefore, in this paper, we present a fast, reduced-order model (ROM) for inert sprays.
The model is based on the cross-sectionally averaged spray (CAS) model derived by Wan (1997) from
3D multiphase equations. The original model was first tested against a wide range of conditions
and different fuels. The discrepancies between the CAS model and experimental data are addressed
by integrating state-of-the-art breakup and evaporation models. A transport equation for vapor
mass fraction is proposed, which is important for evaporation modeling. Furthermore, the model
is extended to consider polydisperse droplets by modeling the droplet size distribution by commonly
used presumed probability density functions, such as Rosin-Rammler, lognormal, and gamma distributions.
The improved CAS model is capable of predicting trends in the macroscopic spray characteristics
for a wide range of conditions and fuels. The computational cost of the CAS model is lower than the
3D simulation methods by up to 6 orders of magnitude depending on the method. This enables the model
to be used not only for the rapid screening of novel fuel candidates, but also for other applications,
where ROMs are useful.

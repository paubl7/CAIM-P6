Multicomponent methods seek to treat select nuclei, typically protons, fully quantum mechanically
and equivalent to the electrons of a chemical system. In such methods, it is well known that due to
the neglect of electron-proton correlation, a Hartree-Fock (HF) description of the electron-proton
interaction catastrophically fails leading to qualitatively incorrect protonic properties.
However, the precise nature of the electron-proton correlation remains poorly understood. It
has long been assumed that dynamic electron-proton correlation is essential for accurate protonic
densities even when a multicomponent complete active space (CAS) space is used. While a multicomponent
CAS self-consistent field (CASSCF) method was implemented nearly twenty years ago, it is only able
to perform calculations with very small active spaces (~105 multicomponent configurations) such
that this assumption has never been accurately tested. Therefore, to better understand the nature
of electron-proton correlation in multicomponent systems, this study derives and implements
a new two-step multicomponent CASSCF method that uses multicomponent heat-bath configuration
interaction for the configuration interaction step, enabling calculations with very large active
spaces (up to 16 electrons in 48 orbitals). We find that large electronic active spaces are needed
to obtain qualitatively accurate protonic densities for the HCN and FHF-molecules. Using this
fact, combined with the recent success of other multicomponent orbital-optimized methods, we
confirm the earlier hypothesis that once a suitable set of reference orbitals is found, dynamic
electron-proton correlation is as essential for accurate protonic properties as dynamic electron-electron
correlation for accurate electronic properties in single-component quantum chemistry.

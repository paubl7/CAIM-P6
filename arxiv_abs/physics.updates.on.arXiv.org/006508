It is economical to devise ways and means to simplify a multi-species particle system. The single
fluid MHD description of a plasma is sufficiently adequate to study plasma phenomena . A plasma containing
multi-species of particles can also be described by representing each particle species by the corresponding
fluid. A partially ionized plasma consisting of electrons, ions and the neutral particles can be
described as a single fluid by appropriately combining the dynamics of each of the species. The three
component plasma can also be reduced to a two-fluid system. The most obvious way is to combine the
electron and the ion fluids to obtain a single fluid in the MHD limit and the neutral particles to form
the second fluid. The other two possibilities are 1) to combine electron fluid and the neutral fluid
into one fluid, here, christened as ENe fluid, and treat the ions as the second fluid and 2) to combine
the ion fluid and the neutral fluid into one fluid, here, christened as INe fluid, and treat the electrons
as the second fluid. It is found that the process of combining the electrons and the neutrals endows
the neutrals with a negative electric charge. So, here is a new plasma with heavy ( with mass of the
neutral particle assuming the electron mass to be negligible) negatively charged particles along
with the positively charged ions. One could in principle, similarly treat the second possibility.
However , since there can be a huge variation between the relative masses of the neutrals and the ions,
the system turns out to be more complex and its discussion is deferred until later. Here, after establishing
the framework for the two-fluid ENe-Ion system, the characteristic electrostatic wave mode of
this novel two-fluid plasma is determined. The wave frequency is found to be a function of the collision
frequencies in addition to the dependence on usual parameters.

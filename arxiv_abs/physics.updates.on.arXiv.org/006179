Mars northern polar latitudes are known to harbor an enhanced 3 ${\mu}$m spectral signature when
observed from orbit. This may indicate a greater amount of surface adsorbed or bound water, although
it has not yet been possible to easily reconcile orbital observations with ground measurements
by Phoenix. Here we reprocessed OMEGA/Mars Express observations acquired during the Northern
summer to further characterize this 3 ${\mu}$m absorption band increase. We identify the presence
of a new specific spectral signature composed of an additional narrow absorption feature centered
at 3.03 ${\mu}$m coupled with an absorption at ${\lambda}$ ${\geq}$ 3.8 ${\mu}$m. This signature
is homogeneously distributed over a bright albedo open ring surrounding the circumpolar low-albedo
terrains between ~ 68{\deg}N and 76{\deg}N and ~ 0{\deg}E and 270{\deg}E. This location includes
the Phoenix landing site. This feature shows no time variability and can be confidently attributed
to a seasonally stable surface component. All together, the stability, spectral shape and absence
of significant correlation with other signatures in the 1 $-$ 2.5 ${\mu}$m range discard interpretations
relying on water ice or easily exchangeable adsorbed water. The exact full spectral shape cannot
be easily reproduced by pure minerals samples, although sulfates, notably lowly hydrated Ca-sulfates,
provide interesting comparisons. A modification of the chemical or physical properties of the
soil, potentially involving additional sulfates contaminants, or modification of the hydration
state of sulfates, and/or modification of their grains size, seems a plausible explanation to this
observation, which may then indicate geologically recent water alteration at high northern latitudes.

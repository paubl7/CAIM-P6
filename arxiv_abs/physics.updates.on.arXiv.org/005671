The interaction between shear driven turbulence and stratification is a key process in a wide array
of geophysical flows with spatio-temporal scales that span many orders of magnitude. A quick numerical
model prediction based on external parameters of stratified boundary layers could greatly benefit
the understanding of the interaction between velocity and scalar flux at varying scales. For these
reasons, here, we use the resolvent framework to investigate the effects of an active scalar on incompressible
wall-bounded turbulence. We obtain the state of the flow system by applying the linear resolvent
operator to the nonlinear terms in the governing Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation.
This extends the formulation to include the scalar advection equation with the scalar component
acting in the wall-normal direction in the momentum equations. We use the mean velocity profiles
from a DNS of a stably-stratified turbulent channel flow at varying friction Richardson number.
The results obtained from the resolvent analysis are compared to the premultiplied energy spectra,
auto-correlation coefficient, and the energy budget terms obtained from the DNS. It is shown that
despite using only a very limited range of representative scales, the resolvent model is able to
reproduce the balance of energy budget terms as well as provide meaningful insight of coherent structures
occurring in the flow. Computation of the leading resolvent models, despite considering a limited
range of scales, reproduces the balance of energy budget terms, provides meaningful predictions
of coherent structures in the flow, and is more cost-effective than performing full-scale simulations.
This quick model can provide further understanding of stratified flows with only information about
the mean profile and prior knowledge of energetic scales of motion in the neutrally-buoyant boundary
layers.

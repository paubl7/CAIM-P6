In soft-collinear effective theory, we analyze the structure of rapidity divergence due to the
collinear and soft modes residing in disparate phase spaces. The idea of an effective theory is applied
to a system of collinear modes with large rapidity and soft modes with small rapidity. The large-rapidity
(collinear) modes are integrated out to obtain the effective theory for the small-rapidity (soft)
modes. The full SCET with the collinear and soft modes should be matched onto the soft theory at the
rapidity boundary, and the matching procedure becomes exactly the zero-bin subtraction. The large-rapidity
region is out of reach for the soft mode, which results in the rapidity divergence. The rapidity divergence
in the collinear sector comes from the zero-bin subtraction, which ensures the cancellation of
the rapidity divergences from the soft and collinear sectors. In order to treat the rapidity divergence,
we construct the rapidity regulators consistently for all the modes. They are generalized by assigning
independent rapidity scales for different collinear directions. The soft regulator incorporates
the correct directional dependence when the innate collinear directions are not back-to-back,
which is discussed in the $N$-jet operator. As an application, we consider the Sudakov form factor
for the back-to-back collinear current and the soft-collinear current, where the soft rapidity
regulator for a soft quark is developed. We extend the analysis to the boosted heavy quark sector
and exploit the delicacy with the presence of the heavy quark mass. We present the resummed results
of large logarithms in the form factors for various currents with the light and the heavy quarks,
employing the renormalization group evolution on the renormalization and the rapidity scales.

We present a calculation of the pion and kaon Mellin moment $\langle x^3 \rangle$ extracted directly
in lattice QCD using a three-derivative local operator. We use one ensemble of gauge configurations
with two degenerate light, a strange and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$) of maximally twisted mass fermions
with clover improvement. The ensemble reproduces a pion mass $\sim260$ MeV, and a kaon mass $\sim530$
MeV. Excited-states contamination is evaluated using four values of the source-sink time separation
within the range of $1.12-1.67$ fm. We use an operator that is free of mixing, and apply a multiplicative
renormalization function calculated non-perturbatively. Our results are converted to the $\overline{\rm
MS}$ scheme and evolved at a scale of 2 GeV, using three-loop expressions in perturbation theory.
The final values are $\langle x^3 \rangle_\pi^{u^+}=0.024(18)_{\rm stat}(2)_{\rm syst}$, $\langle
x^3 \rangle_K^{u^+}=0.035(6)_{\rm stat}(3)_{\rm syst}$, and $\langle x^3 \rangle_K^{s^+}=0.075(5)_{\rm
stat}(1)_{\rm syst}$, where the systematic error is the uncertainty due to excited state contamination.
We combine $\langle x^3 \rangle$ with the two lower moments to obtain the ratios $\langle x^3 \rangle/\langle
x \rangle$ and $\langle x^3 \rangle/\langle x^2 \rangle$, as well as ratios between the pion and
kaon moments. In addition, we reconstruct the $x$-dependence of the pion and kaon PDFs via 2- and
3-parameter fits to our results. We find that the reconstruction is feasible and that our lattice
data favor a large $x$-dependence that falls as $(1-x)^2$ for both the pion and kaon PDFs. We integrate
the reconstructed PDFs to extract the higher moments with $4\leq n\leq 6$. Finally, we compare the
pion and kaon PDFs, as well as the ratios of their moments, to address the effect of SU(3) flavor symmetry
breaking.

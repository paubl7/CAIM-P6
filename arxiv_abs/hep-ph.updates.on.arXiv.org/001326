Jet interactions in a hot QCD medium created in heavy-ion collisions are conventionally assessed
by measuring the modification of the distributions of jet observables with respect to the proton-proton
baseline. However, the steeply falling production spectrum introduces a strong bias toward small
energy losses that obfuscates a direct interpretation of the impact of medium effects in the measured
jet ensemble. Modern machine learning techniques offer the potential to tackle this issue on a jet-by-jet
basis. In this paper, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to diagnose such modifications
from jet images where the training and validation is performed using the hybrid strong/weak coupling
model. By analyzing measured jets in heavy-ion collisions, we extract the original jet transverse
momentum, i.e., the transverse momentum of an identical jet that did not pass through a medium, in
terms of an energy loss ratio. Despite many sources of fluctuations, we achieve good performance
and put emphasis on the interpretability of our results. We observe that the angular distribution
of soft particles in the jet cone and their relative contribution to the total jet energy contain
significant discriminating power, which can be exploited to tailor observables that provide a
good estimate of the energy loss ratio. With a well-predicted energy loss ratio, we study a set of
jet observables to estimate their sensitivity to bias effects and reveal their medium modifications
when compared to a more equivalent jet population, i.e., a set of jets with similar initial energy.
Finally, we also show the potential of deep learning techniques in the analysis of the geometrical
aspects of jet quenching such as the in-medium traversed length or the position of the hard scattering
in the transverse plane, opening up new possibilities for tomographic studies.

Our first aim is to explore the effect of the collision integral with the insurance of instantaneous
conservation of particle number on charge and heat transport in a thermal QCD medium. The second
aim is to see how the dimensional reduction due to strong magnetic field (B) modulates the transport
through the entangled effects, {\em such as} collision-time and occupation probability etc. in
collision integral. The final aim is to check how the quasiparticle description through dispersion
relation of thermal QCD in strong B, alters the aforesaid conclusions. We observe that modified
collision term expedites both transport, which is manifested by large magnitudes of electrical
($\sigma_{\rm el}$) and thermal ($\kappa$) conductivities, in comparison to relaxation-collision
term. As a corollary, Lorenz number is dominated by the later and Knudsen number is by the former.
However, strong B not only flips the dominance of collision term in heat transport, it also causes
drastic enhancement of both $\sigma_{\rm el}$ and $\kappa$ and reduction in specific heat. As a
result, the equilibration factor, Knudsen number becomes much larger than one, which defies physical
interpretation. Finally, quasiparticle description in the absence of strong B impedes the transport
of charge and heat, resulting in the meagre decrease of conductivities, however, strong B does noticeable
observations: conductivities now gets reduced to physically plausible values, T-dependence
of $\sigma_{\rm el}$ gets reversed, {\em i.e.} it now decreases with T, effect of collision integral
gets smeared in $\kappa$ etc. Knudsen number thus becomes much smaller than one, implying that the
system be remained in equilibrium. These findings attribute to the fact that the collective modes
in the dispersion relation of thermal QCD in strong B sets in much larger scale, manifested by large
in-medium masses.

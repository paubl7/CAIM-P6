The observation of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ by the LHCb collaboration adds a new member to the set of known
hidden-charm pentaquarks, which includes the $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$. The
$P_{cs}(4459)$ is expected to have the light-quark content of a $\Lambda$ baryon ($I=0$, $S=-1$),
but its spin is unknown. Being close to the $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$ threshold -- $4478\,{\rm MeV}$ in the
isospin-symmetric limit -- the molecular hypothesis readily comes to mind as a plausible explanation
for this state. Here we explore the possible relations of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ with the other known
$P_c$ pentaquarks. SU(3)-flavor and heavy-quark symmetries suggest the existence of nearby $\bar{D}
\Xi_c'$ and $\bar{D} \Xi_c^*$ pentaquarks, which we might call $P_{cs}'(4437)$ and $P_{cs}^*(4504)$
in reference to their expected masses. But the $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$ system is not related to the $P_c$'s
in terms of neither of these two symmetries and we will have to resort to phenomenology instead. If
we assume light-meson ($\sigma$, $\rho$ and $\omega$) exchange saturation of the contact-range
couplings of an effective field theory describing the $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$, $\bar{D} \Xi_c'$ and
$\bar{D} \Xi_c^*$ molecules, we will be able to predict the existence of $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$ pentaquarks.
The mass of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ will depend on its spin, with concrete calculations yielding $4460-4480\,{\rm
MeV}$ and $4442-4473\,{\rm MeV}$ for $J = \tfrac{1}{2}$ and $J=\tfrac{3}{2}$, respectively.
Thus spectroscopy suggests a marginal preference for $J = \tfrac{3}{2}$ (over $J = \tfrac{1}{2}$).
The decay of a molecular $P_{cs}(4459)$ into $J/\psi \Lambda$ (i.e. where it has been observed)
is expected to be four times larger for the $J=\tfrac{3}{2}$ configuration than the $J=\tfrac{1}{2}$
one, also favoring the $J = \tfrac{3}{2}$ interpretation if production rates happen to be similar.

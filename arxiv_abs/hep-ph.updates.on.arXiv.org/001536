We study supersymmetric (SUSY) effects on $C_7(\mu_b)$ and $C'_7(\mu_b)$ which are the Wilson
coefficients (WCs) for $b \to s \gamma$ at b-quark mass scale $\mu_b$ and are closely related to radiative
$B$-meson decays. The SUSY-loop contributions to $C_7(\mu_b)$ and $C'_7(\mu_b)$ are calculated
at leading order (LO) in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with general quark-flavour
violation (QFV). For the first time we perform a systematic MSSM parameter scan for the WCs $C_7(\mu_b)$
and $C'_7(\mu_b)$ respecting all the relevant constraints, i.e. the theoretical constraints
from vacuum stability conditions and the experimental constraints, such as those from $K$- and
$B$-meson data and electroweak precision data, as well as recent limits on SUSY particle masses
and the 125 GeV Higgs boson data from LHC experiments. From the parameter scan we find the following:
(1) The MSSM contribution to Re($C_7(\mu_b)$) can be as large as $\sim \pm 0.05$, which could correspond
to about 3$\sigma$ significance of New Physics (NP) signal in the future LHCb and Belle II experiments.
(2) The MSSM contribution to Re($C'_7(\mu_b)$) can be as large as $\sim -0.08$, which could correspond
to about 4$\sigma$ significance of NP signal in the future LHCb and Belle II experiments. (3) These
large MSSM contributions to the WCs are mainly due to (i) large scharm-stop mixing and large scharm/stop
involved trilinear couplings, (ii) large sstrange-sbottom mixing and large sstrange-sbottom
involved trilinear couplings and (iii) large bottom Yukawa coupling $Y_b$ for large $\tan\beta$
and large top Yukawa coupling $Y_t$. In case such large NP contributions to the WCs are really observed
in the future experiments at Belle II and LHCb Upgrade, this could be the imprint of QFV SUSY (the MSSM
with general QFV).

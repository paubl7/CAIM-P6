We study the antikaon-induced inclusive cascade $\Xi^-$ hyperon production from $^{12}$C and
$^{184}$W target nuclei near threshold within a nuclear spectral function approach. The approach
describes incoherent direct $\Xi^-$ hyperon production in elementary ${K^-}p \to {K^+}\Xi^-$
and ${K^-}n \to {K^0}\Xi^-$ processes as well as takes into account the influence of the scalar nuclear
$K^-$, $K^+$, $K^0$, $\Xi^-$ and their Coulomb potentials on these processes. We calculate the
absolute differential and total cross sections for the production of $\Xi^-$ hyperons off these
nuclei at laboratory angles $\le$ 45$^{\circ}$ by $K^-$ mesons with momenta of 1.0 and 1.3 GeV/c,
which are close to the threshold momentum (1.05 GeV/c) for $\Xi^-$ hyperon production on the free
target nucleon at rest. We also calculate the momentum dependence of the transparency ratio for
the $^{184}$W/$^{12}$C combination for $\Xi^-$ hyperons at these $K^-$ beam momenta. We show that
the $\Xi^-$ differential and total (absolute and relative) production cross sections at the considered
initial momenta reveal a distinct sensitivity to the variations in the scalar $\Xi^-$ nuclear potential
at saturation density $\rho_0$, studied in the paper, in the low-momentum region of 0.1--0.6 GeV/c.
We also demonstrate that for the subthreshold $K^-$ meson momentum of 1.0 GeV/c there is a strong
sensitivity of the transparency ratio for $\Xi^-$ hyperons to the considered changes in the $\Xi^-$
nuclear potential at all outgoing $\Xi^-$ momenta as well. Therefore, the measurement of these
absolute and relative observables in a dedicated experiment at the J-PARC will provide valuable
information on the $\Xi^-$ in-medium properties, which will be complementary to that deduced from
the study of the inclusive ($K^-$,$K^+$) reactions at incident momenta of 1.6--1.8 GeV/c in the
$\Xi^-$ bound and quasi-free regions.

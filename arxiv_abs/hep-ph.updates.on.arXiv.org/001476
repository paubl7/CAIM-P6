The recent measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment by the Fermilab E989 experiment, when
combined with the previous result at BNL, has confirmed the tension with the SM prediction at $4.2\,\sigma$~CL,
strengthening the motivation for new physics in the leptonic sector. Among the different particle
physics models that could account for such an excess, a gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_{\tau}}$ stands
out for its simplicity, but it is yet indistinguishable from other constructions with a muon-philic
vector boson, such as a simplified $U(1)_{L_\mu}$ model. In this article, we explore how the combination
of data from different future probes can help identify the nature of the new physics behind the muon
anomalous magnetic moment. We first show that muon fixed target experiments (such as NA64$\mu$)
will be able to measure the coupling of the hidden photon to the muon sector in the region compatible
with $(g-2)_\mu$, and will have some sensitivity to the hidden photon's mass. We then study how experiments
looking for coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) at spallation sources
will provide crucial additional information on the kinetic mixing of the hidden photon. When combined
with NA64$\mu$ results, the exclusion limits (or reconstructed regions) of future CE$\nu$NS detectors
will also allow for a better measurement of the mediator mass. Finally, the observation of nuclear
recoils from solar neutrinos in dark matter direct detection experiments will provide unique information
about the coupling of the hidden photon to the tau sector. The signal expected for $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_{\tau}}$
is larger than for $U(1)_{L_\mu}$ with the same kinetic mixing, and future multi-ton liquid xenon
proposals (such as DARWIN) have the potential to separate both models.

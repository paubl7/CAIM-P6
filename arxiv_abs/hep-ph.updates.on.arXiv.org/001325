Spectral distortions (SDs) of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a powerful tool for
studying particle physics. Here we compute the distortion signals from decaying particles that
convert directly into photons at different epochs during cosmic history, focusing on injection
energies $E_\mathrm{inj}\lesssim 20\,\mathrm{keV}$. We deliver a comprehensive library of
SD solutions that can be used to study a wide range of particle physics scenarios. We use {\tt CosmoTherm}
to compute the SD signals, including effects on the ionization history and opacities of the Universe.
We also consider the effect of blackbody-induced stimulated decay, which can modify the injection
history significantly. Then, we use data from COBE/FIRAS and EDGES to constrain the properties
of the decaying particles. We explore scenarios where these provide a dark matter (DM) candidate
or constitute only a small fraction of DM. We complement the SD constraints with CMB anisotropy constraints,
highlighting new effects from injections at very-low photon energies ($h\nu\lesssim 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{eV}$).
Our model-independent constraints exhibit rich structures in the lifetime-energy domain, covering
injection energies $E_\mathrm{inj}\simeq 10^{-10}\mathrm{eV}-10\mathrm{keV}$ and lifetimes
$\tau_X\simeq 10^5\,\mathrm{s}-10^{33}\mathrm{s}$. We discuss the constraints on axions and
axion-like particles that convert directly into two photons, revising existing SD constraints
in the literature. Our limits are competitive with other constraints for axion masses $m_a c^2\gtrsim
27\,\mathrm{eV}$ and we find that simple estimates based on the overall energetics are generally
inaccurate. Future CMB spectrometers could significantly improve the obtained constraints,
thus providing an important complementary probe of early-universe particle physics.

We present a case study for the doubly charged Higgs bosons $H^{\pm\pm}$ pair production in $e^+e^-$
and $pp$ colliders with their subsequent decays to four charged leptons. We consider the Higgs Triplet
Model (\texttt{HTM}) not restricted by the custodial symmetry and the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric
Model (\texttt{MLRSM}). The models include scalar triplets with different complexity of scalar
potentials and, due to experimental restrictions, completely different scales of non-standard
triplet vacuum expectation values. In both models, a doubly charged Higgs boson $H^{\pm\pm}$ can
acquire a mass of hundreds of gigaelectronvolts, which can be probed at HL-LHC, future $e^+e^-$,
and hadron colliders. We find that after taking into account the constraints on the parameters of
the models coming from neutrino oscillations, LHC, $e^+e^-$ and low-energy lepton flavour violating
data, for the same mass of $H^{\pm\pm}$, the $H^{\pm\pm}$ pair production in lepton and hadron colliders
is comparable in both models. However, decay branching ratios can be different, leading to distinguishable
four lepton final signatures. Setting model parameters to maximise the $4e$ and $4\mu$ signals
separately, after suitable kinematic cuts, the maximal possible signals for the process $pp \to
H^{++} H^{--} \to 4l$ are connected with detection of four muon events in \texttt{MLRSM}. Typically,
it exceeds the \texttt{HTM} signal by one order of magnitude for $M_{H^{++}}=1$ TeV with significance
of the $pp \to 4\mu$ signal $S \simeq 8$ for HL-LHC, and $S \simeq 200$ for FCC-hh. Additionally, we
discuss dilepton invariant mass distributions and leptons separations which can be useful in the
identification of non-standard signals.

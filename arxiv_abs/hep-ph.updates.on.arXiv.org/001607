We demonstrate that the reformulation of renormalization group (RG) flow equations as non-linear
heat equations has severe implications on the understanding of RG flows in general. We demonstrate
by explicitly constructing an entropy function for a zero-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric
model that the dissipative character of generic non-linear diffusion equations is also hard-coded
in the functional RG equation. This renders RG flows manifestly irreversible, revealing the semi-group
property of RG transformations on the level of the flow equation itself. Additionally, we argue
that the dissipative character of RG flows, its irreversibility and the entropy production during
the RG flow may be linked to the existence of a so-called $\mathcal{C}$-/$\mathcal{A}$-function.
In total, this introduces an asymmetry in the so-called RG time -- in complete analogy to the thermodynamic
arrow of time -- and allows for an interpretation of infrared actions as equilibrium solutions of
dissipative RG flows equations. The impossibility of resolving microphysics from macrophysics
is evident in this framework. Furthermore, we directly link the irreversibility and the entropy
production in RG flows to an explicit numerical entropy production, which is manifest in diffusive
and non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) and a standard mathematical tool for the
analysis of PDEs. Using exactly solvable zero-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric models,
we explicitly compute the (numerical) entropy production related to the total variation non-increasing
property of the PDE during RG flows towards the infrared limit. Finally, we discuss generalizations
of our findings and relations to the $\mathcal{C}$-/$\mathcal{A}$-theorem as well as how our work
may help to construct truncations of RG flow equations in the future, including numerically stable
schemes for solving the corresponding PDEs.

Large angle gluon radiations induced by multiple parton scatterings contribute to dijet production
in deeply inelastic scattering off a large nucleus at the Electron-Ion Collider. Within the generalized
high-twist approach to multiple parton scattering, such contributions at the leading order in
perturbative QCD and large Bjorken momentum fraction $x_B$ can be expressed as a convolution of
the multiple parton scattering amplitudes and the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) two-parton
correlation matrix elements. We study this medium-induced dijet spectrum and its azimuthal angle
correlation under the approximation of small longitudinal momentum transfer in the secondary
scattering and the factorization of two-parton correlation matrix elements as a product of quark
and gluon TMD parton distribution function (PDF). Using a simple model for gluon saturation based
on the parametrized gluon TMD PDF, we can calculate the $x_B$ and $Q^2$ dependence of the saturation
scale and parton transport coefficient $\hat q$. Contributions to dijet cross section from double
scattering are power-suppressed and only become sizable for mini-jets at small transverse momentum.
We find that the total dijet correlation for these mini-jets, which also includes the contribution
from single scattering, is sensitive to the transverse momentum broadening in the quark TMD PDF
at large $x$ and saturation in the gluon TMD PDF at small $x$ inside the nucleus. The correlation from
double scattering is also found to increase with the dijet rapidity gap and have a quadratic nuclear-size
dependence because of the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) interference in gluon emission induced
by multiple scattering. Experimental measurements of such unique features in the dijet correlation
can shed light on the LPM interference in strong interaction and gluon saturation in large nuclei.

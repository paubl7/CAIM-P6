Upon embedding the axion-inflation in the minimal left-right symmetric gauge extension of the
SM with gauge group $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$, [arXiv:2012.11516] proposed
a new particle physics model for inflation. In this work, we present a more detailed analysis. As
a compelling consequence, this setup provides a new mechanism for simultaneous baryogenesis and
right-handed neutrino creation by the chiral anomaly of $W_R$ in inflation. The lightest right-handed
neutrino is the dark matter candidate. This setup has two unknown fundamental scales, i.e., the
scale of inflation and left-right symmetry breaking $SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}\rightarrow U(1)_{Y}$.
Sufficient matter creation demands the left-right symmetry breaking scale happens shortly after
the end of inflation. Interestingly, it prefers left-right symmetry breaking scales above $10^{10}~GeV$,
which is in the range suggested by the non-supersymmetric SO(10) Grand Unified Theory with an intermediate
left-right symmetry scale. Although $W_R$ gauge field generates equal amounts of right-handed
baryons and leptons in inflation, i.e. $B-L=0$, in the Standard Model sub-sector $B-L_{SM}\neq
0$. A key aspect of this setup is that $SU(2)_R$ sphalerons are never in equilibrium, and the primordial
$B-L_{SM}$ is conserved by the Standard Model interactions. This setup yields a deep connection
between CP violation in physics of inflation and matter creation (visible and dark); hence it can
naturally explain the observed coincidences among cosmological parameters, i.e., $\eta_{B}\simeq
0.3 P_{\zeta}$ and $\Omega_{DM}\simeq 5\Omega_{B}$. The $SU(2)_R$-axion inflation comes with
a cosmological smoking gun; chiral, non-Gaussian, and blue-tilted gravitational wave background,
which can be probed by future CMB missions and laser interferometer detectors.

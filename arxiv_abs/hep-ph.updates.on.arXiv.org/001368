We present a global analysis of the observed Z_c, Z_cs and future Z_css-like spectra using the inverse
Laplace transform (LSR) version of QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR) within stability criteria. Integrated
compact QCD expressions of the LO spectral functions up to dimension-six condensates are given.
Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) factorized perturbative contributions are included. We re-emphasize
the importance to include PT radiative corrections (though numerically small) for heavy quark
sum rules in order to justify the (ad hoc) definition and value of the heavy quark mass used frequently
at LO in the literature. We also demonstrate that, contrary to a na\"ive qualitative 1/N_c counting,
the two-meson scattering contributions to the four-quark spectral functions are numerically
negligible confirming the reliability of the LSR predictions. Our results are summarized in Tables
III to VI. The Z_c(3900) and Z_cs(3983) spectra are well reproduced by the T_c(3900) and T_cs(3973)
tetramoles (superposition of quasi-degenerated molecules and tetraquark states having the same
quantum numbers and with almost equal couplings to the currents). The Z_c(4025) or Z_c(4040) state
can be fitted with the D*_0D_1 molecule having a mass 4023(130) MeV while the Z_cs bump around 4.1
GeV can be likely due to the (D^*_s0D_1+ D^*_0D_s1) molecules. The Z_c(4430) can be a radial excitation
of the Z_c(3900) weakly coupled to the current, while all strongly coupled ones are in the region
(5634-6527) MeV. The double strange tetramole state T_css which one may identify with the future
Z_css is predicted to be at 4064(46) MeV. It is remarkable to notice the regular mass-spliitings
of the tetramoles due to SU(3) breakings M_{T_cs}-M_{T_c}= M_{T_css}-M_{T_cs= (73- 91) MeV.

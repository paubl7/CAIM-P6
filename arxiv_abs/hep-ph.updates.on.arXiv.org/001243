We have studied the effect of strong magnetic field on the viscous properties of hot QCD matter at
finite chemical potential by calculating the shear ($\eta$) and bulk ($\zeta$) viscosities. The
viscosities are calculated using kinetic theory in the relaxation time approximation. The interactions
are incorporated through the quasiparticle masses of partons at strong magnetic field and finite
chemical potential. From this study, one can understand the effects of strong magnetic field and
chemical potential on the sound attenuation through the Prandtl number (Pl), on the nature of the
flow by the Reynolds number (Rl), and on the relative behavior between shear viscosity and bulk viscosity
through the ratio $\zeta/\eta$. We have found that, $\eta$ and $\zeta$ get increased in a strong
magnetic field and the additional presence of chemical potential further enhances their magnitudes.
With the increase of temperature, $\eta$ increases in a strong magnetic field as well as in the absence
of magnetic field, whereas $\zeta$ decreases with the temperature, contrary to its increase in
the absence of magnetic field. We have observed that, the Prandtl number gets increased in the presence
of strong magnetic field and chemical potential as compared to the isotropic one, but it always remains
larger than 1, thus the momentum diffusion largely affects the sound attenuation in the medium.
The Reynolds number gets lowered than 1 in a strong magnetic field and it becomes further decreased
in an additional presence of chemical potential, so the kinematic viscosity dominates over the
characteristic length scale of the system. Finally, $\zeta/\eta$ becomes larger than 1, contrary
to its value in the absence of magnetic field and chemical potential where it is less than 1, so the
bulk viscosity prevails over the shear viscosity for the hot and dense QCD matter in the presence
of a strong magnetic field.

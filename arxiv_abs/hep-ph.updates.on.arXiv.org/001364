Quiescent hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray emission from neutron stars constitute a promising frontier
to explore axion-like-particles (ALPs). ALP production in the core peaks at energies of a few keV
to a few hundreds of keV; subsequently, the ALPs escape and convert to photons in the magnetosphere.
The emissivity goes as $\sim T^6$ while the conversion probability is enhanced for large magnetic
fields, making magnetars, with their high core temperatures and strong magnetic fields, ideal
targets for probing ALPs. We compute the energy spectrum of photons resulting from conversion of
ALPs in the magnetosphere and then compare it against hard X-ray data from NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, and
XMM-Newton for a set of eight magnetars for which such data exists. Upper limits are placed on the
product of the ALP-nucleon and ALP-photon couplings. For the production in the core, we perform
a careful calculation of the ALP emissivity in degenerate nuclear matter modeled by a relativistic
mean field theory. The reduction of the emissivity due to improvements to the one-pion exchange
approximation is incorporated, as is the strong suppression of the emissivity due to nucleon superfluidity
in the neutron star core. A range of core temperatures is considered, corresponding to different
models of the steady heat transfer from the core to the stellar surface. Our treatment also includes
the first calculation of the emissivity due to $n+p \rightarrow n+p+a$ processes in the limit of
strongly degenerate nuclear matter. For the subsequent conversion, we solve the coupled differential
equations mixing ALPs and photons in the magnetosphere. The conversion occurs due to a competition
between the dipolar magnetic field and the photon refractive index induced by the external magnetic
field. Semi-analytic expressions are provided alongside the full numerical results.

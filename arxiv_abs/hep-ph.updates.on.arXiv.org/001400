We provide a first systematic and quantitative discussion of the phenomenology of the non-relativistic
effective Hamiltonian describing the nuclear scattering process for a Weakly Interacting Massive
Particle (WIMP) of arbitrary spin $j_\chi$. To this aim we obtain constraints from a representative
sample of present direct detection experiments assuming the WIMP-nucleus scattering process
to be driven by each one of the 44 effective couplings that arise for $j_\chi\le$ 2. We find that a high
value of the multipolarity $s\le 2 j_\chi$ of the coupling, related to the power of the momentum transfer
$q$ appearing in the scattering amplitude, leads to a suppression of the expected rates and pushes
the expected differential spectra to large recoil energies $E_R$. For $s\le$ 4 the effective scales
probed by direct detection experiments can be suppressed by up to 5 orders of magnitude compared
to the case of a standard spin-independent interaction. For operators with large $s$ the expected
differential spectra can be pushed to recoil energies in the MeV range, with the largest part of the
signal concentrated at $E_R\gtrsim$ 100 keV and a peculiar structure of peaks and minima arising
when both the nuclear target and the WIMP are heavy. As a consequence the present bounds on the effective
operators can be significantly improved by extending the recoil energy intervals to higher recoil
energies. Our analysis assumes effective interaction operators that are irreducible under the
rotation group. Such operators drive the interactions of high-multipole dark matter candidates,
i.e. states that possess only the highest multipole allowed by their spin. As a consequence our analysis
represents also the first phenomenological study of the direct detection of quadrupolar, octupolar,
and hexadecapolar dark matter.

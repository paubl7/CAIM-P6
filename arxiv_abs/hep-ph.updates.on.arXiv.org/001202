We consider the decoherence effects in the propagation of active neutrinos due to the non-forward
neutrino scattering processes in a matter background composed of electrons and nucleons. We calculate
the contribution to the imaginary part of the neutrino self-energy arising from such processes.
Since the initial neutrino state is depleted but does not actually disappear (the initial neutrino
transitions into a neutrino of a different flavor but does not decay) those processes should be associated
with decoherence effects that cannot be described in terms of the coherent evolution of the state
vector. Based on the formalism developed in our previous work for treating the non-forward scattering
processes using the notion of the stochastic evolution of the state, we identify the jump operators,
as used in the context of the master or Lindblad equation, in terms of the results of the the calculation
of the non-forward neutrino scattering contribution to the imaginary part of the neutrino self-energy.
As a guide to estimating the decoherence effects in situations of practical interest we give explicit
formulas for the decoherence terms for different background conditions, and point out some of the
salient features in particular the neutrino energy dependence. To establish contact wih previous
works in which the decoherence terms are treated as phenomenological parameters, we consider the
solution to the evolution equation in the two-generation case. We give formulas that are useful
for estimating the effects of the decoherence terms under various conditions and environments,
including the typical conditions applicable to long baseline experiments, where matter effects
are important. In those contexts the effects appear to be small, and indicative that if significant
decoherence effects were to be found they would be due to non-standard contributions to the decoherence
terms.

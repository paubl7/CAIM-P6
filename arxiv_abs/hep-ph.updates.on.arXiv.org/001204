Even though neutrino oscillations have been conclusively established, there are a few unanswered
questions pertaining to leptonic Charge Parity violation (CPV), mass hierarchy (MH) and $\theta_{23}$
octant degeneracy. Addressing these questions is of paramount importance at the current and future
neutrino experiments including the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) which has a baseline
of 1300 km. In the standard mode, DUNE is expected to run with a {\textit{low energy}} (LE) tuned beam
which peaks around the first oscillation maximum ($2-3$ GeV) (and then sharply falls off as we go
to higher energies). However, the wide band nature of the beam available at long baseline neutrino
facility (LBNF) allows for the flexibility in utilizing beam tunes that are well-suited at higher
energies as well. In this work, we utilize a beam that provides high statistics at higher energies
which is referred to as the {\textit{medium energy}} (ME) beam. This opens up the possibility of
exploring not only the usual oscillation channels but also the $\nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{\tau}$ oscillation
channel which was otherwise not accessible. Our goal is to find an optimal combination of beam tune
and runtime (with the total runtime held fixed) distributed in neutrino and antineutrino mode that
leads to an improvement in the sensitivities of these parameters at DUNE. In our analysis, we incorporate
all the three channels ($\nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{e}, \nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{\mu}, \nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{\tau}$)
and develop an understanding of their relative contributions in sensitivities at the level of $\Delta
\chi^2$. Finally, we obtain the preferred combination of runtime using both the beam tunes as well
as neutrino and antineutrino mode that lead to enhanced sensitivity to the current unknowns in neutrino
oscillation physics i.e., CPV, MH and $\theta_{23}$ octant.

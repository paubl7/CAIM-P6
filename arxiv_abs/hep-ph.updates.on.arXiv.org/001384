This is the user manual for CosmoLattice, a modern package for lattice simulations of the dynamics
of interacting scalar and gauge fields in an expanding universe. CosmoLattice incorporates a series
of features that makes it very versatile and powerful: $i)$ it is written in C++ fully exploiting
the object oriented programming paradigm, with a modular structure and a clear separation between
the physics and the technical details, $ii)$ it is MPI-based and uses a discrete Fourier transform
parallelized in multiple spatial dimensions, which makes it specially appropriate for probing
scenarios with well-separated scales, running very high resolution simulations, or simply very
long ones, $iii)$ it introduces its own symbolic language, defining field variables and operations
over them, so that one can introduce differential equations and operators in a manner as close as
possible to the continuum, $iv)$ it includes a library of numerical algorithms, ranging from $O(\delta
t^2)$ to $O(\delta t^{10})$ methods, suitable for simulating global and gauge theories in an expanding
grid, including the case of `self-consistent' expansion sourced by the fields themselves. Relevant
observables are provided for each algorithm (e.g.~energy densities, field spectra, lattice snapshots)
and we note that remarkably all our algorithms for gauge theories always respect the Gauss constraint
to machine precision. In this manual we explain how to obtain and run CosmoLattice in a computer (let
it be your laptop, desktop or a cluster). We introduce the general structure of the code and describe
in detail the basic files that any user needs to handle. We explain how to implement any model characterized
by a scalar potential and a set of scalar fields, either singlets or interacting with $U(1)$ and/or
$SU(2)$ gauge fields. CosmoLattice is publicly available at www.cosmolattice.net.

We perform a model-exhaustive analysis of all possible beyond Standard Model (BSM) solutions to
the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly to study production of the associated new states at future muon colliders,
and formulate a no-lose theorem for the discovery of new physics if the anomaly is confirmed and weakly
coupled solutions below the GeV scale are excluded. Our goal is to find the highest possible mass
scale of new physics subject only to perturbative unitarity, and optionally the requirements of
minimum flavour violation (MFV) and/or naturalness. We prove that a 3 TeV muon collider is guaranteed
to discover all BSM scenarios in which $\Delta a_\mu$ is generated by SM singlets with masses above
$\sim $ GeV; lighter singlets will be discovered by upcoming low-energy experiments. If new states
with electroweak quantum numbers contribute to $(g-2)_\mu$, the minimal requirements of perturbative
unitarity guarantee new charged states below $\mathcal{O}(100 {\rm TeV})$, but this is strongly
disfavoured by stringent constraints on charged lepton flavour violating (CLFV) decays. Reasonable
BSM theories that satisfy CLFV bounds by obeying Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV) and avoid generating
two new hierarchy problems require the existence of at least one new charged state below $\sim 10
- 20$ TeV. This strongly motivates the construction of high-energy muon colliders, which are guaranteed
to discover new physics: either by producing these new charged states directly, or by setting a strong
lower bound on their mass, which would empirically prove that the universe is fine-tuned and violates
the assumptions of MFV while somehow not generating large CLFVs. The former case is obviously the
desired outcome, but the latter scenario would perhaps teach us even more about the universe by profoundly
revising our understanding of naturalness, cosmological vacuum selection, and the SM flavour
puzzle.

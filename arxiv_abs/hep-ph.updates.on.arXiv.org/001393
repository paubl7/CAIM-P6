The nature of the three narrow hidden-charm pentaquark $P_c$ states is under intense discussion
since their discovery from the updated analysis of the process $\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi pK^-$ by
LHCb. In this work we extend our previous coupled-channel approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 072001
(2020)] by including the $\Lambda_c\bar{D}^{(*)}$ and $\eta_cp$ explicitly as required by unitarity
and HQSS, respectively. Three calculation schemes are considered: (a) scheme I with pure contact
interactions between the elastic and inelastic channels and without the $\Lambda_c\bar D^{(*)}$
interactions, (b) scheme II, where the OPE is added to scheme I, and (c) scheme III, where the $\Lambda_c\bar
D^{(*)}$ interactions are included in addition. It is shown that to obtain cutoff independent results,
OPE in the multichannel system is to be supplemented with $S$-wave-to-$D$-wave mixing contact
terms. As a result we demonstrate that the experimental data are consistent with the interpretation
of the $P_c(4312)$ and $P_c(4440)/P_c(4457)$ as $\Sigma_c\bar{D}$ and $\Sigma_c \bar{D}^{*}$
molecules, respectively, and that the data show clear evidence for a new narrow state, $P_c(4380)$,
identified as a $\Sigma_c^*\bar D$ molecule, which should exist as a consequence of HQSS. However,
now two solutions are found in all schemes which describe the data equally well, and thus no unambiguous
conclusion about the quantum numbers of the $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ from data in the $J/\psi
p$ channel alone is possible. It is argued that one of these solutions, in which the quantum numbers
of the $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ are $J^P=3/2^-$ and $1/2^-$, respectively, is theoretically
preferred. Moreover, we demonstrate that the line shapes related to the $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$
in the $\Sigma_c^{(*)}\bar{D}$ and $\eta_cp$ mass distributions will allow one to pin down their
quantum numbers once the data are available.

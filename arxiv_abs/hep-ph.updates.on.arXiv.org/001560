A mirror-extended standard model (MESM) is offered, where in the left-right symmetric underlying
action the sector of the standard model (SM) and its mirror copy have the same SU(2)\times U(1) gauge
structure and parameters; the mirror fermion counter-partners have opposite chiralities. A theory
is used that allows one to obtain MESM in Minkowski space only if we start with an accurate account
of gravity and only at the end go to the limit of Minkowski space. Spontaneous breaking of left-right
symmetry and the "wrong" sign in the mass terms of the Higgs fields potentials arise due to the initial
conditions imposed on the T-model inflation. MESM allows choosing the universal Yukawa coupling
constant $y$ in the underlying Lagrangian for all generations of charged leptons and up-quarks.
As an example, with y=10^{-3}, it is shown that a set of additional dimensionless parameters in width
range less than 0.5 is sufficient to obtain the masses of all known charged leptons and up-quarks.
In this sense, MESM bypasses the problem of the fermion mass hierarchy. With this choice of parameters,
MESM predicts that vacuum expectation value for the mirror Higgs field is 10^{14}GeV and masses
of mirror particles are in the range 10^{8}GeV-10^{14}GeV. There is only gravitational interaction
between particles of the SM and mirror sectors. Hence, mirror particles can constitute dark matter.
The vacuum is realized as a limiting state in the cosmological evolution of the inflaton and classical
Higgs fields, in which the energy stored in them becomes minimal, providing the maximum possible
contribution of these fields to the entropy of the Universe. If further study of the model reveals
the existence of an effective mechanism for preheating the Universe, this will mean that the cosmological
constant problem is absent.

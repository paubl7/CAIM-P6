Using the dipole picture for electron-nucleus deep inelastic scattering at small Bjorken $x$,
we study the effects of gluon saturation in the nuclear target on the cross-section for SIDIS (single
inclusive hadron, or jet, production). We argue that the sensitivity of this process to gluon saturation
can be enhanced by tagging on a hadron (or jet) which carries a large fraction $z \simeq 1$ of the longitudinal
momentum of the virtual photon. This opens the possibility to study gluon saturation in relatively
hard processes, where the virtuality $Q^2$ is (much) larger than the target saturation momentum
$Q_s^2$, but such that $z(1-z)Q^2\lesssim Q_s^2$. Working in the limit $z(1-z)Q^2\ll Q_s^2$,
we predict new phenomena which would signal saturation in the SIDIS cross-section. For sufficiently
low transverse momenta $k_\perp\ll Q_s$ of the produced particle, the dominant contribution comes
from elastic scattering in the black disk limit, which exposes the unintegrated quark distribution
in the virtual photon. For larger momenta $k_\perp\gtrsim Q_s$, inelastic collisions take the
leading role. They explore gluon saturation via multiple scattering, leading to a Gaussian distribution
in $k_\perp$ centred around $Q_s$. When $z(1-z)Q^2\ll Q^2$, this results in a Cronin peak in the
nuclear modification factor (the $R_{pA}$ ratio) at moderate values of $x$. With decreasing $x$,
this peak is washed out by the high-energy evolution and replaced by nuclear suppression ($R_{pA}<1$)
up to large momenta $k_\perp\gg Q_s$. Still for $z(1-z)Q^2\ll Q_s^2$, we also compute SIDIS cross-sections
integrated over $k_\perp$. We find that both elastic and inelastic scattering are controlled by
the black disk limit, so they yield similar contributions, of zeroth order in the QCD coupling.

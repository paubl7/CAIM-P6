Particle-antiparticle pairs can be produced by background electric fields via the Schwinger mechanism
provided they are unconfined. If, as in QED in (3+1)-$d$ these particles are massive, the particle
production rate is exponentially suppressed below a threshold field strength. Above this threshold,
the energy for pair creation must come from the electric field itself which ought to eventually relax
to the threshold strength. Calculating this relaxation in a self-consistent manner, however,
is difficult. Chu and Vachaspati addressed this problem in the context of capacitor discharge in
massless QED$_2$ [1] by utilizing bosonization in two-dimensions. When the bare fermions are massless,
the dual bosonized theory is free and capacitor discharge can be analyzed exactly [1], however,
special care is required in its interpretation given that the theory exhibits confinement. In this
paper we reinterpret the findings of [1], where the capacitors Schwinger-discharge via electrically
neutral dipolar meson-production, and generalize this to the case where the fermions have bare
masses. Crucially, we note that when the initial charge of the capacitor is large compared to the
charge of the fermions, $Q \gg e$, the classical equation of motion for the bosonized model accurately
characterizes the dynamics of discharge. For massless QED$_2$, we find that the discharge is suppressed
below a critical plate separation that is commensurate with the length scale associated with the
meson dipole moment. For massive QED$_2$, we find in addition, a mass threshold familiar from (3+1)-$d$,
and show the electric field relaxes to a final steady state with a magnitude proportional to the initial
charge. We discuss the wider implications of our findings and identify challenges in extending
this treatment to higher dimensions.

The fast radio bursts ( FRBs ) are energetic radio bursts with millisecond duration only observed
at radio frequencies. The generation mechanism is still mysterious. We have proposed a generation
mechanism of both repeating and one-off FRBs. They arise from the axion star collision with neutron
star or magnetized accretion disk of galactic black hole. Once we accept the existence of the axions,
we find that the mechanism well explain previously observed spectral-temporal features. In this
paper we show that it also explains recently observed phenomena such as downward drifting in the
repeating FRBs, etc.. Analysis of the downward drifting based on Doppler effects has been presented
in recent papers, in which a superradiance system of molecular or atom has been proposed as a source
of FRBs. We apply the analysis to our mechanism and find that it well explains the relation between
the downward drifting rate and the duration of the repeating FRBs. The Doppler effects lead to the
fact that the duration of radio burst with higher center frequency is shorter than that of radio burst
with lower center frequency in the repeating FRBs. Our generation mechanism naturally explain
polarization angle swing observed in the repeating FRB180301 and one-off FRBs. We also discuss
the association between the FRB200428 and magnetar SGR J1935+2154. The X ray burst observed just
after the observation of the FRB could be triggered by the axion star collision with the magnetar.
We also explain the consistency of our generation mechanism with observed spectral-temporal differences
in the repeating and one-off FRBs, e.g. longer duration ( smaller flux density ) of repeating FRBs
than duration ( flux density ) of one-off FRBs.

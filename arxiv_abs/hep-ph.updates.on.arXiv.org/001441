The fermionic fields of one generation of the Standard Model, including the Lorentz spinor degrees
of freedom, can be identified with components of a single real 64-dimensional semi-spinor representation
S of the group Spin(11,3). We describe an octonionic model for Spin(11,3) in which the semi-spinor
representation gets identified with S=OxO', where O,O' are the usual and split octonions respectively.
It is then well-known that choosing a unit imaginary octonion u in Im(O) equips O with a complex structure
J. Similarly, choosing a unit imaginary split octonion u' in Im(O') equips O' with a complex structure
J', except that there are now two inequivalent complex structures, one parametrised by a choice
of a timelike and the other of a spacelike unit u'. In either case, the identification S=OxO' implies
that there are two natural commuting complex structures J, J' on S. Our main new observation is that
the subgroup of Spin(11,3) that commutes with both J, J' on S is the direct product Spin(6) x Spin(4)
x Spin(1,3) of the Pati-Salam and Lorentz groups, when u' is chosen to be timelike. The splitting
of S into eigenspaces of J corresponds to splitting into particles and anti-particles. The splitting
of S into eigenspaces of J' corresponds to splitting of Lorentz Dirac spinors into two different
chiralities. We also study the simplest possible symmetry breaking scenario with the "Higgs" field
taking values in the representation that corresponds to 3-forms in R^{11,3}. We show that this Higgs
can be designed to transform as the bi-doublet of the left/right symmetric extension of the SM, and
thus breaks Spin(11,3) down to the product of the SM, Lorentz and U(1)_{B-L} groups, with the last
one remaining unbroken. This 3-form Higgs field also produces the Dirac mass terms for all the particles.

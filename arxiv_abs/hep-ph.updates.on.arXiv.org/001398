Lepton scattering is an established ideal tool for studying inner structure of small particles
such as nucleons as well as nuclei. As a future high energy nuclear physics project, an Electron-ion
collider in China (EicC) has been proposed. It will be constructed based on an upgraded heavy-ion
accelerator, High Intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) which is currently under construction,
together with a new electron ring. The proposed collider will provide highly polarized electrons
(with a polarization of $\sim$80%) and protons (with a polarization of $\sim$70%) with variable
center of mass energies from 15 to 20 GeV and the luminosity of (2-3) $\times$ 10$^{33}$ cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$. Polarized deuterons and Helium-3, as well as unpolarized ion beams from Carbon to Uranium,
will be also available at the EicC. The main foci of the EicC will be precision measurements of the
structure of the nucleon in the sea quark region, including 3D tomography of nucleon; the partonic
structure of nuclei and the parton interaction with the nuclear environment; the exotic states,
especially those with heavy flavor quark contents. In addition, issues fundamental to understanding
the origin of mass could be addressed by measurements of heavy quarkonia near-threshold production
at the EicC. In order to achieve the above-mentioned physics goals, a hermetical detector system
will be constructed with cutting-edge technologies. This document is the result of collective
contributions and valuable inputs from experts across the globe. The EicC physics program complements
the ongoing scientific programs at the Jefferson Laboratory and the future EIC project in the United
States. The success of this project will also advance both nuclear and particle physics as well as
accelerator and detector technology in China.

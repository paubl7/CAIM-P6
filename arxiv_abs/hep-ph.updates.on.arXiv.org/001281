We study the properties of the strongly-coupled quark-gluon plasma with a multistage model of heavy
ion collisions that combines the T$_\mathrm{R}$ENTo initial condition ansatz, free-streaming,
viscous relativistic hydrodynamics, and a relativistic hadronic transport. A model-to-data
comparison with Bayesian inference is performed, revisiting assumptions made in previous studies.
The role of parameter priors is studied in light of their importance towards the interpretation
of results. We emphasize the use of closure tests to perform extensive validation of the analysis
workflow before comparison with observations. Our study combines measurements from the Large
Hadron Collider and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, achieving a good simultaneous description
of a wide range of hadronic observables from both colliders. The selected experimental data provide
reasonable constraints on the shear and the bulk viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma at $T\sim$
150-250 MeV, but their constraining power degrades at higher temperatures $T \gtrsim 250$ MeV.
Furthermore, these viscosity constraints are found to depend significantly on how viscous corrections
are handled in the transition from hydrodynamics to the hadronic transport. Several other model
parameters, including the free-streaming time, show similar model sensitivity while the initial
condition parameters associated with the T$_\mathrm{R}$ENTo ansatz are quite robust against
variations of the particlization prescription. We also report on the sensitivity of individual
observables to the various model parameters. Finally, Bayesian model selection is used to quantitatively
compare the agreement with measurements for different sets of model assumptions, including different
particlization models and different choices for which parameters are allowed to vary between RHIC
and LHC energies.

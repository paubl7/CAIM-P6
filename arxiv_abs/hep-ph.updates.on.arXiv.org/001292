A promising idea to resolve the long standing Hubble tension is to postulate a new subdominant dark-energy-like
component in the pre-recombination Universe which is traditionally termed as the Early Dark Energy
(EDE). However, as shown in Refs. \cite{Hill:2020osr,Ivanov:2020ril} the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS) data impose tight constraints on this proposal. Here, we
revisit these strong bounds considering the Planck CMB temperature anisotropy data at large angular
scales and the SPTPol polarization and lensing measurements. As advocated in Ref. \cite{Chudaykin:2020acu},
this combined data approach predicts the CMB lensing effect consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM expectation
and allows one to efficiently probe both large and small angular scales. Combining Planck and SPTPol
CMB data with the full-shape BOSS likelihood and information from photometric LSS surveys in the
EDE analysis we found for the Hubble constant $H_0=69.79\pm0.99\,{\rm kms^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$ and
for the EDE fraction $f_{\rm EDE}<0.094\,(2\sigma)$. These bounds obtained without including
a local distance ladder measurement of $H_0$ (SH0ES) alleviate the Hubble tension to a $2.5\sigma$
level. Including further the SH0ES data we obtain $H_0=71.81\pm1.19\,{\rm kms^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$
and $f_{\rm EDE}=0.088\pm0.034$ in full accordance with SH0ES. We also found that a higher value
of $H_0$ does not significantly deteriorate the fit to the LSS data. Overall, the EDE scenario is
(though weakly) favoured over $\Lambda$CDM even after accounting for unconstrained directions
in the cosmological parameter space. We conclude that the large-scale Planck temperature and SPTPol
polarization measurements along with LSS data do not rule out the EDE model as a resolution of the
Hubble tension. This paper underlines the importance of the CMB lensing effect for robust constraints
on the EDE scenario.

The one-loop contributions to the trilinear neutral gauge boson couplings $ZZV^\ast$ ($V=\gamma,Z,Z'$),
parametrized in terms of one $CP$-conserving $f_5^{V}$ and one $CP$-violating $f_4^{V}$ form
factors, are calculated in models with $CP$-violating flavor changing neutral current couplings
mediated by the $Z$ gauge boson and an extra neutral gauge boson $Z'$. Analytical results are presented
in terms of both Passarino-Veltman scalar functions and closed form functions. Constraints on
the vector and axial couplings of the $Z$ gauge boson $\left|g_{{VZ}}^{tu}\right|< 0.0096$ and
$\left|g_{{VZ}}^{tc}\right|<0.011$ are obtained from the current experimental data on the $t\rightarrow
Z q$ decays. It is found that in the case of the $ZZ\gamma^\ast$ vertex the only non-vanishing form
factor is $f_5^{\gamma}$, which can be of the order of $10^{-3}$, whereas for the $ZZZ^\ast$ vertex
both form factors $f_5^{Z}$ and $f_4^{Z}$ are non-vanishing and can be of the order of $10^{-6}$
and $10^{-5}$, respectively. Our estimates for $f_5^{\gamma}$ and $f_5^{Z}$ are smaller than
those predicted by the standard model, where $f_4^{Z}$ is absent up to the one loop level. We also
estimate the $ZZ{Z'}^{*}$ form factors arising from both diagonal and non-diagonal $Z'$ couplings
within a few extension models. It is found that in the diagonal case $f_{5}^{Z'}$ is the only non-vanishing
form factor and its real and imaginary parts can be of the order of $10^{-1}-10^{-2}$ and $ 10^{-2}-10^{-3}$,
respectively, with the dominant contributions arising from the light quarks and leptons. In the
non-diagonal case $f_{5}^{Z^\prime}$ can be of the order of $10^{-4}$, whereas $f_4^{Z'}$ can
reach values as large as $10^{-7}-10^{-8}$, with the largest contributions arising from the $Z'tq$
couplings.

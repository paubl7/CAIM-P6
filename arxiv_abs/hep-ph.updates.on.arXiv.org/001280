Hints of physics beyond the Standard Model in $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ transitions have been accumulating
since the first angular analysis of $B^0 \to K^{*0} \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays by the LHCb experiment in
2013. While exclusive $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays are affected by currently incalculable hadronic
contributions which can mimic New Physics effects, ratios of Branching Ratios of $B \to K^{(*)}
\ell^+ \ell^-$ with muons or electrons in the final state are theoretically very clean and probe
lepton universality violating New Physics. Current measurements of such ratios show a deviation
from universality at the level of $\sim 2.5\sigma$ in both $K$ and $K^*$ decays. Interestingly enough,
among the many New Physics contributions that could explain this universality violation, there
are several options which would also reproduce angular analyses without the need for sizable hadronic
contributions. The LHCb experiment has very recently added a new piece to this puzzle by performing
an angular analysis of $B^+ \to K^{*+} \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays. Combining the latter with $B^0 \to K^{*0}
\mu^+ \mu^-$, we perform a phenomenological analysis within the Standard Model, showing that new
data strengthen the need for sizable hadronic contributions and the correlations among them. We
then extend the analysis to New Physics by considering the Standard Model Effective Theory, and
perform an updated combined fit of all currently available data on $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ transitions,
always taking into account possible hadronic contributions. We find that several New Physics scenarios
are able to provide a satisfactory explanation of experimental data, with the case of a nonvanishing
$C^{LQ}_{2223}$ standing out as the simplest scenario with a significance of almost $6\sigma$.

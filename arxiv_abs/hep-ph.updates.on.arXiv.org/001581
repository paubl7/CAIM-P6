Collider experiments often exploit information about the quantum numbers of final state hadrons
to maximize their sensitivity, with applications ranging from the use of tracking information
(electric charge) for precision jet substructure measurements, to flavor tagging for nucleon
structure studies. For such measurements perturbative calculations in terms of quarks and gluons
are insufficient, and non-perturbative track functions describing the energy fraction of a quark
or gluon converted into a subset of hadrons (e.g. charged hadrons), must be incorporated. Unlike
fragmentation functions, track functions describe correlations between hadrons, and therefore
satisfy complicated non-linear evolution equations whose structure has so far eluded calculation
beyond the leading order. In this Letter we develop an understanding of track functions, and their
interplay with energy flow observables, beyond the leading order, allowing them to be used in state-of-the-art
perturbative calculations for the first time. We identify a shift symmetry in the evolution of their
moments that fixes their structure, and we explicitly compute the evolution of the first three moments
at next-to-leading order, allowing for the description of up to three-point energy correlations.
We then calculate the two-point energy correlator on charged particles at $O(\alpha_s^2)$, illustrating
explicitly that infrared singularities in perturbation theory are absorbed by moments of the track
functions, and also highlighting how these moments seamlessly interplay with modern techniques
for perturbative calculations. Our results extend the boundaries of traditional perturbative
QCD, enabling precision perturbative predictions for energy flow observables sensitive to the
quantum numbers of hadronic states.

In this work, we present a comparative study of the three of the seesaw models, viz., type II, inverse
and linear seesaw models, to investigate about light neutrino masses and mixings, flavour structure,
neutrinoless double beta decay ($ 0\nu \beta \beta $) and charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV)
decay ($\mu\rightarrow e\gamma$). We consider the $ A_{4} $ flavour symmetry, while some other
symmetries, like $U(1)_{X}$, $Z_4$ and $Z_5$ are also included to forbid unwanted terms in the Lagrangian.
Taking into account the present experimental data for the known light neutrino parameters from
recent global fit data, we compute the currently unknown neutrino parameters such as the lightest
neutrino mass ($m_1$), CPV phase (Dirac and Majorana), and effective light neutrino mass in the
neutrinoless double beta decay, by considering different VEV alignments of the triplet scalar
flavon fields. We also elucidate on the octant of atmospheric neutrino mixing angle, $\theta_{23}$,
in the light of our predicted results. Finally, we present the region of parameter spaces of $m_1$,
CPV phases, octant of $\theta_{23}$ and effective mass measurable in of neutrino less double beta
decay experiments, that can be tested in future experiments. We observe that the branching ratio
of ($\mu\rightarrow e\gamma$) can help discriminate the three seesaw models. Further, the favoured
Octant of the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ changes with the VEV alignment of the triplet
flavon field - i.e., the internal flavour structure of the neutrinos is reflected in their composition
(mixing). The constant F determining the scale of flavour symmetry breaking, seesaw scale and coupling
constants of the three seesaw models has also been computed, which puts a constraint among them allowed
by the present experimental results.

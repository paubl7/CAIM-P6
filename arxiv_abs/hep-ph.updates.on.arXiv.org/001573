Theories which provide a dynamical explanation for the large top-quark mass often include TeV-scale
vector-like top-quark and bottom-quark partner states which can be potentially discovered at
the LHC. These states are currently probed through model-independent searches for pair-production
via gluon fusion, as well as through model-dependent complementary electroweak single production.
In this paper we study the potential to extend those searches for the partners of the third-generation
Standard Model quarks on the basis of their expected chromomagnetic interactions. We discuss how
current searches for "excited" bottom-quarks produced via $b$-gluon fusion through chromomagnetic
interactions are relevant, and provide significant constraints. We then explore the region of
the parameter space in which the bottom-quark partner is heavier than the top-quark partner, in
which case the top-partner can be primarily produced via the decay of the bottom-partner. Next,
we probe the potential of the production of a single top-quark partner in association with an ordinary
top-quark by gluon-fusion. Kinematically these two new processes are similar, and they yield the
production of a heavy top partner and a lighter Standard Model state, a pattern which allows for the
rejection of the associated dominant Standard Model backgrounds. We examine the sensitivity of
these modes in the case where the top-partner subsequently decays to a Higgs boson and an ordinary
top-quark, and we demonstrate that these new channels have the potential of extending and complementing
the conventional strategies at LHC run III and at the high-luminosity phase of the LHC. In this last
case, we find that partner masses that range up to about 3~TeV can be reached. This substantially
expands the expected mass reach for these new states, including regions of parameter space that
are inaccessible by traditional searches.

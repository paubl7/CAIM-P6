Motivated by the recent XENON1T results, we explore various new physics models that can be discovered
through searches for electron recoils in O(keV)-threshold direct-detection experiments. First,
we consider the absorption of light bosons, either as dark matter relics or being produced directly
in the Sun. In the latter case, we find that keV mass bosons produced in the Sun provide an adequate
fit to the data but are excluded by stellar cooling constraints. We address this tension by introducing
a novel Chameleon-like axion model, which can explain the excess while evading the stellar bounds.
We find that absorption of bosonic dark matter provides a viable explanation for the excess only
if the dark matter is a dark photon or an axion. In the latter case, photophobic axion couplings are
necessary to avoid X-ray constraints. Second, we analyze models of dark matter-electron scattering
to determine which models might explain the excess. Standard scattering of dark matter with electrons
is generically in conflict with data from lower-threshold experiments. Momentum-dependent interactions
with a heavy mediator can fit the data with dark matter mass heavier than a GeV but are generically
in tension with collider constraints. Next, we consider dark matter consisting of two (or more)
states that have a small mass splitting. The exothermic (down)scattering of the heavier state to
the lighter state can fit the data for keV mass splittings. Finally, we consider a subcomponent of
dark matter that is accelerated by scattering off cosmic rays, finding that dark matter interacting
though an O(100 keV)-mass mediator can fit the data. The cross sections required in this scenario
are, however, typically challenged by complementary probes of the light mediator. Throughout
our study, we implement an unbinned Monte Carlo analysis and use an improved energy reconstruction
of the XENON1T events.

Since the low mass of $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ has still been a problem to the conventional quark model,
one can consider other options regarding as multi-quark system. Therefore we investigate the scalar
open-charm state $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ by Thermal QCD Sum Rules (TQCDSR) method using the two-point
correlation function together with contributions of the non-perturbative condensates up to dimension
six. Deriving and numerically analyzing thermal mass and pole residue sum rules, we accomplish
the effects on the properties of $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ resonance in hot medium. Our numerical evaluations
indicate that the variations in mass and pole residue values are stable through the growing temperature
up to $T\cong100~\mathrm{MeV}$, but they begin to fall sharply after this point. At critical temperature,
the values of mass and pole residue change up to $7\%, 29\% $ of their values in vacuum in the molecular
scenario and $ 7\%, 32\% $ in the diquark-antidiquark scenario. Our results does not give any definite
information as to whether $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ resonance has molecular or diquark-antidiquark structure
since they are very close to each other to differentiate them. Besides, we predict the hadronic parameters
of the bottom partner of the $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ resonance in both molecular and diquark-antidiquark
pictures. This bound state is worth investigating in future experiments. Also the detailed search
of hot medium effects on the hadronic parameters of open-charm meson $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ and the bottom
partner could have some implications to define the QCD phase diagram obtained from heavy-ion collision
experiments. Moreover these results can be useful in distinguishing conventional quark model
mesons from exotica.

We propose a new viable outlook to the mixing between a singlet and a doublet leptonic dark sector
fields. This choice relaxes the dark matter (DM) search constraints on the quintessential scalar
singlet DM as well as presents new opportunities for its detection in the lab. The mixing produces
an arbitrary mass difference between the two components of the extra doublet in a gauge-invariant
way, without introducing any new scale of electroweak symmetry breaking in the theory. It also provides
a useful handle to distinguish between the dark sector particles of different isospins, which is
a challenging task otherwise. As the dark leptons coannihilate non-trivially, the mixing effectively
enhances the viable parameter space for the relic density constraint. In low DM mass regime, our
analysis shows that with a non-zero mixing, it is possible to relax the existing indirect search
bounds on the upper limit of the DM-Standard Model coupling. From the analysis of the $3\tau + E^{miss}_T$
and $\ell\,\tau + E^{miss}_T$ channels for LHC at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, we show that one ensures the
presence of the mixing parameter between the dark sector particles of the theory by looking at the
peak and tail positions of the kinematic distributions. Even with a tweak in the values of other free
parameters within the viable parameter region, the distinct peak and tail positions of the kinematic
distributions remains a constant feature of the model. While both the channels present us the opportunity
to detect the mixing signature at the LHC/HL-LHC, the former gives better results in terms of a larger
region of mixing parameter. From the fiducial cross section, the projected statistical significance
for the integrated luminosity, ${\mathscr L} = 3~\text{ab}^{-1}$, are shown for a combined parameter
region obeying all the existing constraints, where there is the best possibility to detect such
a signature.

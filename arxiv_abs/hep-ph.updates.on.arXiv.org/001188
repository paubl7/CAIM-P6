Ultralight bosons can form large clouds around stellar-mass black holes via the superradiance
instability. Through processes such as annihilation, these bosons can source continuous gravitational
wave signals with frequencies within the range of LIGO and Virgo. If boson annihilation occurs,
then the Galactic black hole population will give rise to many gravitational signals; we refer to
this as the ensemble signal. We characterize the ensemble signal as observed by the gravitational-wave
detectors; this is important because the ensemble signal carries the primary signature that a continuous
wave signal has a boson annihilation origin. We explore how a broad set of black hole population parameters
affects the resulting spin-0 boson annihilation signal and consider its detectability by recent
searches for continuous gravitational waves. A population of $10^8$ black holes with masses up
to $30\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a flat dimensionless initial spin distribution between zero and unity
produces up to a thousand signals loud enough to be in principle detected by these searches. For a
more moderately spinning population the number of signals drops by about an order of magnitude,
still yielding up to a hundred detectable signals for some boson masses. A non-detection of annihilation
signals at frequencies between 100 and 1200 Hz disfavors the existence of scalar bosons with rest
energies between $2\times10^{-13}$ and $2.5\times10^{-12}$ eV. Finally we show that, depending
on the black hole population parameters, care must be taken in assuming that the continuous wave
upper limits from searches for isolated signals are still valid for signals that are part of a dense
ensemble: Between 200 and 300 Hz, we urge caution when interpreting a null result for bosons between
4 and $6\times10^{-13}$ eV.

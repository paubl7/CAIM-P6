In the standard cosmology, it is believed that there are two weak and distinct band-limited absorption
features, near 20 MHz ($z\sim70$) and 90 MHz ($z\sim15$) in the global cosmological 21 cm signal
which are signatures of collisional gas dynamics in the cosmic dark ages and Lyman-$\alpha$ photons
from the first stars at cosmic dawn, respectively. A similar prediction of two distinct band-limited,
but stronger, absorption features is expected in models with excess gas cooling, which have been
invoked to explain the anomalous EDGES signal. In this work, we explore a novel mechanism, where
dark matter spin-flip interactions with electrons through a light axial-vector mediator could
directly induce a 21 cm signal which is characteristically different from either of these. We find
generically, that our model predicts a strong, broadband absorption signal extending from frequencies
as low as 1.4 MHz ($z\sim1000$), from early in the cosmic dark ages where no conventional signal is
expected, all the way up to 90 MHz, depending upon the epoch of star formation and X-ray heating. We
find a rich set of spectral features that could be probed in current and future experiments looking
for the global 21 cm signal. In standard cosmology and in excess gas cooling models the gas spin temperature
as inferred from the absorption signal is a tracer of the gas kinetic temperature. However, in our
model we find in certain regions of parameter space that the spin temperature and kinetic temperature
of the gas evolve differently, and the absorption signal only measures the spin temperature evolution.
Large swathes of our model parameter space of interest are safe from existing particle physics constraints,
however future searches for short range spin-dependent forces between electrons on the millimeter
to nanometer scale have the potential to discover the light mediator responsible for our predicted
signal.

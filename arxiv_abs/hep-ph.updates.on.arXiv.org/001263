The interactions between two octet baryons are studied at low energies using lattice QCD (LQCD)
with larger-than-physical quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of s-wavem_{\pi}\sim 450s-wave
MeV and a kaon mass of s-wavem_{K}\sim 596s-wave MeV. The two-baryon systems that are analyzed range
from strangeness s-waveS=0s-wave to s-waveS=-4s-wave and include the spin-singlet and triplet
s-waveNNs-wave, s-wave\Sigma Ns-wave (s-waveI=3/2s-wave), and s-wave\Xi\Xis-wave states,
the spin-singlet s-wave\Sigma\Sigmas-wave (s-waveI=2s-wave) and s-wave\Xi\Sigmas-wave (s-waveI=3/2s-wave)
states, and the spin-triplet s-wave\Xi Ns-wave (s-waveI=0s-wave) state. The s-wavess-wave-wave
scattering phase shifts, low-energy scattering parameters, and binding energies when applicable,
are extracted using L\"uscher's formalism. While the results are consistent with most of the systems
being bound at this pion mass, the interactions in the spin-triplet s-wave\Sigma Ns-wave and s-wave\Xi\Xis-wave
channels are found to be repulsive and do not support bound states. Using results from previous studies
at a larger pion mass, an extrapolation of the binding energies to the physical point is performed
and is compared with experimental values and phenomenological predictions. The low-energy coefficients
in pionless EFT relevant for two-baryon interactions, including those responsible for s-waveSU(3)s-wave
flavor-symmetry breaking, are constrained. The s-waveSU(3)s-wave symmetry is observed to hold
approximately at the chosen values of the quark masses, as well as the s-waveSU(6)s-wave spin-flavor
symmetry, predicted at large s-waveN_cs-wave. A remnant of an accidental s-waveSU(16)s-wave
symmetry found previously at a larger pion mass is further observed. The s-waveSU(6)s-wave-symmetric
EFT constrained by these LQCD calculations is used to make predictions for two-baryon systems for
which the low-energy scattering parameters could not be determined with LQCD directly in this study,
and to constrain the coefficients of all leading s-waveSU(3)s-wave flavor-symmetric interactions,
demonstrating the predictive power of two-baryon EFTs matched to LQCD.

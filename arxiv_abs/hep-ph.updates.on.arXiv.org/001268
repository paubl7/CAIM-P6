We study the cosmology of a dark sector consisting of (ultra) light scalars. Since the scalar mass
is radiatively unstable, a special explanation is required to make it much smaller than the UV scale.
There are two well-known mechanisms for the origin of scalar mass. The scalar can be identified as
a pseudo-Goldstone boson, whose shift symmetry is explicitly broken by non-perturbative corrections,
like the axion. Alternatively, it can be identified as a composite particle like the glueball, whose
mass is limited by the confinement scale of the theory. In both cases, the scalar can be naturally
light, but interaction behavior is quite different. The lighter the axion (glueball) mass is, the
weaker (stronger) the interaction strength is. We consider the dark axion whose shift symmetry
is anomalously broken by the hidden non-abelian gauge symmetry. After the confinement of the gauge
group, the dark axion and the dark glueball get masses and both form multicomponent dark matter.
We carefully consider the effects of energy flow from the dark gluons to the dark axions and derive
the full equations of motion for the background and the perturbed variables. The effect of the dark
axion-dark gluon coupling on the evolution of the entropy and the isocurvature perturbations is
also clarified. Finally, we discuss the gravo-thermal collapse of the glueball subcomponent dark
matter after the halos form, in order to explore the potential to contribute to the formation of seeds
for the supermassive black holes observed at high redshifts. With simplified assumptions, the
glueball subcomponent dark matter with the mass of $\sim 0.01-1{\rm MeV}$, and the axion dark matter
with the GUT scale decay constant (the mass of ${\cal O}(10^{-18})\,{\rm eV}$) can provide the hint
on the origin of the supermassive black holes at high redshifts.

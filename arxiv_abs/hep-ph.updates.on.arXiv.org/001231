The power corrections in the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) of QCD correlators can be viewed mathematically
as an illustration of the transseries concept, which allows to recover a function from its asymptotic
divergent expansion. Alternatively, starting from the divergent behavior of the perturbative
QCD encoded in the singularities in the Borel plane, a modified expansion can be defined by means
of the conformal mapping of this plane. A comparison of the two approaches concerning their ability
to recover nonperturbative properties of the true correlator was not explored up to now. In the present
paper, we make a first attempt to investigate this problem. We use for illustration the Adler function
and observables expressed as integrals of this function along contours in the complex energy plane.
We show that the expansions based on the conformal mapping of the Borel plane go beyond finite-order
perturbation theory, containing an infinite number of terms when reexpanded in powers of the coupling.
Moreover, the expansion functions exhibit nonperturbative features of the true function, while
the expansions have a tamed behavior at large orders and are expected even to be convergent. Using
these properties, we argue that there are no mathematical reasons for supplementing the expansions
based on the conformal mapping of the Borel plane by additional arbitrary power corrections. Therefore,
we make the conjecture that they provide an alternative to the standard OPE in approximating the
QCD correlator. This conjecture allows to slightly improve the accuracy of the strong coupling
extracted from the hadronic $\tau$ decay width. Using the optimal expansions based on conformal
mapping and the contour-improved prescription of renormalization-group resummation, we obtain
$\alpha_s(m_\tau^2)=0.314 \pm 0.006$, which implies $\alpha_s(m_Z^2)=0.1179 \pm 0.0008$.

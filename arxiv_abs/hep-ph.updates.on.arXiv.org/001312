The discrepancy between early-Universe and direct measurements of the Hubble constant, known
as the Hubble tension, recently became a pressing subject in high precision cosmology. As a result,
a large variety of theoretical models have been proposed to relieve this tension. In this work we
analyze a conformally-invariant modified gravity (CIMG) model of an evolving gravitational constant
due to the coupling of a scalar field to the Ricci scalar, which is theoretically advantageous as
it has only one free parameter and its influence is concentrated around matter-radiation equality,
as required for solutions to the Hubble tension based on increasing the sound horizon at recombination.
Inspired by similar recent analyses of so-called early-dark-energy models, we constrain the CIMG
model using a combination of early and late-Universe cosmological datasets. In addition to the
Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and weak lensing measurements, baryon
acoustic oscillations and the Supernova H0 for the Equation of State datasets, we also use large-scale
structure (LSS) datasets such as the Dark Energy Survey year 1 and the full-shape power spectrum
likelihood from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, including its recent analysis using
effective field theory, to check the effect of the CIMG model on the (milder) S8 tension between the
CMB and LSS. We find that the CIMG model can slightly relax the Hubble tension, with H0 = 69.6 +- 1.6
km/s/Mpc at 95% CL, while barely affecting the S8 tension. However, current data does not exhibit
strong preference for CIMG over the standard cosmological model. Lastly, we show that the planned
CMB-S4 experiment will have the sensitivity required to distinguish between the CIMG model and
the more general class of models involving an evolving gravitational constant.

We study the {\it CP}-averaged branching fractions and the {\it CP}-violating asymmetries in the
pure annihilation decays of $B_s^0 \to a_0^+ a_0^-$ and $B_d^0 \to K_0^{*+} K_0^{*-}$, where $a_0\;[K_0^*]$
denotes the scalar $a_0(980)$ and $a_0(1450)$ [$K_0^*(800) ( {\rm or}\; \kappa)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$],
with the perturbative QCD factorization approach under the assumption of two-quark structure
for the $a_0$ and $K_0^*$ states. The numerical results show that the branching ratios of the $B_d^0
\to K_0^{*+} K_0^{*-}$ decays are in the order of $10^{-6}$, while the decay rates of the $B_s^0 \to
a_0^+ a_0^-$ modes are in the order of $10^{-5}$. In light of the measured modes with the same quark
components in the pseudoscalar sector, namely, $B_d^0 \to K^+ K^-$ and $B_s^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-$,
the predictions for the considered decay modes in this work are expected to be measured at the Large
Hadron Collider beauty and/or Belle-II experiments in the (near) future. Meanwhile, it is of great
interest to find that the twist-3 distribution amplitudes $\phi^{S}$ and $\phi^{T}$ with inclusion
of the Gegenbauer polynomials for the scalar $a_0(1450)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$ states in scenario
2 contribute slightly to the branching ratios while significantly to the {\it CP} violations in
the $B_d^0 \to {K_0^*}(1430)^+ {K_0^*}(1430)^-$ and $B_s^0 \to a_0(1450)^+ a_0(1450)^-$ decays,
which indicates that, compared to the asymptotic $\phi^S$ and $\phi^T$, these Gegenbauer polynomials
could change the strong phases evidently in these pure annihilation decay channels. These predictions
await for the future confirmation experimentally, which could further provide useful information
to help explore the inner structure of the scalars and shed light on the annihilation decay mechanism.

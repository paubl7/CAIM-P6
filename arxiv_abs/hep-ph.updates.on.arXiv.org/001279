In the near future, the neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments will hopefully
reach the sensitivity of a few ${\rm meV}$ to the effective neutrino mass $|m^{}_{\beta\beta}|$.
In this paper, we tentatively examine the sensitivity of future $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay experiments
to neutrino masses and Majorana CP phases by following the Bayesian statistical approach. Provided
experimental setups corresponding to the sensitivity of $|m^{}_{\beta\beta}| \simeq 1~{\rm
meV}$, the null observation of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays in the case of normal neutrino mass ordering
leads to a very competitive bound on the lightest neutrino mass $m^{}_1$. Namely, the $95\%$ credible
interval turns out to be $1.6~{\rm meV} \lesssim m^{}_1 \lesssim 7.3~{\rm meV}$ or $0.3~{\rm meV}
\lesssim m^{}_1 \lesssim 5.6~{\rm meV}$ when the uniform prior on $m^{}_1/{\rm eV}$ or on $\log^{}_{10}(m^{}_1/{\rm
eV})$ is adopted. Moreover, one of two Majorana CP phases is strictly constrained, i.e., $140^\circ
\lesssim \rho \lesssim 220^\circ$ for both priors of $m^{}_1$. In contrast, if a relatively worse
sensitivity of $|m^{}_{\beta\beta}| \simeq 10~{\rm meV}$ is assumed, the constraint becomes
accordingly $0.6~{\rm meV} \lesssim m^{}_1 \lesssim 26~{\rm meV}$ or $0 \lesssim m^{}_1 \lesssim
6.1~{\rm meV}$, while two Majorana CP phases will be essentially unconstrained. In the same statistical
framework, the prospects for the determination of neutrino mass ordering and the discrimination
between Majorana and Dirac nature of massive neutrinos in the $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay experiments
are also discussed. Given the experimental sensitivity of $|m^{}_{\beta\beta}| \simeq 10~{\rm
meV}$ (or $1~{\rm meV}$), the strength of evidence to exclude the Majorana nature under the null
observation of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays is found to be inconclusive (or strong), no matter which
of two priors on $m^{}_1$ is taken.

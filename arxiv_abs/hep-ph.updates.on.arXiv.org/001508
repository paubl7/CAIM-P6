Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) are pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneously
broken global $U(1)_{\mathrm{PQ}}$ symmetry. Such particles can have lepton-flavor-violating
(LFV) couplings to the SM charged leptons. LFV ALPs provide the possibility to address some of the
SM long-lasting problems. We investigate the sensitivity of a future muon collider suggested by
the Muon Accelerator Program (MAP) to the production of LFV ALPs in the ALP mass range $m_a\leq1$
MeV. ALPs are assumed to be produced through the LFV decay $\tau\rightarrow\ell a$ ($\ell=e,\mu$)
of one of the tau leptons produced in the muon-anti muon annihilation. Performing a realistic detector
simulation and deploying a multivariate technique, we constrain the LFV couplings $c_{\tau e}$
and $c_{\tau \mu}$ for both the cases of unpolarized and polarized muon beams. Three different chiral
structures are considered for the LFV ALP coupling and the muon collider is assumed to operate at
the center-of-mass energies of 126, 350 and 1500 GeV. We present an unprecedented procedure to search
for LFV ALPs at colliders which takes advantage of tau polarization-induced effects. Polarized
tau leptons which produce such effects can be produced when the initial muon beams are polarized.
Utilizing the properties of polarized tau decays, the main SM background which overwhelms the ALP
production in the case of unpolarized muon beams can be significantly suppressed. We present 95$\%$
CL expected limits on the LFV couplings and show that the present analysis can improve current experimental
limits on the ALP LFV couplings by roughly one order of magnitude. The presented idea of utilizing
properties of polarized decays to improve the sensitivity can also be employed in similar collider
searches.

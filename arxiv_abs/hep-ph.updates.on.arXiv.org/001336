The QED four-photon amplitude has been well-studied by many authors, and on-shell is treated in
many textbooks. However, a calculation with all four photons off-shell is presently still lacking,
despite of the fact that this amplitude appears off-shell as a subprocess in many different contexts,
in vacuum as well as with some photons connecting to external fields. The present paper is the first
in a series of four where we use the worldline formalism to obtain this amplitude explicitly in terms
of hypergeometric functions, and derivatives thereof, for both scalar and spinor QED. The formalism
allows us to unify the scalar and spinor loop calculations, to avoid the usual breaking up of the amplitude
into three inequivalent Feynman diagrams, and to achieve manifest transversality as well as UV
finiteness at the integrand level by an optimized version of the integration-by-parts procedure
originally introduced by Bern and Kosower for gluon amplitudes. The full permutation symmetry
is maintained throughout, and the amplitudes get projected naturally into the basis of five tensors
introduced by Costantini et al. in 1971. Since in many applications of the "four-photon box" some
of the photons can be taken in the low-energy limit, and the formalism makes it easy to integrate out
any such leg, apart from the case of general kinematics (part 4) we also treat the special cases of
one (part 3) or two (part 2) photons taken at low energy. In this first part of the series, we summarize
the application of the worldline formalism to the N-photon amplitudes and its relation to Feynman
diagrams, derive the optimized tensor-decomposed integrands of the four-photon amplitudes in
scalar and spinor QED, and outline the computational strategy to be followed in parts 2 to 4.

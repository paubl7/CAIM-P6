Planck's residuals of the CMB temperature power spectrum present a curious oscillatory shape that
resembles an extra smoothing effect of lensing and is the source of the lensing anomaly. The smoothing
effect of lensing to the CMB temperature power spectrum is, to some extent, degenerate with oscillatory
modulations of the primordial power spectrum, in particular if the frequency is close to that of
the acoustic peaks. We consider the possibility that the lensing anomaly reported by the latest
Planck 2018 results may be hinting at an oscillatory modulation generated by a massive scalar field
during an alternative scenario to inflation or by a sharp feature during inflation. We use the full
TTTEEE+low E CMB likelihood from Planck to derive constraints on these two types of models. We obtain
that in both cases the $A_L$ anomaly is mildly reduced to slightly less than $2\sigma$, to be compared
with the $2.8\sigma$ deviation from $A_L=1$ in $\Lambda$CDM. Although the oscillatory features
are not able to satisfactorily ease the lensing anomaly, we find that the oscillatory modulation
generated during an alternative scenario alone, i.e. with $A_L=1$, presents the lowest value of
$\chi^2$, with $\Delta\chi^2=-13$ compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Furthermore, the Akaike Information
Criterion suggests that such an oscillation constitutes an attractive candidate since it has a
value $\Delta{\rm AIC}=-5$ with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, comparable to the $A_L$ parameter. We
also obtain that the equation of state parameter in the alternative scenario is given at $1\sigma$
by $w=0.13\pm0.17$. Interestingly, the matter bounce and radiation bounce scenarios are compatible
with our results. We discuss how these models of oscillatory features can be tested with future observations.

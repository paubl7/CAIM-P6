We compute the Standard Model semileptonic vector and axial-vector form factors for $B_s\to D_s^*$
decay across the full $q^2$ range using lattice QCD. We use the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ)
action for all valence quarks, enabling us to normalise weak currents nonperturbatively. We use
gluon field configurations including $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ HISQ sea quarks and multiple HISQ heavy
quarks with masses from the $c$ mass up to that of the $b$ on our finest lattices. We determine the physical
form factors, with which we construct the differential and total rates for $\Gamma(B_s^0\to D_s^{*-}\ell^+{\nu}_\ell)$.
We find $\Gamma_{\ell=e}/|\eta_\mathrm{EW}V_{cb}|^2=2.07(21)_\mathrm{latt}(2)_\mathrm{EM}\times
10^{13} ~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $\Gamma_{\ell=\mu}/|\eta_\mathrm{EW}V_{cb}|^2=2.06(21)_\mathrm{latt}(2)_\mathrm{EM}\times
10^{13} ~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\Gamma_{\ell=\tau}/|\eta_\mathrm{EW}V_{cb}|^2=5.03(47)_\mathrm{latt}(5)_\mathrm{EM}\times
10^{12} ~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, where $\eta_\mathrm{EW}$ contains the electroweak correction to
$G_F$, the first uncertainty is from our lattice calculation, and the second allows for long-distance
QED effects. We compute the ratio $R(D_s^{*-})\equiv \Gamma_{\ell=\tau}/\Gamma_{\ell=\mu}=0.2442(79)_\mathrm{latt}(35)_\mathrm{EM}$
and obtain a value for the ratio of decay rates $\Gamma_{\ell=\mu}(B_s\to D_s)/\Gamma_{\ell=\mu}(B_s\to
D_s^*)=0.429(43)_\mathrm{latt}(4)_\mathrm{EM}$, which agrees well with recent LHCb results.
We determine $|V_{cb}|=43.0(2.1)_\mathrm{latt}(1.7)_\mathrm{exp}(0.4)_\mathrm{EM} \times
10^{-3}$ by combining our lattice results across the full q^2 range with experimental results from
LHCb. A comparison of our results to the normalised differential decay rate from LHCb shows good
agreement. We also test the impact of new physics couplings on observables sensitive to lepton flavor
universality violation.

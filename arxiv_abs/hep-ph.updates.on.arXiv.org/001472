Dilepton production from hot, dense and magnetized quark matter is studied using the 3-flavor Polyakov
loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model in which the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of
the quarks is also taken into consideration. This is done by first evaluating the thermo-magnetic
spectral function of the vector current correlator employing the real time formalism of finite
temperature field theory and the Schwinger proper time formalism. The constituent quark mass which
goes as an input in the expression of the dilepton production rate (DPR), has been calculated using
the 3-flavor PNJL model employing Pauli-Villiars (PV) regularization. The obtained constituent
quark mass being strongly dependent on the temperature, density, magnetic field and AMM of the quarks,
captures the effect of `strong' interactions specifically around the (pseudo) chiral and confinement-deconfinement
phase transition regions. The analytic structure of the spectral function in the complex energy
plane has been analyzed in detail and a non-trival Landau cut is found in the physical kinematic domains
resulting from the scattering of the Landau quantized quark/antiquark with the photon which is
purely a finite magnetic field effect. Due to the emergence of the Landau cut along with the usual
unitary cut, the DPR is found to be largely enhanced in the low invariant mass region. Owing to the
magnetic field and AMM dependence of the thresholds of these cuts, we find that the kinematically
forbidden gap between the Unitary and Landau cuts vanishes at sufficiently high temperature, density
and magnetic field leading to the generation of a continuous spectrum of dilepton emission over
the whole invariant mass region. In order to see the effects of strangeness and confinement-deconfinement,
the rates are compared with the 3-flavor NJL and the 2-flavor NJL and PNJL models.

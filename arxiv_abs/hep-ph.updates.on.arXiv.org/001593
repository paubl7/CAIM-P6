A Monte Carlo study of identified particle ratio fluctuations at LHC energies is carried out in the
frame work of \hij model using the fluctuation variable $\nu_{dyn}$. The simulated events for Pb-Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s}_{NN}$ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV and Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s}_{NN}$ = 5.44
TeV are analyzed. From this study, it is observed that the values of $[\pi,K]$, $[p,K]$ and $[\pi,p]$
follow the similar trends of energy dependence as observed in the most central collision data by
NA49, STAR and ALICE experiments. It is also observed that $\nu_{dyn}$ for all the three combinations
of particles for semi-central and central collisions, the model predicted values of $\nu_{dyn}[A,B]$
for Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}_{NN}$ = 2.76 TeV agree fairly well with those observed in ALICE
experiment. For peripheral collisions, however, the model predicted values of $\nu_{dyn}[\pi,K]$
are somewhat smaller, whereas for $[p,K]$ and $[\pi,p]$ it predicts larger values as compared to
the corresponding experimental values. The possible reasons for the observed differences are
discussed. The $\nu_{dyn}$ values scaled with charged particle density when plotted against $\langle$N$_{part}$$\rangle$,
exhibit a flat behaviour, as expected from the independent particle emission sources. For $[p,K]$
and $[\pi,p]$ combinations, a departure from the flat trend is, however, observed in central collisions
in the case of low p$_{T}$ window when effect of jet quenching or resonances are considered. Furthermore,
the study of $\nu_{dyn}[A,B]$ dependence on particle density for various collision systems (including
proton-proton collisions) suggests that at LHC energies $\nu_{dyn}$ values for a given particle
pair is simply a function of charged particle density, irrespective of system size, beam energy
and collision centrality.

Semileptonic flavor changing neutral current transitions with a pair of neutrinos in the final
state are very accurately determined in the standard model (SM) and thus provide an accurate and
sensitive probe for physics beyond the SM. Until recently, the poor tagging efficiency for the $B\to
K^{(*)}\nu \bar{\nu}$ modes made them less advantageous as a probe of new physics (NP) compared
to the charged lepton counterparts. The most recent Belle II result on $B\to K \nu \bar{\nu}$ uses
an innovative inclusive tagging technique resulting in a higher tagging efficiency; this together
with previous BaBar and Belle results indicates a possible enhancement in the branching fraction
of $B^+\to K^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$. A reanalysis of the full Belle dataset together with upcoming Belle
II dataset is expected to result in a much more precise measurement of this mode. If the branching
ratio is indeed found to be enhanced with improved measurements, this would provide an unambiguous
signal of NP without uncertainties due to long-distance non-factorizable effects or power corrections
(in contrast to $B\to K^{(*)} \ell \ell$). We have explored the possibilities of such an enhancement
as a signal of NP within several scenarios, which can also explain some of the other tensions observed
in neutral as well as charged current $B$-decays. In an effective field theory approach, with the
most general dimension-six Hamiltonian including light right-handed neutrinos, we explore the
viability of all scalar and vector leptoquarks as well as the parameter space possible with a generic
vector gauge boson $Z^\prime$ model assuming minimal new particle content. While being consistent
with all data, correlations between the observed intriguing discrepancies in $B$-decays are also
obtained, which will discriminate between the various NP scenarios.

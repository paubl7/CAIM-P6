High to ultrahigh energy neutrino detectors can uniquely probe the properties of dark matter $\chi$
by searching for the secondary products produced through annihilation and/or decay processes.
We evaluate the sensitivities to dark matter thermally averaged annihilation cross section $\langle\sigma
v\rangle$ and partial decay width into neutrinos $\Gamma_{\chi\rightarrow\nu\bar{\nu}}$ (in
the mass scale $10^7 \leq m_\chi/{\rm GeV} \leq 10^{15}$) for next generation observatories like
POEMMA and GRAND. We show that in the range $ 10^7 \leq m_\chi/{\rm GeV} \leq 10^{11}$, space-based
Cherenkov detectors like POEMMA have the advantage of full-sky coverage and rapid slewing, enabling
an optimized dark matter observation strategy focusing on the Galactic center. We also show that
ground-based radio detectors such as GRAND can achieve high sensitivities and high duty cycles
in radio quiet areas. We compare the sensitivities of next generation neutrino experiments with
existing constraints from IceCube and updated 90\% C.L. upper limits on $\langle\sigma v\rangle$
and $\Gamma_{\chi\rightarrow\nu\bar{\nu}}$ using results from the Pierre Auger Collaboration
and ANITA. We show that in the range $ 10^7 \leq m_\chi/{\rm GeV} \leq 10^{11}$ POEMMA and GRAND10k
will improve the neutrino sensitivity to particle dark matter by factors of 2 to 10 over existing
limits, whereas GRAND200k will improve this sensitivity by two orders of magnitude. In the range
$10^{11} \leq m_\chi/{\rm GeV} \leq 10^{15}$, POEMMA's fluorescence observation mode will achieve
an unprecedented sensitivity to dark matter properties. Finally, we highlight the importance
of the uncertainties related to the dark matter distribution in the Galactic halo, using the latest
fit and estimates of the Galactic parameters.

Current measurements of cosmic-ray fluxes have reached unprecedented accuracy thanks to the new
generation of experiments, and in particular the AMS-02 mission. At the same time, significant
progress has been made in the propagation models of galactic cosmic rays. These models include several
propagation parameters, which are usually inferred from the ratios of secondary to primary cosmic
rays, and which depend on the cross sections describing the collisions among the various species
of cosmic-ray nuclei. At present, our knowledge of these cross sections in the energy range where
cosmic-ray interactions occur is limited, and this is a source of uncertainties in the predicted
fluxes of secondary cosmic-ray nuclei. In this work we study the impact of the cross section uncertainties
on the fluxes of light secondary nuclei (Li, Be, B) using a preliminary version of the upcoming {\tt
DRAGON2} code. We first present a detailed comparison of the secondary fluxes computed by implementing
different parametrizations for the network of spallation cross sections. Then, we propose for
the first time the use of secondary-over-secondary cosmic-ray flux ratios as a tool to investigate
the consistency of cross sections models and give insight of the overall uncertainties coming from
the cross sections parametrizations. We show that the uncertainties inferred from the cross section
data are enough to explain the discrepancies in the Be and Li fluxes with respect to the AMS-02 data,
with no need of a primary component in their spectra. In addition, we show that the fluxes of B, Be and
Li can be simultaneously reproduced by rescaling their cross sections within the experimental
uncertainty. Finally, we also revisit the diffusive estimation of the halo size, obtaining good
agreement with previous works and a best fit value of $6.8 \pm 1$ kpc from the most updated cross sections
parametrizations.

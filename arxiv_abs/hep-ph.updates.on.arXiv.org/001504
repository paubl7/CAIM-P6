The generic Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) model has given rise to the BHLS$_2$ variant which introduces
symmetry breaking in the vector meson sector; the central mechanism is a modification of the covariant
derivative at the root of the HLS approach. However, the description of the Belle $\tau$ dipion spectra
is not satisfactory whereas the dealing with its annihilation sector ($e^+ e^- \rightarrow \pi^+
\pi^-/\pi^+ \pi^-\pi^0/ \pi^0 \gamma/\eta \gamma/K^+ K^-/K_L K_S$) is optimum. This issue is
solved by an additional breaking term allowing to include the $[\pi^0,\eta,\eta^\prime]$ system.
This extension of the usual 't~Hooft determinant term only affects the BHLS$_2$ kinetic energy
term. One obtains a fair account for the $\tau$ dipion spectra as well as for the annihilation channels.
The Belle dipion spectrum provides evidence for a violation of CVC in the $\tau$ lepton decay; this
evidence is strengthened by imposing the conditions $<0|J_\mu^q |[q^\prime \overline{q^\prime}](p)>=ip_\mu
f_q \delta_{q q^\prime }, \{ [q \overline{q}], q=u,d,s\}$ on BHLS$_2$ axial current matrix elements.
BHLS$_2$ is found to recover the usual (completed) formulae for the [$\pi^0,~\eta,~\eta^\prime$]
mixing parameters and the global fits return mixing parameter values in agreement with expectations
and better uncertainties. Updating the muon HVP, one argues that the strong tension between the
KLOE and BaBar pion form factors imposes to provide two solutions : $a_\mu^{HVP-LO}({\rm KLOE})=687.31
\pm 2.93$ and $a_\mu^{HVP-LO}({\rm BaBar})=692.36 \pm 2.95$, in units of $10^{-10}$, rather than
some combination of these. Taking into account common systematics, their differences with the
experimental BNL-FNAL average value exhibit significances $> 5.4\sigma$ (KLOE) and $> 4.1\sigma$
(BaBar) with fit probabilities favoring the former.

The Fermilab Muon $g-2$ experiment recently reported its first measurement of the anomalous magnetic
moment $a_\mu^{\textrm{FNAL}}$, which is in full agreement with the previous BNL measurement
and pushes the world average deviation $\Delta a_\mu^{2021}$ from the Standard Model to a significance
of $4.2\sigma$. Here we provide an extensive survey of its impact on beyond the Standard Model physics.
We use state-of-the-art calculations and a sophisticated set of tools to make predictions for $a_\mu$,
dark matter and LHC searches in a wide range of simple models with up to three new fields, that represent
some of the few ways that large $\Delta a_\mu$ can be explained. In addition for the particularly
well motivated Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, we exhaustively cover the scenarios where
large $\Delta a_\mu$ can be explained while simultaneously satisfying all relevant data from other
experiments. Generally, the $\Delta a_\mu$ result can only be explained by rather small masses
and/or large couplings and enhanced chirality flips, which can lead to conflicts with limits from
LHC and dark matter experiments. Our results show that the new measurement excludes a large number
of models and provides crucial constraints on others. Two-Higgs doublet and leptoquark models
provide viable explanations of $a_\mu$ only in specific versions and in specific parameter ranges.
Among all models with up to three fields, only models with chirality enhancements can accommodate
$a_\mu$ and dark matter simultaneously. The MSSM can simultaneously explain $a_\mu$ and dark matter
for Bino-like LSP in several coannihilation regions. Allowing under abundance of the dark matter
relic density, the Higgsino- and particularly Wino-like LSP scenarios become promising explanations
of the $a_\mu$ result.

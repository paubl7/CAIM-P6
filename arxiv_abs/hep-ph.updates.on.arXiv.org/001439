We present high statistics results for the isovector nucleon charges and form factors using seven
ensembles of 2+1-flavor Wilson-clover fermions. The axial and pseudoscalar form factors obtained
on each ensemble satisfy the PCAC relation once the lowest energy $N\pi$ excited state is included
in the spectral decomposition of the correlation functions used for extracting the ground state
matrix elements. Similarly, we find evidence that the $N\pi\pi $ excited state contributes to the
correlation functions with the vector current, consistent with the vector meson dominance model.
The resulting form factors are consistent with the Kelly parameterization of the experimental
electric and magnetic data. Our final estimates for the isovector charges are $g_{A}^{u-d} = 1.31(06)(05)_{sys}$,
$g_{S}^{u-d} = 1.06(10)(06)_{sys}$, and $g_{T}^{u-d} = 0.95(05)(02)_{sys}$, where the first
error is the overall analysis uncertainty and the second is an additional combined systematic uncertainty.
The form factors yield: (i) the axial charge radius squared, ${\langle r_A^2 \rangle}^{u-d}=0.428(53)(30)_{sys}\
{\rm fm}^2$, (ii) the induced pseudoscalar charge, $g_P^\ast=7.9(7)(9)_{sys}$, (iii) the pion-nucleon
coupling $g_{\pi {\rm NN}} = 12.4(1.2)$, (iv) the electric charge radius squared, ${\langle r_E^2
\rangle}^{u-d} = 0.85(12)(19)_{sys} \ {\rm fm}^2$, (v) the magnetic charge radius squared, ${\langle
r_M^2 \rangle}^{u-d} = 0.71(19)(23)_{\rm sys} \ {\rm fm}^2$, and (vi) the magnetic moment $\mu^{u-d}
= 4.15(22)(10)_{\rm sys}$. All our results are consistent with phenomenological/experimental
values but with larger errors. Lastly, we present a Pad\'e parameterization of the axial, electric
and magnetic form factors over the range $0.04< Q^2 <1$ GeV${}^2$ for phenomenological studies.

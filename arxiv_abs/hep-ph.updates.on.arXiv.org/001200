The dynamics of shower development for a jet traveling through the QGP involves a variety of scales,
one of them being the heavy quark mass. Even though the mass of the heavy quarks plays a subdominant
role during the high virtuality portion of the jet evolution, it does affect longitudinal drag and
diffusion, stimulating additional radiation from heavy quarks. These emissions partially compensate
the reduction in radiation from the dead cone effect. In the lower virtuality part of the shower,
when the mass is comparable to the transverse momenta of the partons, scattering and radiation processes
off heavy quarks differ from those off light quarks. All these factors result in a different nuclear
modification factor for heavy versus light flavors and thus for heavy-flavor tagged jets. In this
study, the heavy quark shower evolution and the fluid dynamical medium are modeled on an event by
event basis using the JETSCAPE Framework. We present a multi-stage calculation that explores the
differences between various heavy quark energy-loss mechanisms within a realistically expanding
quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Inside the QGP, the highly virtual and energetic portion of the shower
is modeled using the MATTER generator, while the LBT generator models the showers induced by energetic
and close-to-on-shell heavy quarks. Energy-momentum exchange with the medium, essential for
the study of jet modification, proceeds using a weak coupling recoil approach. The JETSCAPE framework
allows for transitions, on the level of individual partons, from one energy-loss prescription
to the other depending on the parton's energy and virtuality and the local density. This allows us
to explore the effect and interplay between the different regimes of energy loss on the propagation
and radiation from hard heavy quarks in a dense medium.

The demand for computational resources is steadily increasing in experimental high energy physics
as the current collider experiments continue to accumulate huge amounts of data and physicists
indulge in more complex and ambitious analysis strategies. This is especially true in the fields
of hadron spectroscopy and flavour physics where the analyses often depend on complex multidimensional
unbinned maximum-likelihood fits, with several dozens of free parameters, with an aim to study
the internal structure of hadrons. Graphics processing units (GPUs) represent one of the most sophisticated
and versatile parallel computing architectures that are becoming popular toolkits for high energy
physicists to meet their computational demands. GooFit is an upcoming open-source tool interfacing
ROOT/RooFit to the CUDA platform on NVIDIA GPUs that acts as a bridge between the MINUIT minimization
algorithm and a parallel processor, allowing probability density functions to be estimated on
multiple cores simultaneously. In this article, a full-fledged amplitude analysis framework
developed using GooFit is tested for its speed and reliability. The four-dimensional fitter framework,
one of the firsts of its kind to be built on GooFit, is geared towards the search for exotic tetraquark
states in the $B^0 \rightarrow J/\psi K \pi$ decays and can also be seamlessly adapted for other similar
analyses. The GooFit fitter, running on GPUs, shows a remarkable improvement in the computing speed
compared to a ROOT/RooFit implementation of the same analysis running on multi-core CPU clusters.
Furthermore, it shows sensitivity to components with small contributions to the overall fit. It
has the potential to be a powerful tool for sensitive and computationally intensive physics analyses.

This PhD thesis deals with the current experimental hint for large CP violation in the leptonic sector.
We first quantify its global statistical significance, by combining the results from relevant
neutrino oscillation experiments. As the hint is indirect, other new physics apart from three massive
neutrinos could be present, masking the results as direct leptonic CP violation has not yet been
conclusively observed. Thus, we move on to checking the robustness of the hint against the framework
in which the experimental data is interpreted; in other words, its physical origin. To that purpose,
we confront with data the scenario that is less bounded by other experiments: neutral current Non-Standard
Interactions (NSI) among neutrinos and matter. In the end, CP violation induced by neutrino masses
and leptonic mixing is found to be quite robust, due to the large amount of neutrino flavour transition
data collected along three decades. Nevertheless, the next generation LBL accelerator experiments
are aimed at precision measurements that could be more severely affected. Luckily, in the last years
the COHERENT experiment has provided independent constraints on NSI. In the final chapter of the
thesis, the data from the COHERENT experiment is analysed and integrated into the global analyses
from previous chapters. These first results could be greatly improved by increasing the statistics
of the signal and/or by performing measurements with different nuclei sensitive to different NSI
models. For that, the European Spallation Source is an ideal future facility, whose prospects for
bounding NSI are also explored. In summary, this thesis takes a global approach to rigorously assess
whether cutting-edge leptonic flavour measurements are pointing towards a new strong violation
of a symmetry of Nature.

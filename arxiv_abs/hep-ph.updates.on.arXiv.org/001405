The nonlinear memory effect is a fascinating prediction of general relativity (GR), in which oscillatory
gravitational-wave (GW) signals are generically accompanied by a monotonically-increasing
strain which persists in the detector long after the signal has passed. This effect presents a unique
opportunity to test GR in the dynamical and nonlinear regime. In this article we calculate the nonlinear
memory signal associated with GW bursts from cusps and kinks on cosmic string loops, which are an
important target for current and future GW observatories. We obtain analytical waveforms for the
GW memory from cusps and kinks, and use these to calculate the "memory of the memory" and other higher-order
memory effects. These are among the first memory observables computed for a cosmological source
of GWs, with previous literature having focused almost entirely on astrophysical sources. Surprisingly,
we find that the cusp GW signal diverges for sufficiently large loops, and argue that the most plausible
explanation for this divergence is a breakdown in the weak-field treatment of GW emission from the
cusp. This shows that previously-neglected strong gravity effects must play an important role
near cusps, although the exact mechanism by which they cure the divergence is not currently understood.
We show that one possible resolution is for these cusps to collapse to form primordial black holes
(PBHs); the kink memory signal does not diverge, in agreement with the fact that kinks are not predicted
to form PBHs. Finally, we investigate the prospects for detecting memory from cusps and kinks with
GW observatories. We find that in the scenario where the cusp memory divergence is cured by PBH formation,
the memory signal is strongly suppressed and is not likely to be detected. However, alternative
resolutions of the cusp divergence may in principle lead to much more favourable observational
prospects.

In $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ (\to \Lambda^0 \pi^+) \tau^- \bar{\nu}_\tau $ decay, the solid
angle of the final-state particle $\tau^-$ cannot be determined precisely since the decay products
of the $\tau^-$ include an undetected $\nu_\tau$. Therefore, the angular distribution of this
decay cannot be measured. In this work, we construct a {\it measurable} angular distribution by
considering the subsequent decay $\tau^- \to \pi^- \nu_\tau$. The full cascade decay is $\Lambda_b^0
\to \Lambda_c^+ (\to \Lambda^0 \pi^+)\tau^- (\to \pi^- \nu_\tau)\bar{\nu}_\tau$. The three-momenta
of the final-state particles $\Lambda^0$, $\pi^+$, and $\pi^-$ can be measured. Considering all
Lorentz structures of the new physics (NP) effective operators and an unpolarized initial $\Lambda_b$
state, the five-fold differential angular distribution can be expressed in terms of ten angular
observables ${\cal K}_i (q^2, E_\pi)$. By integrating over some of the five kinematic parameters,
we define a number of observables, such as the $\Lambda_c$ spin polarization $P_{\Lambda_c}(q^2)$
and the forward-backward asymmetry of $\pi^-$ meson $A_{FB}(q^2)$, both of which can be represented
by the angular observables $\widehat{{\cal K}}_i (q^2)$. We provide numerical results for the
entire set of the angular observables $\widehat{{\cal K}}_i (q^2)$ and $\widehat{{\cal K}}_i$
both within the Standard Model and in some NP scenarios, which are a variety of best-fit solutions
in seven different NP hypotheses. We find that the NP which can resolve the anomalies in $\bar{B}
\to D^{(*)} \tau^- \bar{\nu}_\tau$ decays has obvious effects on the angular observables $\widehat{{\cal
K}}_i (q^2)$, except $\widehat{{\cal K}}_{1ss} (q^2)$ and $\widehat{{\cal K}}_{1cc} (q^2)$.

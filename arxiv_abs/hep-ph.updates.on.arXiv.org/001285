The azimuthal decorrelation angle between the leading jet and scattered lepton in deep inelastic
scattering is studied with the ZEUS detector at HERA. The data was taken in the HERA II data-taking
period and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 330 $\rm{pb^{-1}}$. Azimuthal angular decorrelation
has been proposed to study the $Q^{2}$ dependence of the evolution of the transverse momentum distributions
(TMDs) and understand the small-$x$ region, providing unique insight to nucleon structure. Previous
decorrelation measurements of two jets have been performed in proton-proton collisions at very
high transverse momentum; these measurements are well described by perturbative QCD at next-to-leading
order. The azimuthal decorrelation angle obtained in these studies shows good agreement with predictions
from Monte Carlo models including leading order matrix elements and parton showers. New experimental
data on charged particle multiplicity distributions are presented, covering the kinematic ranges
in momentum transfer $5<Q^{2}<100~\rm GeV^{2}$ and inelasticity $0.0375<y<0.6$. The data was
recorded with the H1 experiment at the HERA collider in positron-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass
energy of 320 GeV. Charged particles are counted with transverse momenta larger than 150 MeV and
pseudorapidity $-1.6<\eta_{\rm lab}<1.6$ in the laboratory frame, corresponding to high acceptance
in the current hemisphere of the hadronic centre-of-mass frame. Charged particle multiplicities
are reported on a two-dimensional grid of $Q^{2}$, $y$ and on a three-dimensional grid of $Q^{2}$,
$y$ and $\eta$. The observable is the probability $P(N)$ to observe $N$ particles in the given $\eta$
region. The data are confronted with predictions from Monte Carlo generators, and with a simplistic
model based on quantum entanglement and strict parton-hadron duality.

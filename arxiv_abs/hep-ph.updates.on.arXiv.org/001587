Since the discovery in 2012 of the Higgs boson at the LHC, as the last missing piece of the Standard
Model of particle physics, any hint of new physics has been intensively searched for, with no confirmation
to date. There are however slight deviations from the SM that are worth investigating. The CMS collaboration
has reported, in a search for heavy resonances decaying to $t \bar t$ with a 13-TeV center-of-mass
energy and a luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$, deviations from the SM predictions at the 3.5$\sigma$
level locally (1.9$\sigma$ after the look-elsewhere effect). In addition, in the ditau final state
search performed by the ATLAS collaboration at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and $\mathcal{L}=139$ fb$^{-1}$,
deviations from the SM at the 2$\sigma$ level have been also observed. Interestingly, both slight
excesses are compatible with a new pseudoscalar boson with a mass around 400 GeV that couples at least
to fermions of the third generation and gluons. Starting from a purely phenomenological perspective,
we inspect the possibility that a 400-GeV pseudoscalar can account for these deviations and at the
same time satisfy the constraints on the rest of the channels that it gives contributions to and that
are analyzed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. After obtaining the range of effective couplings
compatible with all experimental measurements, we study the gauge invariant UV completions that
can give rise to this type of pseudoscalar resonance, which can be accommodated in an $SO(6)/SO(5)$
model with consistency at the 1$\sigma$ level and in a $SO(5)\times U(1)_{P}\times U(1)_{X}/SO(4)\times
U(1)_X$ at the 2$\sigma$ level, while exceedingly large quartic couplings would be necessary to
account for it in a general two Higgs doublet model.

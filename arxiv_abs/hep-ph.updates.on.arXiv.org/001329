The precision measurement of neutrino parameters can be achieved by studying $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$
oscillations over a large $L/E$ range. In the context of long baseline neutrino experiments (with
fixed $L$), this amounts to examining oscillations over a wide energy range. Most of the current
and future long baseline experiments such as Deep Underground neutrino experiment (DUNE) are mainly
sensitive to the neighbourhood of first oscillation maximum of the $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ probability.
In the present study, we elucidate the role of second oscillation maximum in investigating the sensitivity
to the standard unknowns in oscillation physics. At the second oscillation maximum, one expects
higher sensitivity to $\delta$ as the size of the $\delta$-dependent interference term is a factor
of $\sim 3$ larger than that at the first oscillation maximum. We demonstrate that a beam tune optimized
for coverage of the $2^{nd}$ oscillation maxima at DUNE is possible using proposed accelerator
upgrades that provide multi-MW of power at proton energies of 8 GeV. We perform sensitivity studies
in the context of DUNE by utilising this new multi-MW 8 GeV beam tune inaddition to wide-band beam
tune that fully covers the region of the $1^{st}$ oscillation maxima and part of the $2^{nd}$. We
highlight the importance of second oscillation maximum in deciphering the intrinsic CP phase and
also explore its impact on the precision measurement of the CP phase. We find that addition of the
$2^{nd}$ maxima beam tune to DUNE running with the standard wide-band CP optimized beam tune provides
some improvement in sensitivity to the 3 flavor oscillation parameters. Further studies with improved
detector resolution and beam optimizations will need to be carried out to fully exploit the capabilities
of the $2^{nd}$ maxima beam options at DUNE.

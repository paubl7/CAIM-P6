We have studied the dominant radiative transitions of the charmonium $S$- and $P$-wave states within
the CCQM. The gauge invariant leading-order transition amplitudes have been expressed by using
either the conventional Lorentz structures, or the helicity amplitudes, where it was effective.
The renormalization couplings of the charmonium states have been strictly fixed by the compositeness
conditions that excludes the constituent degrees of freedom from the space of physical states.
We use the basic model parameters for the constituent c-quark mass $m_c=1.80$ GeV and the global
infrared cutoff $\lambda=0.181$ GeV. We additionally introduce only one adjustable parameter
$\varrho>0$ common for the the charmonium states $\eta_c({}^1\!S_0)$, $J/\psi({}^3\!S_1)$,
$\chi_{c0}({^{3}}\!P_{0})$, $\chi_{c1}({^{3}}\!P_{1})$, $h_c({^{1}}\!P_{1})$, and $\chi_{c2}({^{3}}\!P_{2})$
to describe the quark distribution inside the hadron. This parameter describes the ratio between
the charmonium 'size' and its physical mass. The optimal value $\varrho=0.485$ has been fixed by
fitting the latest data for the partial widths of the one-photon radiative decays of the triplet
$\chi_{cJ}({^{3}}\!P_{J}),~J=\{0,1,2\}$. Then, we calculate corresponding fractional widths
for states $J/\psi({}^3\!S_1)$ and $h_c({^{1}}\!P_{1})$. Estimated results are in good agreement
with the latest data. By using the fraction data from PDG2020 and our estimated partial decay width
for $h_c({^{1}}\!P_{1})$ we recalculate the 'theoretical full width' $\Gamma^{\rm theor}_{h_c}
\simeq ( 0.57 \pm 0.12 )$ MeV in comparison with latest data $\Gamma^{\rm exp}_{h_c} \simeq (0.7\pm
0.4)$ MeV. We also repeated our calculations by gradually decreasing the global cutoff parameter
and revealed that the results do not change for any $\lambda<0.181$ GeV up to the 'deconfinement'
limit.

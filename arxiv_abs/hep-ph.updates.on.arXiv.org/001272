The spectroscopic parameters and decay channels of the axial-vector tetraquark $T_{bb;\overline{u}\overline{s}}^{-}$
(in what follows, $T_{b: \overline{s}}^{\mathrm{AV}}$) are explored using the quantum chromodynamics
(QCD) sum rule method. The mass and coupling of this state are calculated using two-point sum rules
by taking into account various vacuum condensates, up to 10 dimensions. Our prediction for the mass
of this state $m=(10215\pm 250)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ confirms that it is stable with respect to strong
and electromagnetic decays and can dissociate to conventional mesons only via weak transformations.
We investigate the dominant semileptonic $T_{b:\overline{s} }^{\mathrm{AV}} \to \mathcal{Z}_{b:\overline{s}}^{0}l\overline{\nu}_l$
and nonleptonic $T_{b:\overline{s}}^{\mathrm{AV}} \to \mathcal{Z}_{b:\overline{s} }^{0}M$
decays of $T_{b:\overline{s}}^{\mathrm{AV}}$. In these processes, $ \mathcal{Z}_{b:\overline{s}}^{0}$
is a scalar tetraquark $[bc][\overline{u} \overline{s}]$ built of a color-triplet diquark and
an antidiquark, whereas $M$ is one of the vector mesons $\rho ^{-}$, $K^{\ast}(892)$, $D^{\ast
}(2010)^{-}$, and $D_{s}^{\ast -}$. To calculate the partial widths of these decays, we use the
QCD three-point sum rule approach and evaluate the weak transition form factors $G_{i}$ $(i=0,1,2,3)$,
which govern these processes. The full width $\Gamma _{\mathrm{full}} =(12.9\pm 2.1)\times 10^{-8}~\mathrm{MeV}$
and the mean lifetime $ \tau=5.1_{-0.71}^{+0.99}~\mathrm{fs}$ of the tetraquark $T_{b:\overline{s}}^{
\mathrm{AV}}$ are computed using the aforementioned weak decays. The obtained information about
the parameters of $T_{b:\overline{s}}^{\mathrm{AV}}$ and $ \mathcal{Z}_{b:\overline{s}}^{0}$
is useful for experimental investigations of these double-heavy exotic mesons.

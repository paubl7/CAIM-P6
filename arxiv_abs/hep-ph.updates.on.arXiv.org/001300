We show possible transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) for spin-1
hadrons including twist-3 and 4 functions in addition to the leading twist-2 ones by investigating
all the possible decomposition of a quark correlation function in the Lorentz-invariant way. The
Hermiticity and parity invariance are imposed in the decomposition; however, the time-reversal
invariance is not used due to an active role of gauge links in the TMDs. Therefore, there exist time-reversal
odd functions in addition to the time-reversal even ones in the TMDs. We list all the functions up
to twist-4 level because there were missing terms associated with the lightcone vector $n$ in previous
works on the twist-2 part and there was no correlation-function study in the twist-3 and 4 parts for
spin-1 hadrons. We show that 40 TMDs exist in the tensor-polarized spin-1 hadron in the twist 2, 3,
and 4. Some expressions of twist-2 structure functions are modified from previous derivations
due to the new terms with $n$, and we find 30 new structure functions in the twist 3 and 4 in this work.
Since time-reversal-odd terms of the collinear correlation function should vanish after integrals
over the partonic transverse momentum, we obtain new sum rules for the time-reversal-odd structure
functions. We also obtain new sum rules the TMDs, $\int d^2 k_T h_{1LT} = \int d^2 k_T h_{LT} = \int
d^2 k_T h_{LL} = \int d^2 k_T h_{3LL} =0$, because of the time-reversal invariance in collinear correlation
functions. In addition, we indicate that new transverse-momentum-dependent fragmentation functions
exist in tensor-polarized spin-1 hadrons. The TMDs are rare observables to find explicit color
degrees of freedom in terms of color flow, which cannot be usually measured because the color is confined
in hadrons.

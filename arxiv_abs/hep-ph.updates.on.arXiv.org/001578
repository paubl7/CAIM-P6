In the present work, it is intended to calculate and study the single and double differential cross-sections
of the prompt single-photon production as a function of produced single-photon transverse momentum
and rapidity, in the high-energy P-P(\={P}) colliders, such as LHC and TEVATRON. The differential
cross-sections of prompt single-photon production are calculated in the $k_t$-factorization
frameworks using various angular ordering unintegrated parton distribution functions (UPDF),
namely the Kimber et al. and Martin et al. procedures. These scheme-dependent UPDF are generated
in the leading and next-to-leading order levels to predict and analyze the different partonic contributions
to the above cross-sections. The above two procedures utilize the phenomenological parton distribution
functions (PDF) libraries of Martin et al., i.e., MMHT2014. It is shown that the calculated prompt
single-photon production differential cross-sections in the above frameworks are relatively
successful in generating satisfactory results compared to the experimental data of different
collaborations, i.e., CDF (2017), ATLAS (2017), CMS (2011) and D0 (2006), as well as the other theoretical
predictions such as collinear factorization Monte Carlo calculations (the JETPHOX, SHERPA, PYTHIA,
and MCFM methods). Also, for a closer precision, the differential cross-section for the NLO gluon-gluon
, quark-gluon and quark-(anti)quark processes are calculated. An extensive discussion and comparison
are made regarding (i) the behavior of the contributing partonic sub-processes, (ii) the possible
double-counting between the $2\to 2$ and $2\to 3$ sub-processes, i.e., gluons-fusion, in our calculated
prompt single-photon production differential cross-sections and (iii) the sensibility check
of our results to the different angular ordering constraints.

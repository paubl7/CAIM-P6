We investigate all potentially viable scenarios that can produce the chiral enhancement required
to simultaneously explain the $(g-2)_{e}$ and $(g-2)_{\mu}$ data with either a single scalar leptoquark
or a pair of scalar leptoquarks. We provide classification of these scenarios in terms of their ability
to satisfy the existing limits on the branching ratio for the $\mu \to e \gamma$ process. The simultaneous
explanation of the $(g-2)_{e,\mu}$ discrepancies, coupled with the current experimental data,
implies that the $(g-2)_e$ loops are exclusively due to the charm quark propagation whereas the
$(g-2)_\mu$ loops are due to the top quark propagation. The scenarios where the $(g-2)_e$ loops
are due to the top (bottom) quark propagation are, at best, approximately nine (three) orders of
magnitude away from the experimental limit on the $\mu \to e \gamma$ branching ratio. All in all,
there are only three particular scenarios that can pass the $\mu \to e \gamma$ test and simultaneously
create large enough impact on the $(g-2)_{e,\mu}$ discrepancies when the new physics is based on
the Standard Model fermion content. These are the $S_1$, $R_2$, and $S_1 \& S_3$ scenarios, where
the first two are already known to be phenomenologically viable candidates with respect to all other
flavor and collider data constraints. We show that the third scenario, where the right-chiral couplings
to charged leptons are due to $S_1$, the left-chiral couplings to charged leptons are due to $S_3$,
and the two leptoquarks mix through the Standard Model Higgs field, cannot address the $(g-2)_{e}$
and $(g-2)_{\mu}$ discrepancies at the $1\sigma$ level due to an interplay between $K_L^0 \to e^\pm
\mu^\mp$, $Z \to e^+ e^-$, and $Z \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ data despite the ability of that scenario to avoid
the $\mu \to e \gamma$ limit.

We have proposed a method for the detection of dark matter axion. It uses superconductor under strong
magnetic field. As is well known, the dark matter axion induces oscillating electric field under
magnetic field. The electric field is proportional to the magnetic field and makes charged particles
oscillate in conductors. Then, radiations of electromagnetic fields are produced. Radiation
flux depends on how large the electric field is induced and how large the number of charged particles
is present in the conductors. We show that the electric field in superconductor is essentially identical
to the one induced in vacuum. It is proportional to the magnetic field. It is only present in the surface
because of Meissner effect. On the other hand, although the magnetic field can penetrates the normal
conductor, the oscillating electric field is only present in the surface of the conductor because
of the skin effect. The strength of the electric field induced in the surface is equal to the one in
vacuum. We obtain the electric field in the superconductor by solving equations of electromagnetic
fields coupled with axion and Cooper pair described by Ginzburg-Landau model. The electric field
in the normal conductor is obtained by solving equations of electromagnetic fields in the conductor
coupled with axion. We compare radiation flux from the cylindrical superconductor with that from
the normal conductor with same size. We find that the radiation flux from the superconductor is a
hundred times larger than the flux from the normal conductor. We also show that when we use superconducting
resonant cavity, we obtain radiation energy generated in the cavity two times of the order of the
magnitude larger than that in normal conducting resonant cavity.

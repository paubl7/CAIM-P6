The in-medium masses of the bottomonium ground states [$1S$ ($\Upsilon (1S), \eta_b$) and $1P$
($\chi_{b0},\chi_{b1}$)] are investigated in the magnetized vacuum (nuclear medium), using
the QCD sum rule framework. In QCD sum rule approach, the mass modifications are calculated in terms
of the medium modifications of the scalar and twist-2 gluon condensates, which are obtained in the
nuclear medium, from the medium change of a scalar dilaton field, $\chi$ within a chiral effective
model. The in-medium masses of the bottomonium ground states are observed to decrease with increasing
density. P-wave states are observed to have more appreciable mass-shifts than the S-wave states.
In the present investigation, the effects of spin-mixing between 1S bottomonium states, $\Upsilon(1S)$
and $\eta_b$ are taking into account in presence of an external magnetic field. The contribution
of magnetic fields are seen to be dominant via spin-magnetic field interaction effects, which leads
to an appreciable rise and drop in the in-medium masses of the longitudinal component of vector $1S$
state ($\Upsilon$) and pseudoscalar state ($\eta_b$) respectively. For zero magnetic field,
the effects of baryon density on the bottomonium ground states in isospin asymmetric nuclear medium
are observed to be quite appreciable. These should have observable consequences for the production
of the open and hidden bottom meson states resulting from high energy asymmetric nuclear collisions
in facilities which probe high density baryonic matter. There is observed to be large contributions
to the masses of the longitudinal component of the vector bottomonium state, $\Upsilon (1S)$ and
pesudoscalar state $\eta_b$ in strong magnetic fields.

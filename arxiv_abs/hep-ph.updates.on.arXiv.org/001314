Lattice gauge theories are a fascinating and rich class of theories relating to the most fundamental
models of particle physics, and as experimental control on the quantum level increases there is
a growing interest in non-equilibrium effects such as dynamical quantum phase transitions. To
demonstrate how these physical theories can be accessed in near-term quantum devices, we study
the dynamics of a (1+1)D U(1) quantum link model following quenches of its mass-term. We find that
the system undergoes dynamical quantum phase transitions for all system sizes considered, even
the smallest where the dynamics can be solved analytically. We devise a gauge invariant string order
parameter whose zeros correlates with the structure of the Loschmidt amplitude, making the order
parameter useful for experimental study in near-term devices. The zeros of the Loschmidt amplitude
as well as the zeros of our order parameter are revealed by vortices in their phases, which can be counted
by a topologically invariant winding number. With noisy intermediate scale quantum devices in
mind, we propose a class of superconducting circuits for the general implementation of U(1) quantum
link models. The principles of these circuits can be generalized to implement other, more complicated
gauge symmetries. Furthermore, the circuit can be modularly scaled to any lattice configuration.
Simulating the circuit dynamics with realistic circuit parameters we find that it implements the
target dynamics with a steady average fidelity of $ 99.5\% $ or higher. Finally, we consider readout
of the circuit using a method that yields information about all the degrees of freedom with resonators
coupled dispersively to only a subset of them. This constitutes a direct and relatively straightforward
protocol to access both Loschmidt amplitudes and the order parameter.

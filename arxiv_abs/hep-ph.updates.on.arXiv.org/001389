In this paper we systematically consider the baryon ($B$) and lepton ($L$) number violating dinucleon
to dilepton decays ($pp\to \ell^+\ell^{\prime+}, pn\to \ell^+\bar\nu^\prime, nn\to \bar\nu\bar\nu^\prime$)
with $\Delta B=\Delta L=-2$ in the framework of effective field theory. We start by constructing
a basis of dimension-12 (dim-12) operators mediating such processes in the low energy effective
field theory (LEFT) below the electroweak scale. Then we consider their standard model effective
field theory (SMEFT) completions upwards and their chiral realizations in baryon chiral perturbation
theory (B$\chi$PT) downwards. We work to the first nontrivial orders in each effective field theory,
collect along the way the matching conditions, and express the decay rates in terms of the Wilson
coefficients associated with the dim-12 operators in SMEFT and the low energy constants pertinent
to B$\chi$PT. We find the current experimental limits push the associated new physics scale larger
than $1-3$ TeV, which is still accessible to the future collider searches. Through weak isospin
symmetry, we find the current experimental limits on the partial lifetimes of transitions $pp\to
\ell^+\ell^{\prime+}, pn\to \ell^+\bar\nu^\prime$ imply stronger limits on $nn\to\bar\nu\bar\nu^\prime$
than their existing lower bounds, which are improved by $2-3$ orders of magnitude. Furthermore,
assuming charged mode transitions are also dominantly generated by the similar dim-12 SMEFT interactions,
the experimental limits on $pp\to e^+e^+,e^+\mu^+,\mu^+\mu^+$ lead to stronger limits on $pn\to
\ell^+_\alpha\bar\nu_\beta$ with $\alpha,\beta=e,\mu$ than their existing bounds. Conversely,
the same assumptions help us to set a lower bound on the lifetime of the experimentally unsearched
mode $pp\to e^+\tau^+$ from that of $pn\to e^+\bar\nu_\tau$, i.e., $\Gamma^{-1}_{pp\to e^+\tau^+}\gtrsim
2\times 10^{34}~\rm yrs$.

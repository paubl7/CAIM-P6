The process of resonant spontaneous bremsstrahlung radiation during the scattering of ultrarelativistic
electrons with energies of the order $\sim 100\ \text{GeV}$ by the nuclei in strong laser fields
with intensities up to $I\sim {{10}^{24}}\ \text{Wc}{{\text{m}}^{\text{-2}}}$ is theoretically
studied. Under resonant conditions, an intermediate electron in the wave field enters the mass
shell. As a result, the initial second-order process by the fine structure constant is effectively
reduced to two first-order processes: laser-stimulated Compton effect and laser-assisted Mott
process. The resonant kinematics for two reaction channels (A and B) is studied in detail. It is shown
that in the resonant case there is a characteristic parameter that determines a significant number
of absorbed laser photons in the laser-stimulated Compton effect. This parameter is determined
by the parameters of the laser installation, the energy of the initial electrons and is proportional
to the intensity of the laser wave. An analytical resonant differential cross-section with simultaneous
registration of the frequency and the outgoing angle of a spontaneous gamma-quantum is obtained.
It is shown that the resonant differential cross-section has the largest value in the region of average
laser fields ($I\sim {{10}^{18}}\ \text{Wc}{{\text{m}}^{\text{-2}}}$) and can be of the order
of $\sim {{10}^{18}}$ in units ${{Z}^{2}}\alpha r_{e}^{2}$. With an increase in the intensity
of the laser wave, the value of the resonant differential cross-section decreases and for the intensity
$I\sim {{10}^{24}}\ \text{Wc}{{\text{m}}^{\text{-2}}}$ is of the order of $\sim {{10}^{4}}$
in units ${{Z}^{2}}\alpha r_{e}^{2}$. The obtained results reveal new features of spontaneous
emission of ultrarelativistic electrons on nuclei in strong laser fields and can be tested at international
laser installations.

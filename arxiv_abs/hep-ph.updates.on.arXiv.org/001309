The aim of the study is to investigate the observability of Pseudo scalar Higgs $ A $ and neutral heavy
CP even Higgs boson $ H $ in the framework of 2HDM type-I using lepton collider which is supposed to
be operating at $\sqrt{s}$ (center-of-mass energy) = 1000 GeV. The process under investigation
is $e^{-}e^{+} \rightarrow AH \rightarrow ZHH \rightarrow jjb \bar{b}b\bar{b}$ and $e^{-}e^{+}
\rightarrow AH \rightarrow b \bar{b}b\bar{b}$. Neutral Higgs pair production at electron positron
collider and its decay is fully hadronic. The pseudoscalar Higgs $ A $ decays to $ Z $ boson along with
neutral heavy CP even Higgs boson $ H $ . The CP even Higgs boson $ H $ decays to pair of bottom quarks.
Heavy Higgs is very unstable particle which decays in no time to bottom pair quark. The different
benchmark points are assumed where various Higgs mass hypotheses are considered. It has been demonstrated
that the heavy Neutral Higgs and Pseudoscalar Higgs signal observability is possible within the
parameter space $ (\tan \beta,m_{A}) $ with respect to all experimental and theoretical constraints.
The CP odd and CP even Higgs bosons in all scenarios are observable when signal exceeds $ 5\sigma $
, which is the final extracted value of signal significance in accordance with range of whole mass.
To be more specific, the region of parameter space with $200\leq m_{A}\leq 250 $ GeV and $m_{H}=150$
GeV at (CMS) $\sqrt{s} = 500$ GeV is accessible at the defined integrated luminosity of about $ 100
fb^{-1} $. Furthermore, region with $ 200\leq m_{A}\leq 330 $ GeV and $ 150\leq m_{H}\leq 250 $ GeV
with mass splitting of about 50-100 GeV between A and H Higgs bosons at $\sqrt{s} = 1000$ GeV is accessible
at same integrated luminosity.

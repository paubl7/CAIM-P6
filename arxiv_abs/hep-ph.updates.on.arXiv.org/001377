Many minimal models of dark matter (DM) or canonical solutions to the hierarchy problem are either
excluded or severely constrained by LHC and direct detection null results. In particular, Higgs
Portal Dark Matter (HPDM) features a scalar coupling to the Higgs via a quartic interaction, and
obtaining the measured relic density via thermal freeze-out gives definite direct detection predictions
which are now almost entirely excluded. The Twin Higgs solves the little hierarchy problem without
coloured top partners by introducing a twin sector related to the Standard Model (SM) by a discrete
symmetry. We generalize HPDM to arbitrary Twin Higgs models and introduce Twin Higgs Portal Dark
Matter (THPDM), which features a DM candidate with an $SU(4)$-invariant quartic coupling to the
Twin Higgs scalar sector. Given the size of quadratic corrections to the DM mass, its most motivated
scale is near the mass of the radial mode. In that case, DM annihilation proceeds with the full Twin
Higgs portal coupling, while direct detection is suppressed by the pNGB nature of the 125 GeV Higgs.
For a standard cosmological history, this results in a predicted direct detection signal for THPDM
that is orders of magnitude below that of HPDM with very little dependence on the precise details
of the twin sector, evading current bounds but predicting possible signals at next generation experiments.
In many Twin Higgs models, twin radiation contributions to $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ are suppressed
by an asymmetric reheating mechanism. We study this by extending the $\nu$MTH and $X$MTH models
to include THPDM and compute the viable parameter space according to the latest CMB bounds. The injected
entropy dilutes the DM abundance as well, resulting in additional suppression of direct detection
below the neutrino floor.

In the late 1990's, observations of 93 Type Ia supernovae were analysed in the framework of the FLRW
cosmology assuming these to be `standard(isable) candles'. It was thus inferred that the Hubble
expansion rate is accelerating as if driven by a positive Cosmological Constant $\Lambda$. This
is still the only direct evidence for the `dark energy' that is the dominant component of the standard
$\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. Other data such as BAO, CMB anisotropies, stellar ages, the rate
of structure growth, etc are all `concordant' with this model but do not provide independent evidence
for accelerated expansion. Analysis of a larger sample of 740 SNe Ia shows that these are not quite
standard candles, and highlights the "corrections" applied to analyse the data in the FLRW framework.
The latter holds in the reference frame in which the CMB is isotropic, whereas observations are made
in our heliocentric frame in which the CMB has a large dipole anisotropy. This is assumed to be of kinematic
origin i.e. due to our non-Hubble motion driven by local inhomogeneity in the matter distribution.
The $\Lambda$CDM model predicts how this peculiar velocity should fall off as the averaging scale
is raised and the universe becomes sensibly homogeneous. However observations of the local `bulk
flow' are inconsistent with this expectation and convergence to the CMB frame is not seen. Moreover
the kinematic interpretation implies a corresponding dipole in the sky distribution of high redshift
quasars, which is rejected by observations at 4.9$\sigma$. The acceleration of the Hubble expansion
rate is also anisotropic at 3.9$\sigma$ and aligned with the bulk flow. Thus dark energy may be an
artefact of analysing data assuming that we are idealised observers in an FLRW universe, when in
fact the real universe is inhomogeneous and anisotropic out to distances large enough to impact
on cosmological analyses.

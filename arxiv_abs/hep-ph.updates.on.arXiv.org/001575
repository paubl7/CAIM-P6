The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) recently announced confirmation of the Brookhaven
National Lab (BNL) measurements of the $g-2$ of the muon that uncovered a discrepancy with the theoretically
calculated Standard Model value. We suggest an explanation for the combined BNL+FNAL 4.2$\sigma$
deviation within the supersymmetric grand unification theory (GUT) model No-Scale $\cal{F}$-$SU(5)$
supplemented with a string derived TeV-scale extra $10+\overline{10}$ vector-like multiplet
and charged vector-like singlet $(XE,XE^c)$, dubbed flippons. We introduced these vector-like
particles into No-Scale Flipped $SU(5)$ many years ago, and as a result, the renormalization group
equation (RGE) running was immediately shaped to produce a distinctive and rather beneficial two-stage
gauge coupling unification process to avoid the Landau pole and lift unification to the string scale,
in addition to contributing through 1-loop to the light Higgs boson mass. The flippons have long
stood ready to tackle another challenge, and now do so yet again, where the charged vector-like "lepton"/singlet
couples with the muon, the supersymmetric down-type Higgs $H_d$, and a singlet $S$, using a chirality
flip to easily accommodate the muonic $g-2$ discrepancy in No-Scale $\cal{F}$-$SU(5)$. Considering
the phenomenological success of this string derived model over the prior 11 years that remains accommodative
of all presently available LHC limits plus all other experimental constraints, including no fine-tuning,
and the fact that for the first time a Starobinsky-like inflationary model consistent with all cosmological
data was derived from superstring theory in No-Scale Flipped $SU(5)$, we believe it is imperative
to reconcile the BNL+FNAL developments within the model space.

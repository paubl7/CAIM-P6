We obtain a Lorentz covariant wave equation whose complex wave function transforms under a Lorentz
boost according to the following rule, $\Psi(x)\rightarrow e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}f(x)}\Psi(x)$.
We show that the spacetime dependent phase $f(x)$ is the most natural relativistic extension of
the phase associated with the transformation rule for the non-relativistic Schr\"odinger wave
function when it is subjected to a Galilean transformation. We then generalize the previous analysis
by postulating that $\Psi(x)$ transforms according to the above rule under proper Lorentz transformations
(boosts or spatial rotations). We use the previous wave equations to describe several physical
systems. In particular, we solve the bound state and scattering problems of two particles which
interact both electromagnetically and gravitationally (static electromagnetic and gravitational
fields). We also formulate logically consistent classical and quantum field theories associated
with these Lorentz covariant wave equations. We show that it is possible to make those theories equivalent
to the Klein-Gordon theory whenever we have self-interacting terms that do not break their Lorentz
invariance or if we introduce electromagnetic interactions via the minimal coupling prescription.
For interactions that break Lorentz invariance, however, we show that the present theories are
not equivalent to Klein-Gordon's and that particles and antiparticles behave differently, with
the latter being more unstable. This suggests a possible connection between Lorentz invariance-breaking
interactions and the matter-antimatter asymmetry problem. We also show that the complex scalar
field theories here presented suggest that particles and antiparticles should have masses with
different signs. We then show that this difference in the sign of the mass between particles and antiparticles
shows up for Lorentz-breaking interactions.

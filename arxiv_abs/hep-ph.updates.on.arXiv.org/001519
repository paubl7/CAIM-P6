We determine the masses, the singlet and octet decay constants as well as the anomalous matrix elements
of the $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ mesons in $N_f=2+1$ QCD\@. The results are obtained using twenty-one
CLS ensembles of non-perturbatively improved Wilson fermions that span four lattice spacings
ranging from $a\approx 0.086\,$fm down to $a\approx 0.050\,$fm. The pion masses vary from $M_{\pi}=420\,$MeV
to $126\,$MeV and the spatial lattice extents $L_s$ are such that $L_sM_\pi\gtrsim 4$, avoiding
significant finite volume effects. The quark mass dependence of the data is tightly constrained
by employing two trajectories in the quark mass plane, enabling a thorough investigation of U($3$)
large-$N_c$ chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). The continuum limit extrapolated data turn out
to be reasonably well described by the next-to-leading order ChPT parametrization and the respective
low energy constants are determined. The data are shown to be consistent with the singlet axial Ward
identity and, for the first time, also the matrix elements with the topological charge density are
computed. We also derive the corresponding next-to-leading order large-$N_{c}$ ChPT formulae.
We find $F^8 = 115.0(2.8)~\text{MeV}$, $\theta_{8} = -25.8(2.3)^{\circ}$, $\theta_0 = -8.1(1.8)^{\circ}$
and, in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme for $N_f=3$, $F^{0}(\mu = 2\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 100.1(3.0)~\text{MeV}$,
where the decay constants read $F^8_\eta=F^8\cos \theta_8$, $F^8_{\eta^\prime}=F^8\sin \theta_8$,
$F^0_\eta=-F^0\sin \theta_0$ and $F^0_{\eta^\prime}=F^0\cos \theta_0$. For the gluonic matrix
elements, we obtain $a_{\eta}(\mu = 2\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 0.0170(10)\,\mathrm{GeV}^{3}$ and $a_{\eta^{\prime}}(\mu
= 2\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 0.0381(84)\,\mathrm{GeV}^{3}$, where statistical and all systematic errors
are added in quadrature.

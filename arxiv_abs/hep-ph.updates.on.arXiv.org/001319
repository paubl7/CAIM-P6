A highly bino-like Dark Matter (DM), which is the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP), could
be motivated by the stringent upper bounds on the DM direct detection rates. This is especially so
when its mass is around or below 100 GeV for which such a bound tends to get most severe. Requiring not
so large a higgsino mass parameter, that would render the scenario reasonably natural, prompts
such a bino-like state to be relatively light. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM),
in the absence of comparably light scalars, such an excitation, if it has to be a thermal relic, is
unable to meet the stringent experimental upper bound on its abundance unless its self-annihilation
hits a funnel involving either the $Z$-boson or the Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson. We demonstrate
that, in such a realistic situation, a highly bino-like DM of the popular $Z_3$-symmetric Next-to-Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) is viable over an extended range of its mass, from our targeted
maximum in the vicinity of the mass of the top quark down to about 30 GeV. This is facilitated by the
presence of comparably light singlet-like states that could serve as funnel (scalars) and/or coannihilating
(singlino) states even as the bino-like LSP receives a minimal (but optimal) tempering triggered
by suitably light higgsino states that, in the first place, evade stringent lower bounds on their
masses that can be derived from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments only in the presence
of a lighter singlino-like state. An involved set of blind spot conditions is derived for the DM direct
detection rates by considering for the very first time the augmented system of neutralinos comprising
of the bino, the higgsinos and the singlino which highlights the important roles played by the NMSSM
parameters $\lambda$ and $\tan\beta$ in delivering a richer phenomenology.

We have explored the shear viscosity and electrical conductivity calculations for bosonic and
fermionic medium, which goes from without to with magnetic field picture and then their simplified
massless expressions. In presence of magnetic field, 5 independent velocity gradient tensors
can be designed, so their corresponding proportional coefficients, connected with the viscous
stress tensor provide us 5 shear viscosity coefficients. In existing litterateurs, two sets of
tensors are available. Starting from them, present work has obtained two sets of expressions for
5 shear viscosity coefficients, which can be ultimately classified into three basic components:
parallel, perpendicular and Hall components as one get same for electrical conductivity at finite
magnetic field. Our calculations are based on kinetic theory approach in relaxation time approximation.
Repeating same mathematical steps for finite magnetic field picture, which traditionally practiced
for without field case, we have obtained 2 sets of 5 shear viscosity components, whose final expressions
are in well agreements with earlier references, although a difference in methodology or steps can
be clearly noticed. Realizing the massless results of viscosity and conductivity for Maxwell-Boltzmann,
Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distribution function, we have applied them for massless quark
gluon plasma and hadronic matter phases, which can provide us a rough order of strength, within which
actual results will vary during quark-hadron phase transition. Present work also indicates that
magnetic field might have some role for building perfect fluid nature in RHIC or LHC matter. The lower
bound expectation of shear viscosity to entropy density ratio is also discussed.

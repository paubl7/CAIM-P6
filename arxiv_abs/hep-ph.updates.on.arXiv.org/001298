We review the present status of the Standard Model calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment
of the muon. This is performed in a perturbative expansion in the fine-structure constant $\alpha$
and is broken down into pure QED, electroweak, and hadronic contributions. The pure QED contribution
is by far the largest and has been evaluated up to and including $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^5)$ with negligible
numerical uncertainty. The electroweak contribution is suppressed by $(m_\mu/M_W)^2$ and only
shows up at the level of the seventh significant digit. It has been evaluated up to two loops and is
known to better than one percent. Hadronic contributions are the most difficult to calculate and
are responsible for almost all of the theoretical uncertainty. The leading hadronic contribution
appears at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)$ and is due to hadronic vacuum polarization, whereas at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^3)$
the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution appears. Given the low characteristic scale
of this observable, these contributions have to be calculated with nonperturbative methods, in
particular, dispersion relations and the lattice approach to QCD. The largest part of this review
is dedicated to a detailed account of recent efforts to improve the calculation of these two contributions
with either a data-driven, dispersive approach, or a first-principle, lattice-QCD approach.
The final result reads $a_\mu^\text{SM}=116\,591\,810(43)\times 10^{-11}$ and is smaller than
the Brookhaven measurement by 3.7$\sigma$. The experimental uncertainty will soon be reduced
by up to a factor four by the new experiment currently running at Fermilab, and also by the future J-PARC
experiment. This and the prospects to further reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the near future-which
are also discussed here-make this quantity one of the most promising places to look for evidence
of new physics.

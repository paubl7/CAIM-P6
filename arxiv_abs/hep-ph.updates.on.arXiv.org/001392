The exceptional region of the parameter space (ERPS) of the two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) is defined
to be the parameter regime where the scalar potential takes on a very special form. In the standard
parameterization of the 2HDM scalar potential with squared mass parameters $m_{11}^2$, $m_{22}^2$,
$m_{12}^2$, and dimensionless couplings, $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, $\ldots,\lambda_7$, the
ERPS corresponds to $\lambda_1=\lambda_2$, $\lambda_7=-\lambda_6$, $m_{11}^2=m_{22}^2$
and $m_{12}^2=0$, corresponding to a scalar potential with an enhanced generalized CP symmetry
called GCP2. Many special features persist if $\lambda_1=\lambda_2$ and $\lambda_7=-\lambda_6$
are retained while allowing for $m_{11}^2\neq m_{22}^2$ and/or $m_{12}^2\neq 0$, corresponding
to a scalar potential with a softly-broken GCP2 symmetry, which we designate as the ERPS4. In this
paper, we examine many of the special features of the ERPS4, as well as even more specialized cases
within the ERPS4 framework in which additional constraints on the scalar potential parameters
are imposed. By surveying the landscape of the ERPS4, we complete the classification of 2HDM scalar
potentials that exhibit an exact Higgs alignment (where the tree-level couplings of one neutral
scalar coincide with those of the Standard Model Higgs boson), due to a residual symmetry that is
unbroken in the vacuum. One surprising aspect of the ERPS4 is the possibility that the scalar sector
is CP-conserving despite the presence of a complex parameter of the scalar potential whose complex
phase cannot be removed by separate rephasings of the two scalar doublet fields. The significance
of the ERPS4 regime for custodial symmetry is also discussed, and the cases where a custodial symmetric
2HDM scalar potential preserves an exact Higgs alignment are elucidated.

Novel emergent phenomena are expected to occur under conditions exceeding the QED critical electric
field, where the vacuum becomes unstable to electron-positron pair production. The required intensity
to reach this regime, $\sim10^{29}\,\mathrm{Wcm^{-2}}$, cannot be achieved even with the most
intense lasers now being planned/constructed without a sizeable Lorentz boost provided by interactions
with ultrarelativistic particles. Seeded laser-laser collisions may access this strong-field
QED regime at laser intensities as low as $\sim10^{24}\,\mathrm{Wcm^{-2}}$. Counterpropagating
e-beam--laser interactions exceed the QED critical field at still lower intensities ($\sim10^{20}\,\mathrm{Wcm^{-2}}$
at $\sim10\,\mathrm{GeV}$). Novel emergent phenomena are predicted to occur in the "QED plasma
regime", where strong-field quantum and collective plasma effects play off one another. Here the
electron beam density becomes a decisive factor. Thus, the challenge is not just to exceed the QED
critical field, but to do so with high quality, approaching solid-density electron beams. Even
though laser wakefield accelerators (LWFA) represent a very promising research field, conventional
accelerators still provide orders of magnitude higher charge densities at energies $\gtrsim10\,\mathrm{GeV}$.
Co-location of extremely dense and highly energetic electron beams with a multi-petawatt laser
system would therefore enable seminal research opportunities in high-field physics and laboratory
astrophysics. This white paper elucidates the potential scientific impact of multi-beam capabilities
that combine a multi-PW optical laser, high-energy/density electron beam, and high-intensity
x rays and outlines how to achieve such capabilities by co-locating a 3-10 PW laser with a state-of-the-art
linear accelerator.

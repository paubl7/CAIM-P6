The $\Lambda$CDM prediction of $S_8\equiv\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ -- where $\sigma_8$
is the root mean square of matter fluctuations on a 8 $h^{-1}$Mpc scale -- once calibrated on Planck
CMB data is $2-3\sigma$ lower than its direct estimate by a number of weak lensing surveys. In this
paper, we explore the possibility that the '$S_8$-tension' is due to a non-thermal hot dark matter
(HDM) fractional contribution to the universe energy density leading to a power suppression at
small-scales in the matter power spectrum. Any HDM models can be characterized by its effective
mass $ m_{sp}^{\rm eff}$ and its contribution to the relativistic degrees of freedom at CMB decoupling
$\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Taking the specific example of a sterile particle produced from the decay
of the inflaton during a matter dominated era, we find that from Planck only the tension can be reduced
below $2\sigma$, but Planck does not favor a non-zero ${m_{sp}^{\rm eff},\Delta N_{\rm eff}}$.
In combination with a measurement of $S_8$ from KIDS1000+BOSS+2dfLenS, the $S_8$-tension would
hint at the existence of a particle of mass $ m_{sp}^{\rm eff} \simeq 0.67_{-0.48}^{+0.26}$ ${\rm
eV}$ with a contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \simeq0.06\pm0.05$. However, Pantheon and BOSS
BAO/$f\sigma_8$ data restricts the particle mass to $m_{sp}^{\rm eff} \simeq 0.48_{-0.36}^{+0.17}$
and contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \simeq 0.046_{-0.031}^{+0.004}$. We discuss implications
of our results for other canonical non-thermal HDM models -- the Dodelson-Widrow model and a thermal
sterile particle with a different temperature in the hidden sector. We report competitive results
on such hidden sector temperature which might have interesting implications for particle physics
model building, in particular connecting the $S_8$-tension to the longstanding short baseline
oscillation anomaly.

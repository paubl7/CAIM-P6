We estimate the thermoelectric response, namely, the Seebeck coefficient of a hot and deconfined
plasma of quarks and gluons, created post ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions in the presence
of a weak, homogeneous background magnetic field. We employ the kinetic theory framework, wherein
we use the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time approximation. In-medium
interactions are taken into account via the quasiparticle masses of the partons extracted from
one loop perturbative thermal QCD. We calculate the individual Seebeck coefficients of the quark
species from which we show that the Seebeck coefficient of the medium can be obtained as a weighted
average. Both the individual and total Seebeck coefficients are seen to decrease with temperature
and increase with the chemical potential. We find that a larger current quark mass has an amplifying
effect on the individual Seebeck coefficient in the presence of a weak magnetic field. We also draw
comparisons of Seebeck coefficients between the cases of weak and strong background magnetic field.
We observe that the temperature sensitivities of the individual Seebeck coefficients increase
with the current mass of the quark species in the case of a weak magnetic field whereas the same records
a decreasing trend for strong magnetic field. The total Seebeck coefficient in weak magnetic field
has a feeble positive magnitude and variation with temperature, quite different from the behaviour
of the individual coefficients. This is a consequence of the weighted average prescription that
we use to calculate the total Seebeck coefficient from the individual ones. For the composite medium,
the magnitude and sign of the Seebeck coefficient and its variation with temperature, for the weak
$B$ case is found to be significantly different from the strong $B$ case.

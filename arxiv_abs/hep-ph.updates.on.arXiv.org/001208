An analysis is presented of elastic $P$-wave $\pi\pi$ phase shifts and inelasticities up to 2 GeV,
aimed at identifying the corresponding $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ excited $\rho$ resonances and focusing
on the $\rho(1250)$ vs. $\rho(1450)$ controversy. The approach employs an improved parametrization
in terms of a manifestly unitary and analytic three-channel $S$-matrix with its complex-energy
pole positions. The included channels are $\pi\pi$, $\rho2\pi$, and $\rho\rho$, the latter two
being effective in the sense that they mimic several experimentally observed decay modes with nearby
thresholds. In an alternative fit, the $\rho2\pi$ mode is replaced by $\omega\pi$, which is also
an experimentally relevant channel. The improvement with respect to prior work amounts to the enforcement
of maximum crossing symmetry through once-subtracted dispersion relations called GKPY equations.
A separate analysis concerns the pion electromagnetic form factor, which again demonstrates the
enormous importance of guaranteeing unitarity and analyticity when dealing with very broad and
highly inelastic resonances. In the case of $\rho(1250)$ vs. $\rho(1450)$, the failure to do so
is shown to give rise to an error in the predicted mass of about 170 MeV. A clear picture emerges from
these analyses, identifying five vector $\rho$ states below 2 GeV, viz. $\rho(770)$, $\rho(1250)$,
$\rho(1450)$, $\rho(1600)$, and $\rho(1800)$, with $\rho(1250)$ being indisputably the most
important excited $\rho$ resonance. The stability of the fits as well as the imposition of unitarity,
analyticity, and approximate crossing symmetry in the analyses lend very strong support to these
assignments. The possibly far-reaching consequences for meson spectroscopy are discussed.

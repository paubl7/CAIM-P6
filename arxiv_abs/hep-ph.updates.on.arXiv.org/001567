In this paper we explore practicable ways for self-consistent calculations of spectral functions
from analytically continued functional renormalization group (aFRG) flow equations. As a particularly
straightforward one we propose to include parametrizations of self-energies based on explicit
analytic one-loop expressions. To exemplify this scheme we calculate the spectral functions of
pion and sigma meson of the $O(4)$ model at vanishing temperature in the broken phase. Comparing
the results with those from previous aFRG calculations, we explicitly demonstrate how self-consistency
at all momenta fixes the tight relation between particle masses and decay thresholds. In addition,
the two-point functions from our new semi-analytic FRG scheme have the desired domain of holomorphy
built in and can readily be studied in the entire cut-complex frequency plane, on physical as well
as other Riemann sheets. This is very illustrative and allows, for example, to trace the flow of the
resonance pole of the sigma meson across an unphysical sheet. In order to assess the limitations
due to the underlying one-loop structure, we also introduce a fully self-consistent numerical
scheme based on spectral representations with scale-dependent spectral functions. The most notable
improvement of this numerically involved calculation is that it describes the three-particle
resonance decay of an off-shell pion, $\pi^* \to \sigma\pi\to3\pi$. Apart from this further conceptual
improvement, overall agreement with the results from the considerably simpler semi-analytic
one-loop scheme is very encouraging, however. The latter can therefore provide a sound and practicable
basis for self-consistent calculations of spectral functions in more realistic effective theories
for warm and dense matter.

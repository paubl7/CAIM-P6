In $B_c^- \to J/\psi (\to \mu^+ \mu^-)\tau^-\bar{\nu}_\tau$ decay, the three-momentum $\boldsymbol{p}_{\tau^-}$
cannot be determined accurately due to the decay products of $\tau^-$ inevitably include an undetected
$\nu_{\tau}$. As a consequence, the angular distribution of this decay cannot be measured. In this
work, we construct a {\it measurable} angular distribution by considering the subsequent decay
$\tau^- \to \pi^- \nu_\tau$. The full cascade decay is $B_c^- \to J/\psi (\to \mu^+ \mu^-)\tau^-
(\to \pi^- \nu_\tau)\bar{\nu}_\tau$, in which the three-momenta $\boldsymbol{p}_{\mu^+}$,
$\boldsymbol{p}_{\mu^-}$, and $\boldsymbol{p}_{\pi^-}$ can be measured. The five-fold differential
angular distribution containing all Lorentz structures of the new physics (NP) effective operators
can be written in terms of twelve angular observables $\mathcal{I}_i (q^2, E_\pi)$. Integrating
over the energy of pion $E_\pi$, we construct twelve normalized angular observables $\widehat{\mathcal{I}}_i(q^2)$
and two lepton-flavor-universality ratios $R(P_{L,T}^{J/\psi})(q^2)$. Based on the $B_c \to
J/\psi$ form factors calculated by the latest lattice QCD and sum rule, we predict the $q^2$ distribution
of all $\widehat{\mathcal{I}}_i$ and $R(P_{L,T}^{J/\psi})$ both within the Standard Model and
in eight NP benchmark points. We find that the benchmark BP2 (corresponding to the hypothesis of
tensor operator) has the greatest effect on all $\widehat{\mathcal{I}}_{i}$ and $R(P_{L,T}^{J/\psi})$,
except $\widehat{\mathcal{I}}_{5}$. The ratios $R(P_{L,T}^{J/\psi})$ are more sensitive to
the NP with pseudo-scalar operators than the $\widehat{\mathcal{I}}_{i}$. Finally, we discuss
the symmetries in the angular observables and present a model-independent method to determine
the existence of tensor operators.

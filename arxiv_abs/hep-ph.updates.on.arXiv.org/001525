We present an $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ Standard Model calculation of the inner radiative corrections
to Gamow-Teller $\beta$ decays. We find that \textit{a priori} contributions arise from the photonic
vertex correction and $\gamma W$ box diagram. Upon evaluation most elastic contributions vanish
due to crossing symmetry or cancellation between isoscalar and isovector photonic contributions,
leaving only the polarized parity-odd contribution, i.e., the Gamow-Teller equivalent of the
well-known axial $\gamma W$ box contribution for Fermi decays. We show that weak magnetism contributes
significantly to the Born amplitude, and consider additional hadronic contributions at low energy
using a holomorphic continuation of the polarized Bjorken sum rule constrained by experimental
data. We perform the same procedure for the Fermi inner radiative correction through a combination
of the running of Bjorken and Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rules. We discuss heavy flavor, higher-twist,
and target mass corrections and find a significant increase at low momentum from the latter. We find
$\Delta_R^A = 0.02532(22)$ and $\Delta_R^V = 0.02473(27)$ for axial and vector inner radiative
corrections, respectively, resulting in $\Delta_R^A-\Delta_R^V=0.60(5) \times 10^{-3}$,
which allows us to extract $g_A^0$ for the first time to our knowledge. We discuss consequences for
comparing experimental data to lattice calculations in beyond Standard Model fits. Further, we
show how some traditional $\beta$ decay calculations contain part of this effect but fail to account
for cancellations in the full $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$result. Finally, we correct for a double-counting
instance in the isospin $T=1/2$ mirror decay extraction of $|V_{ud}|$, the up-down matrix element
of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, resolving a long-standing tension and leading to increased
precision.

We propose a model of fermion masses and mixings based on $SU(5)$ grand unified theory (GUT) and a
$D_{4}$ flavor symmetry. This is the first comprehensive study of a 4D $SU(5)$ GUT with a flavor symmetry
that does not contain a triplet irreducible representation. The Yukawa matrices of quarks and charged
leptons are obtained after integrating out heavy messenger fields from renormalizable superpotentials
while neutrino masses originate from the type I seesaw mechanism. The group theoretical factors
from 24- and 45-dimensional Higgs fields lead to ratios between the Yukawa couplings in agreement
with data, while the dangerous proton decay operators are highly suppressed. By performing a numerical
fit, we find that the model captures accurately the mixing angles, the Yukawa couplings and the $CP$
phase of the quark sector at the GUT scale. The neutrino masses are generated at the renormalizable
level with the prediction of trimaximal mixing while an additional effective operator is required
to account for the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). The model is remarkably predictive because
only the normal neutrino mass ordering and the lower octant of the atmospheric angle are allowed
while the $CP$ conserving values of the Dirac neutrino phase $\delta_{CP}$ are excluded. Moreover,
the predicted values of the effective Majorana mass $m_{\beta \beta}$ can be tested at future neutrinoless
double beta decay experiments. An analytical and a numerical study of the BAU via the leptogenesis
mechanism is performed. We focused on the regions of parameter space where leptogenesis from the
lightest right-handed neutrino is successfully realized. Strong correlations between the parameters
of the neutrino sector and the observed BAU are obtained.

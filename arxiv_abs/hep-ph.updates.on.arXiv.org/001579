The quartic gauge boson couplings that identify the strengths of the gauge boson self-interactions
are exactly determined by the non-Abelian gauge nature of the Standard Model. The examination of
these couplings at $ep$ collisions with high center-of-mass energy and high integrated luminosity
provides an important opportunity to test the validity of the Standard Model and the existence of
new physics beyond the Standard Model. The quartic gauge boson couplings can contribute directly
to multi-boson production at colliders. Therefore, we examine the potential of the process $ep
\rightarrow \nu_{e}W^{+}W^{-} j$ at the Large Hadron Electron Collider and the Future Circular
Collider-hadron electron to study non-standard $WWWW$ couplings in a model independent way by
means of the effective Lagrangian approach. We present an investigation on measuring $W^{+}W^{-}$
production in pure leptonic and semileptonic decay channels. In addition, we calculate the sensitivity
limits at $95\%$ Confidence Level on the anomalous $\frac{f_{M0}}{\Lambda^{4}}$, $\frac{f_{M1}}{\Lambda^{4}}$,
$\frac{f_{M7}}{\Lambda^{4}}$, $\frac{f_{S0}}{\Lambda^{4}}$, $\frac{f_{S1}}{\Lambda^{4}}$,
$\frac{f_{T0}}{\Lambda^{4}}$, $\frac{f_{T1}}{\Lambda^{4}}$ and $\frac{f_{T2}}{\Lambda^{4}}$
couplings obtained by dimension-8 operators through the process $ep \rightarrow \nu_{e}W^{+}W^{-}
j$ for the Large Hadron Electron Collider and the Future Circular Hadron Electron Collider's different
center-of-mass energies and integrated luminosities. Our results show that with the process $ep
\rightarrow \nu_{e}W^{+}W^{-} j$ at the Large Hadron Electron Collider and the Future Circular
Collider-hadron electron the sensitivity estimated on the anomalous $WWWW$ couplings can be importantly
strengthened.

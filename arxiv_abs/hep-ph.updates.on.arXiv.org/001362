It is customary to apply the so-called narrow width approximation $\Gamma(B\to RP_3\to P_1P_2P_3)=\Gamma(B\to
RP_3)Br(R\to P_1P_2)$ to extract the branching fraction of the quasi-two-body decay $B\to RP_3$,
with $R$ and $P_3$ being an intermediate resonant state and a pseudoscalar meson, respectively.
However, the above factorization is valid only in the zero width limit. We consider a correction
parameter $\eta_R$ from finite width effects. Our main results are: (i) We present a general framework
for computing $\eta_R$ and show that it can be expressed in terms of the normalized differential
rate and determined by its value at the resonance. (ii) We introduce a form factor $F(s_{12},m_R)$
for the strong coupling involved in the $R(m_{12})\to P_1P_2$ decay when $m_{12}$ is away from $m_R$.
We find that off-shell effects are small in vector meson productions, but prominent in the $K_2^*(1430)$,
$\sigma/f_0(500)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$ resonances. (iii) We evaluate $\eta_R$ in the theoretical
framework of QCD factorization (QCDF) and in the experimental parameterization (EXPP) for three-body
decay amplitudes. In general, $\eta_R^{\rm QCDF}$ and $\eta_R^{\rm EXPP}$ are similar for vector
mesons, but different for tensor and scalar resonances. A study of the differential rates enables
us to understand the origin of their differences. (iv) Finite-width corrections to $Br(B^-\to
RP)_{\rm NWA}$ obtained in the narrow width approximation are generally small, less than 10\%,
but they are prominent in $B^-\to\sigma/f_0(500)\pi^-$ and $B^-\to \overline K_0^{*0}(1430)\pi^-$
decays. The EXPP of the normalized differential rates should be contrasted with the theoretical
predictions from QCDF calculation as the latter properly takes into account the energy dependence
in weak decay amplitudes.

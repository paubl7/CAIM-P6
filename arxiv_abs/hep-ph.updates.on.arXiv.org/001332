The success of primordial nucleosynthesis as a cornerstone of the hot Big Bang model has been limited
by the long-standing lithium problem. Recent work presented a self-consistent perturbative analysis
of the effects of variations in nature's fundamental constants on primordial nucleosynthesis
for a broad class of grand unified theory models, showing that such models provide a possible solution
to the lithium problem, provided the value of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ at the nucleosynthesis
epoch is larger than the current laboratory one by a few parts per million of relative variation.
Here we extend the earlier analysis, focusing on how this preferred value of $\alpha$ is affected
if relevant cosmological parameters are also allowed to vary--specifically focusing on the baryon-to-photon
ratio, the number of neutrinos, and the neutron lifetime. We rephrase the lithium problem in terms
of the values of these parameters that would be needed to solve it within this class of grand unified
theories, thus obtaining values that would disagree with the results of other experiments by several
standard deviations. Using these experimental results as priors in the analysis, we find that a
larger value of $\alpha$ is still preferred, confirming our previous results. By excluding lithium
from the analysis, we also obtain upper limits on possible variations of $\alpha$ at the primordial
nucleosynthesis epoch. At the two-sigma level, these are $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|<50$ ppm without
nuclear physics, cosmology, or atomic clocks priors, or alternatively $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|<5$
ppm if these priors are used. While the simplest solution to the lithium problem is likely to be found
within observational astrophysics, our work shows that varying fundamental constants remain
a viable alternative.

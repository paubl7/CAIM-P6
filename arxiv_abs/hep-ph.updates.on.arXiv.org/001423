Minimal gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model has long been known to be able to explain the tension
between the theoretical and experimental values of the muon magnetic moment. It has been explored
and tested extensively, pushing the viable parameter space into a very tight corner. Further, embedding
the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model in a supersymmetric (SUSY) framework has been shown to relax some
of these constraints and has recently been shown to explain the electron anomalous magnetic moment
as well. In this model, the logarithm of the mass ratio of third to second generation (s)leptons control
the non-negligible kinetic mixing and may crucially alter many of the constraints. We confront
both the non-SUSY and SUSY versions of this class of models with the CsI(2017), the recently released
CENNS10 data from the liquid Argon detector as well as the updated CsI(2020) data of the COHERENT
experiment. We use the recoil energy and timing binned data from CsI(2017) and the energy, time and
PSD binned data from CENNS10 to find estimates for the model parameters in a likelihood maximization
test. We also show updated exclusions using all of the above data from the COHERENT Collaboration,
as well as projected exclusions from the ongoing Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment. The
$(g-2)_\mu$ favored values of the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge coupling that are still unconstrained
overlaps with the estimates from COHERENT data within $1\sigma$. The combined COHERENT data is
found to prefer the presence of the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge boson over the SM at $\sim1.4\sigma$.
The global minima of a chi-square deviation function using CsI(2020) as well as CENNS10 total counts
has significant overlap with the $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$ favored parameter space in the context of SUSY
$L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$ model.

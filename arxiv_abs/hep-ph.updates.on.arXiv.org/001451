We study the evolution of the matter-antimatter asymmetry ({\eta}), the vorticity, and the hypermagnetic
field in the symmetric phase of the early Universe, and in the temperature range 100 GeV < T < 10 TeV.
We assume a configuration for the hypermagnetic field which includes both helical and non-helical
(Bz) components. Consequently, the hypermagnetic field and the fluid vorticity can directly affect
each other, the manifestations of which we explore in three scenarios. In the first scenario, we
show that in the presence of a small vorticity and a large {\eta}eR, helicity can be generated and
amplified for an initially strong Bz. The generation of the helical seed is due to the chiral vortical
effect (CVE) and/or the advection term, while its growth is mainly due to the chiral magnetic effect
(CME) which leads to the production of the baryon asymmetry, as well. The vorticity saturates to
a nonzero value which depends on Bz, even in the presence of the viscosity, due to the back-reaction
of Bz on the plasma. Increasing the initial vorticity, makes the values of the helicity, {\eta}s,
and vorticity reach their saturation curves sooner, but does not change their final values at the
onset of the electroweak phase transition. The second scenario is similar to the first except we
assume that all initial {\eta}s are zero. We find that much higher initial vorticity is required
for the generation process. In the third scenario, we show that in the presence of only a strong hypermagnetic
field, {\eta}s and vorticity can be generated and amplified. Increasing the initial helicity,
increases the final {\eta}s and vorticity. We find that although the presence of a nonzero initial
Bz is necessary in all three scenarios, its increase only increases the final values of vorticity.

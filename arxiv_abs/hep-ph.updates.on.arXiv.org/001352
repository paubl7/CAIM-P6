The present paper is the first in a series that addresses the calculation of the full one-loop corrections
of dark matter (DM) annihilation cross-sections in the low mass region of the inert doublet model
(IDM). We first review the renormalisation of the model both in a fully on-shell (OS) scheme and a
mixed scheme combining on-shell (for the masses) and a $\overline{{\rm MS}}$ approach when the
partial invisible width is closed and does not allow the use of a full OS scheme. The scale dependence
introduced by the mixed scheme is shown to be tracked through an analysis of a parametrisation of
the tree-level cross-section and the $\beta$ constant of a specific coupling. We discuss how to
minimise the scale dependence. The theoretical uncertainty brought by the scale dependence leads
us to introduce a new criterion on the perturbativity of the IDM. This criterion further delimits
the allowed parameter space which we investigate carefully by including a host of constraints,
both theoretical and experimental, including in particular, new data from the LHC. We come up with
a set of benchmark points that cover three different mechanisms for a viable relic density of DM:
{\it i)} a dominance of co-annihilation into a fermion pair, { \it ii)} annihilation into 2 vector
bosons of which one is off-shell that requires the calculation of a $2 \to 3$ process at one-loop,
{\it iii)} annihilation that proceeds through the very narrow standard model Higgs resonance.
Since the $2 \to 3$ vector boson channel features in all three channels and is essentially a build
up on the simpler annihilation to OS vector bosons, we study the latter in detail in the present paper.
We confirm again that the corrected cross-sections involve a parameter that represents rescattering
in the dark sector that a tree-level computation in not sensitive to.

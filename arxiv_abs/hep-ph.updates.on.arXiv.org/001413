In this article, there are 18 sections discussing various current topics in the field of relativistic
heavy-ion collisions and related phenomena, which will serve as a snapshot of the current state
of the art. Section 1 reviews experimental results of some recent light-flavored particle production
data from ALICE collaboration. Other sections are mostly theoretical in nature. Very strong but
transient magnetic field created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions could have important observational
consequences. This has generated a lot of theoretical activity in the last decade. Sections 2, 7,
9, 10 and 11 deal with the effects of the magnetic field on the properties of the QCD matter. There are
several unanswered questions about the QCD phase diagram. Sections 3, 11 and 18 discuss various
aspects of the QCD phase diagram and phase transitions. Recent years have witnessed interesting
developments in foundational aspects of hydrodynamics and their application to heavy-ion collisions.
Sections 12, 15, 16 and 17 of this article probe some aspects of this exciting field. Transport coefficients
together with their temperature- and density-dependence, are essential inputs in hydrodynamical
calculations. Sections 5, 8 and 14 deal with calculation/estimation of various transport coefficients
(shear and bulk viscosity, thermal conductivity, relaxation times, etc.) of quark matter and hadronic
matter. Sections 4, 6 and 13 deals with interesting new developments in the field. Section 4 discusses
color dipole gluon distribution function at small transverse momentum in the form of a series of
Bells polynomials. Section 6 discusses the properties of Higgs boson in the quark gluon plasma using
Higgs-quark interaction. Section 13 discusses modification of coalescence model to incorporate
viscous corrections and application of this model.

The low-energy spectrum and scattering of two-nucleon systems are studied with lattice quantum
chromodynamics using a variational approach. A wide range of interpolating operators are used:
dibaryon operators built from products of plane-wave nucleons, hexaquark operators built from
six localized quarks, and quasi-local operators inspired by two-nucleon bound-state wavefunctions
in low-energy effective theories. Sparsening techniques are used to compute the timeslice-to-all
quark propagators required to form correlation-function matrices using products of these operators.
Projection of these matrices onto irreducible representations of the cubic group, including spin-orbit
coupling, is detailed. Variational methods are applied to constrain the low-energy spectra of
two-nucleon systems in a single finite volume with quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of 806
MeV. Results for S- and D-wave phase shifts in the isospin singlet and triplet channels are obtained
under the assumption that partial-wave mixing is negligible. Tests of interpolating-operator
dependence are used to investigate the reliability of the energy spectra obtained and highlight
both the strengths and weaknesses of variational methods. These studies and comparisons to previous
studies using the same gauge-field ensemble demonstrate that interpolating-operator dependence
can lead to significant effects on the two-nucleon energy spectra obtained using both variational
and non-variational methods, including missing energy levels and other discrepancies. While
this study is inconclusive regarding the presence of two-nucleon bound states at this quark mass,
it provides robust upper bounds on two-nucleon energy levels that can be improved in future calculations
using additional interpolating operators and is therefore a step toward reliable nuclear spectroscopy
from the underlying Standard Model of particle physics.

We present our computation of the ${\cal O}((\alpha_t+\alpha_\lambda+\alpha_\kappa)^2)$ two-loop
corrections to the Higgs boson masses of the CP-violating Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (NMSSM) using the Feynman-diagrammatic approach in the gaugeless limit at vanishing external
momentum. We choose a mixed $\overline{\mbox{DR}}$-on-shell (OS) renormalisation scheme for
the Higgs sector and apply both $\overline{\mbox{DR}}$ and OS renormalisation in the top/stop
sector. For the treatment of the infrared divergences we apply and compare three different regularisation
methods: the introduction of a regulator mass, the application of a small momentum expansion, and
the inclusion of the full momentum dependence. Our new corrections have been implemented in the
Fortran code NMSSMCALC that computes the Higgs mass spectrum of the CP-conserving and CP-violating
NMSSM as well as the Higgs boson decays including the state-of-the-art higher-order corrections.
Our numerical analysis shows that the newly computed corrections increase with rising $\lambda$
and $\kappa$, remaining overall below about 3\% compared to our previously computed ${\cal O}(\alpha_t(\alpha_t+\alpha_s))$
corrections, in the region compatible with perturbativity below the GUT scale. The renormalisation
scheme and scale dependence is of typical two-loop order. The impact of the CP-violating phases
in the new corrections is small. We furthermore show that the Goldstone Boson Catastrophe due to
the infrared divergences can be treated in a numerically efficient way by introducing a regulator
mass that approximates the momentum-dependent results best for squared mass values in the permille
range of the squared renormalisation scale. Our results mark another step forward in the program
of increasing the precision in the NMSSM Higgs boson observables.

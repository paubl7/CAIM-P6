To date, modern three-dimensional (3D) supernova (SN) simulations have not demonstrated that
explosion energies of 10^{51} erg (=1 bethe = 1B) or more are possible for neutrino-driven SNe of
non/slow-rotating M < 20 solar-mass progenitors. We present the first such model, considering
a non-rotating, solar-metallicity 18.88 solar-mass progenitor, whose final 7 minutes of convective
oxygen-shell burning were simulated in 3D and showed a violent oxygen-neon shell merger prior to
collapse. A large set of 3D SN-models was computed with the Prometheus-Vertex code, whose improved
convergence of the two-moment equations with Boltzmann closure allows now to fully exploit the
implicit neutrino-transport treatment. Nuclear burning is treated with a 23-species network.
We vary the angular grid resolution and consider different nuclear equations of state and muon formation
in the proto-neutron star (PNS), which requires six-species transport with coupling of all neutrino
flavors across all energy-momentum groups. Elaborate neutrino transport was applied until ~2
seconds after bounce. In one case the simulation was continued to >7 seconds with an approximate
treatment of neutrino effects that allows for seamless continuation without transients. A spherically
symmetric neutrino-driven wind does not develop. Instead, accretion downflows to the PNS and outflows
of neutrino-heated matter establish a monotonic rise of the explosion energy until ~7 seconds post
bounce, when the outgoing shock reaches about 50,000 km and enters the He-layer. The converged value
of the explosion energy at infinity (with overburden subtracted) is roughly 1B and the ejected 56Ni
mass up to 0.087 solar masses, both within a few 10 percent of the SN 1987A values. The final NS mass
and kick are about 1.65 solar masses and over 450 km/s, respectively.

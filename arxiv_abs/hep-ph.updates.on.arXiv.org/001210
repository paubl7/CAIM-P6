We review the current status of baryogenesis with emphasis on electroweak baryogenesis and leptogenesis.
The first detailed studies were carried out for SU(5) GUT models where CP-violating decays of leptoquarks
generate a baryon asymmetry. These GUT models were excluded by the discovery of B+L violating sphaleron
processes at high temperatures. Yet a new possibility emerged, electroweak baryogenesis. Here
sphaleron processes generate a baryon asymmetry during a strongly first-order phase transition.
This mechanism has been studied in many extensions of the Standard Model. However, constraints
from the LHC and from low-energy precision experiments exclude most of the known models, leaving
composite Higgs models of electroweak symmetry breaking as an interesting possibility. Sphaleron
processes are also the basis of leptogenesis, where CP-violating decays of heavy right-handed
neutrinos generate a lepton asymmetry which is partially converted to a baryon asymmetry. This
mechanism is closely related to the one of GUT baryogenesis, and simple estimates based on GUT models
can explain the order of magnitude of the observed baryon-to-photon ratio. In the one-flavour approximation
an upper bound on the light neutrino masses has been derived which is consistent with the cosmological
upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses. For quasi-degenerate right-handed neutrinos the leptogenesis
temperature can be lowered from the GUT scale down to the weak scale, and CP-violating oscillations
of GeV sterile neutinos can also lead to successfull leptogenesis. Significant progress has been
made in developing a full field theoretical description of thermal leptogenesis, which demonstrated
that interactions with gauge bosons of the thermal plasma play a crucial role. Finally, we discuss
recent ideas how the seesaw mechanism and B-L breaking at the GUT scale can be probed by gravitational
waves.

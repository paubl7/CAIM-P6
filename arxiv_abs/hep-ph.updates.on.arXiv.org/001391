We develop a non-perturbative model for valence parton distribution functions (PDFs) based on
the quark interactions in the mean field of the nucleonic interior. The main motivation for the model
is to obtain a mean field description of the valence quarks as a baseline to study the short range quark-quark
interactions that generate high $x$ tail of valence quark distributions. The model is based on the
separation of valence three-quark system from the residual nucleon system which is the source of
the mean field. The nucleon structure function is calculated within effective light-front diagrammatic
approach which allows to introduce light-front valence quark and residual wave functions. The
model allows us to obtain a new relation between the position of the peak of $xq_V(x)$ distribution
of the valence quark and the effective mass of the residual system, $m_R$: $x_{peak} \approx {1\over
4} (1-{m_R\over m_N})$ and naturally explains the difference in the peak positions for d- and u-
quarks due to expected larger residual mass in the case of valence d- quark distribution. The parameters
of the model are fixed by fitting the calculated valence quark distributions to the phenomenological
parameterizations. This allowed us to estimate the total contribution due to quark-quark correlations
which are expected to dominate at high x. The fit allowed also to obtain the $Q^2$ dependence of the
mass of the residual system and its effective size which gives a new insight on the effects of the QCD
evolution on strongly interacting mean field of the nucleon. Finally, the evaluated parameters
of non-perturbative wave functions of valence 3q- and residual system allow them to be used in calculations
of other observables such as nucleon form factors, generalized partonic and transverse momentum
distributions.

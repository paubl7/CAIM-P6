We extend the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM) - constructed for the description
of non-perturbative QCD phenomena of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (QGP) - to large
baryon chemical potentials including a critical end-point (CEP) and a 1st order phase transition.
The DQPM is based on covariant propagators for quarks/antiquarks and gluons that have a finite width
in their spectral functions. In DQPM the determination of complex selfenergies for the partonic
degrees-of-freedom at zero and finite $\mu_B$ has been performed by adjusting the entropy density
to the lattice QCD data. The temperature-dependent effective coupling (squared) $g^2(T/T_c)$,
as well as the effective masses and widths or the partons are based in this adjustment. The novel extended
dynamical quasi-particle model, named "DQPM-CP", makes it possible to describe thermodynamical
and transport properties of quarks and gluons in a wide range of temperature, $T$, and baryon chemical
potential, $\mu_B$, and reproduces the equation-of-state (EoS) of lattice QCD calculations in
the crossover region of finite $T, \mu_B$. We apply a scaling ansatz for the strong coupling constant
near the CEP, located at ($T^{CEP}$, $\mu^{CEP}_B) = (0.100, 0.960)$ GeV. We show the EoS as well
as the speed of sound for $T>T_c$ and for a wide range of $\mu_B$, which can be of interest for hydrodynamical
simulations. Furthermore, we consider two settings for the strange quark chemical potentials
(I) $\mu_q=\mu_u=\mu_s=\mu_B/3$ and (II) $\mu_s=0,\mu_u=\mu_d=\mu_B/3$. The isentropic trajectories
of the QGP matter are compared for these two cases. The phase diagram of DQPM-CP is close to PNJL calculations.
The leading order pQCD transport coefficients of both approaches differ. This elucidates that
the knowledge of the phase diagram alone is not sufficient to describe the dynamical evolution of
strongly interacting matter.

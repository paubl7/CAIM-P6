We apply the formalism developed earlier for studying transverse momentum dependent parton distribution
functions (TMDs) at small Bjorken $x$ to construct the small-$x$ asymptotics of the quark Sivers
function. First, we explicitly construct the complete fundamental "polarized Wilson line" operator
to sub-sub-eikonal order: this object can be used to study a variety of quark TMDs at small-$x$. We
then express the quark Sivers function in terms of dipole scattering amplitudes containing various
components of the "polarized Wilson line" and show that the dominant (eikonal) term which contributes
to the quark Sivers function at small $x$ is the spin-dependent odderon, confirming the recent results
of Dong, Zheng and Zhou. Our conclusion is also similar to the case of the gluon Sivers function derived
by Boer, Echevarria, Mulders and Zhou (see also the work by Szymanowski and Zhou). We also analyze
the sub-eikonal corrections to the quark Sivers function using the constructed "polarized Wilson
line" operator. We derive new small-$x$ evolution equations re-summing double-logarithmic powers
of $\alpha_s \, \ln^2 (1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant. We solve the corresponding
novel evolution equations in the large-$N_c$ limit, obtaining a sub-eikonal correction to the
spin-dependent odderon contribution. We conclude that the quark Sivers function at small $x$ receives
contributions from two terms and is given by \begin{align} f_{1 \: T}^{\perp \: q} (x, k_T^2) = C_O
(x, k_T^2) \, \frac{1}{x} + C_1 (k_T^2) \, \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)^0 + \ldots \end{align} with
the function $C_O (x, k_T^2)$ varying slowly with $x$ and the ellipsis denoting the sub-asymptotic
and sub-sub-eikonal (order-$x$) corrections.

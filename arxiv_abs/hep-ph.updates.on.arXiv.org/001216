We study the impact of steady, homogeneous, and external parallel electric and magnetic field strength
($eE\parallel eB$), on the chiral symmetry breaking-restoration and confinement-deconfinement
phase transitions. We also sketch the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at finite temperature
$T$ and in the presence of background fields. Our unified formalism for this study is based on the
Schwinger-Dyson equations, symmetry preserving vector-vector contact interaction model of
quarks, and the proper time regularization scheme. At $T=0$, in the purely magnetic case ($eE\rightarrow
0$), we observe the well known magnetic catalysis effect. On the other hand, in the pure electric
field background ($eB\rightarrow 0$), the electric field tends to restore the chiral symmetry
and deconfinement above the pseudo-critical electric field $eE^{\chi, C}_c$. In the presence
of both $eE$ and $eB$: we find the magnetic catalysis effect in the particular region where $eB$ dominates
over $eE$, whereas, we observe the chiral inhibition (or electric chiral rotation) effect, when
$eE$ stand over $eB$. At finite $T$, in the pure electric field case, the phenomenon of inverse electric
catalysis appears to exist in our model. On the other hand for pure magnetic field background, we
notice the magnetic catalysis effect in the mean-field approximation and inverse magnetic catalysis
with $eB$-dependent coupling. The combined effect of both $eE$ and $eB$ on the pseudo-critical
$T^{\chi, C}_c$ yields the inverse electromagnetic catalysis, with and without $eB-$dependent
effective coupling of the model. Our findings are satisfactory in agreement with already predicted
results by lattice simulations and other reliable effective models of QCD.

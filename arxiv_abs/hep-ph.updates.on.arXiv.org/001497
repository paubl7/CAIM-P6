New physics increasing the expansion rate just prior to recombination is among the least unlikely
solutions to the Hubble tension, and would be expected to leave an important signature in the early
Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (eISW) effect, a source of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies
arising from the time-variation of gravitational potentials when the Universe was not completely
matter dominated. Why, then, is there no clear evidence for new physics from the CMB alone, and why
does the $\Lambda$CDM model fit CMB data so well? These questions and the vastness of the Hubble tension
theory model space motivate general consistency tests of $\Lambda$CDM. I perform an eISW-based
consistency test of $\Lambda$CDM introducing the parameter $A_{\rm eISW}$, which rescales the
eISW contribution to the CMB power spectra. A fit to Planck CMB data yields $A_{\rm eISW}=0.988 \pm
0.027$, in perfect agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM expectation $A_{\rm eISW}=1$, and posing an
important challenge for early-time new physics, which I illustrate in a case study focused on early
dark energy (EDE). I explicitly show that the increase in $\omega_c$ needed for EDE to preserve the
fit to the CMB, which has been argued to worsen the fit to weak lensing and galaxy clustering measurements,
is specifically required to lower the amplitude of the eISW effect, which would otherwise exceed
$\Lambda$CDM's prediction by $\approx 20\%$: this is a generic problem beyond EDE and likely applying
to most models enhancing the expansion rate around recombination. Early-time new physics models
invoked to address the Hubble tension are therefore faced with the significant challenge of making
a similar prediction to $\Lambda$CDM for the eISW effect, while not degrading the fit to other measurements
in doing so.

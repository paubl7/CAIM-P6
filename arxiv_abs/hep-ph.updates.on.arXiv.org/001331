By focusing on the simple $w\neq-1$ extension to $\Lambda$CDM, we assess which epoch(s) possibly
source the $H_0$-tension. We consider Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data in three possible
ways: $i)$ complete CMB data; $ii)$ excluding the $l<30$ temperature and polarization likelihoods;
$iii)$ imposing early universe priors, that disentangle early and late time physics. Through a
joint analysis with low-redshift supernovae type-Ia and gravitationally lensed time delay datasets,
{and neglecting galaxy clustering Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data}, we find that the
inclusion of early universe CMB priors is consistent with the local estimate of $H_0$ while excluding
the low-$l$+lowE likelihoods mildly relaxes the tension. This is in contrast to joint analyses
with the complete CMB data. Our simple implementation of contrasting the effect of different CMB
priors on the $H_0$ estimate shows that the early universe information from the CMB data when decoupled
from late-times physics could be in agreement with a higher value of $H_0$. {We also find no evidence
for the early dark energy model using only the early universe physics within the CMB data. Finally
using the BAO data in different redshift ranges to perform inverse distance ladder analysis, we
find that the early universe modifications, while being perfectly capable of alleviating the $H_0$-tension
when including the BAO galaxy clustering data, would be at odds with the Ly-$\alpha$ BAO data due
to the difference in $r_{\rm d}\, vs.\, H_0$ correlation between the two BAO datasets.} We therefore
infer and speculate that source for the $H_0$-tension between CMB and local estimates could possibly
originate in the modeling of late-time physics within the CMB analysis. This in turn recasts the
$H_0$-tension as an effect of late-time physics in CMB, instead of the current early-time CMB vs.
local late-time physics perspective.

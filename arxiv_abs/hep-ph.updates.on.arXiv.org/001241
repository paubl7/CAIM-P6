The origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry apparently obligates the laws of physics to include
some mechanism of baryon number ($\mathcal{B}$) violation. Searches for interactions violating
$\mathcal{B}$ and baryon-minus-lepton number $\mathcal{(B-L)}$ represent a rich and underutilized
opportunity. These are complementary to the existing, broad program of searches for $\mathcal{L}$-violating
modes such as neutrinoless double $\beta$-decay which could provide deeper understandings of
the plausibility of leptogenesis, or $\mathcal{B}$-violating, $\mathcal{(B-L)}$-conserving
processes such as proton decay. In particular, a low-scale, post-sphaleron violation mechanism
of $\mathcal{(B-L)}$ could provide a \textit{testable} form of baryogenesis. Though theoretically
compelling, searches for such $\mathcal{(B-L)}$-violating processes like $\Delta\mathcal{B}=2$
dinucleon decay and $n\rightarrow\bar{n}$ remain relatively underexplored experimentally
compared to other rare processes. By taking advantage of upcoming facilities such as the Deep Underground
Neutrino Experiment and the European Spallation Source, this gap can be addressed with new intranuclear
and free searches for neutron transformations with very high sensitivity, perhaps greater than
three orders of magnitude higher than previous experimental searches. This proceedings reports
on recent theoretical and experimental advances and sensitivities of next-generation searches
for neutron transformations were detailed as part of the Amherst Center for Fundamental Interactions
Workshop, "Theoretical Innovations for Future Experiments Regarding Baryon Number Violation,"
directly coordinated with the Rare Processes and Precision Measurements Frontier.

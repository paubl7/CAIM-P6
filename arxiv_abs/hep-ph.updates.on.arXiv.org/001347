Light front wave functions motivated by holographic constructions are used to study Bloom-Gilman
duality of deep inelastic scattering. Separate expressions for structure functions in terms of
quark and hadronic degrees of freedom are presented, with a goal of relating the two expressions.
A two-parton model is defined and resonance transition form factors are computed using previously
derived light front wave functions. A new form of global duality is derived from the valence quark-number
sum rule. Using a complete set of hadronic states is necessary for this new global duality to be achieved.
Previous original work does not provide such a set. This is remedied by amending the model to include
a longitudinal confining potential, and the resulting complete set is sufficient to carry out the
study of Bloom-Gilman duality. Expressions for transition form factors are obtained and all are
shown to fall asymptotically as 1/Q2. The Feynman mechanism dominates the asymptotic behavior
of the model. These transition form factors are used to assess the validity of the global and local
duality sum rules, with the result that both neither are satisfied. Evaluations of the hadronic
expression for q(x,Q2) provide more details about this lack. This result shows that the observed
validity of both global and local forms of duality for deep inelastic scattering must be related
to a feature of QCD that is deeper than completeness. Our simple present model suggests a prediction
that Bloom-Gilman duality would not be observed if deep inelastic scattering experiments were
to be made on the pion. The underlying origin of the duality phenomenon in deep inelastic scattering
is deeply buried within the confinement aspects of QCD, and remains a mystery.

We study static and spherically symmetric charged stars with a nontrivial profile of the scalar
field $\phi$ in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories. The scalar field is coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge
field $A_{\mu}$ with the form $-\alpha(\phi)F_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \nu}/4$, where $F_{\mu \nu}=\partial_{\mu}A_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}
A_{\mu}$ is the field strength tensor. Analogous to the case of charged black holes, we show that
this type of interaction can induce spontaneous scalarization of charged stars under the conditions
$({\rm d}\alpha/{\rm d}\phi) (0)=0$ and $({\rm d}^2\alpha/{\rm d}\phi^2) (0)>0$. For the coupling
$\alpha (\phi)=\exp (-\beta \phi^2/M_{\rm pl}^2)$, where $\beta~(<0)$ is a coupling constant
and $M_{\rm pl}$ is a reduced Planck mass, there is a branch of charged star solutions with a nontrivial
profile of $\phi$ approaching $0$ toward spatial infinity, besides a branch of general relativistic
solutions with a vanishing scalar field, i.e., solutions in the Einstein-Maxwell model. As the
ratio $\rho_c/\rho_m$ between charge density $\rho_c$ and matter density $\rho_m$ increases
toward its maximum value, the mass $M$ of charged stars in general relativity tends to be enhanced
due to the increase of repulsive Coulomb force against gravity. In this regime, the appearance of
nontrivial branches induced by negative $\beta$ of order $-1$ effectively reduces the Coulomb
force for a wide range of central matter densities, leading to charged stars with smaller masses
and radii in comparison to those in the general relativistic branch. Our analysis indicates that
spontaneous scalarization of stars can be induced not only by the coupling to curvature invariants
but also by the scalar-gauge coupling in Einstein gravity.

This thesis work focuses on studying the possible existence of phase transitions in the immediate
compact remnants of core collapse supernova, neutron stars, and the theoretical models that describe
the interior of dense matter. Specifically, we are interested in analyzing the feasibility of a
transition from hadronic matter to quark matter in the cores of these objects. For the phase transition
we will use two different formalisms: the Maxwell formalism or abrupt phase transition and the Gibbs
formalisms or mixed phase transition. For the description of hadronic matter, we will use different
parametrizations of the relativistic mean field model with density-dependent coupling constants.
For the description of quark matter we will use an effective nonlocal Nambu Jona-Lasinio model of
three flavors with vector interactions, in which we will include the possibility of formation of
diquarks to model a superconducting phase of color in $SU(3)$. Phase diagrams and equations of state
of quark matter at finite temperature are presented, and the influence of that type of matter on observables
associated with neutron stars is investigated. The simplified thermal evolution of compact stars
during their formation is studied, from their state of proto-neutron stars to that of cold neutron
stars, and the results obtained are compared with recent astrophysical observations. The results
obtained indicate that the occurrence of quark matter in the nuclei of these stars remains a promising
possibility. The fact that the use of more realistic models for the description of the dense matter
in these objects indicates the presence of quark matter inside neutron stars, could be an answer
to the question of the behavior of that kind of matter and the determination of its corresponding
equation of state.

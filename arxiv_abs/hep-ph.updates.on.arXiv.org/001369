We present an updated global fit of neutrino oscillation data in the simplest three-neutrino framework.
In the present study we include up-to-date analyses from a number of experiments. Concerning the
atmospheric and solar sectors, we give updated analyses of DeepCore and SNO data, respectively.
We have also included the latest electron antineutrino data collected by the Daya Bay and RENO reactor
experiments, and the long-baseline T2K and NO$\nu$A measurements. These new analyses result in
more accurate measurements of $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{12}$, $\Delta m_{21}^2$ and $|\Delta
m_{31}^2|$. The best fit value for the atmospheric angle $\theta_{23}$ lies in the second octant,
but first octant solutions remain allowed at $\sim2.4\sigma$. Regarding CP violation measurements,
the preferred value of $\delta$ we obtain is 1.08$\pi$ (1.58$\pi$) for normal (inverted) neutrino
mass ordering. The global analysis prefers normal neutrino mass ordering with 2.5$\sigma$. This
preference is milder than the one found in previous global analyses. The new results should be regarded
as robust due to the agreement found between our Bayesian and frequentist approaches. Taking into
account only oscillation data, there is a weak/moderate preference for the normal neutrino mass
ordering of $2.00\sigma$. While adding neutrinoless double beta decay from the latest Gerda, CUORE
and KamLAND-Zen results barely modifies this picture, cosmological measurements raise the preference
to $2.68\sigma$ within a conservative approach. A more aggressive data set combination of cosmological
observations leads to a similar preference, namely $2.70\sigma$. This very same cosmological
data set provides $2\sigma$ upper limits on the total neutrino mass corresponding to $\sum\nu<0.12$
($0.15$)~eV for normal (inverted) neutrino mass ordering.

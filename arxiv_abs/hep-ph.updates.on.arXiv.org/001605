Theoretical models and experimental observations suggest that gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and high-energy
neutrino bursts travelling through the interstellar space may reach the Earth at different speeds.
We propose and study in details the mechanism i), which always exists, where GRB are slowed down due
to the dispersion of light in the interstellar medium. In addition to the standard media such as electrons
and photons as CMB, we consider the medium with invisible axions. The amount of GRB delays in different
media are calculated in details utilizing a novel technique in QFT by using the hitherto known or
estimated densities of particles in the space without introducing any arbitrary parameter. Previously,
the GRB delays have been interpreted as a sign of Lorentz invariance violation by modifying the dispersion
relation of Special Relativity, which relates the energy, the momentum and the mass of a particle,
based on different mechanisms ii), such as a stringy spacetime foam, coming from a quantum gravity
effect and using an adjustable parameter. Obviously, all the above-mentioned mechanisms i) and
ii) are induced Lorentz invariance violations but not an intrinsic one. The amount of GRB delay due
to the two aforementioned interpretations can be distinguished by observing the time of arrival
of light with different frequencies. Namely, dispersion of light i) predicts that the higher energy
GRB arrive the Earth earlier, while in the other interpretations ii), they arrive later. We notice
that the needed amount for delay due to the dispersion of light shall have the potential power to shed
additional light on the microstructure of interstellar media with respect to the densities of constituent
particles and the origins of their sources. Finally, we indicate the ways to detect the intrinsic
Lorentz invariance violation and to interpret them theoretically.

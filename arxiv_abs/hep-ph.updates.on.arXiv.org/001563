We present a successful realization of sneutrino tribrid inflation model based on a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$
extension of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). A single interaction term involving
the $B-L$ Higgs field and the right-handed neutrinos serves multiple purposes. These include the
generation of heavy Majorana masses for the right-handed neutrinos to provide an explanation for
the tiny neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism, a realistic scenario for reheating and non-thermal
leptogenesis with a reheat temperature as low as $10^6$ GeV, and a successful realization of inflation
with right-handed sneutrino as the inflaton. The matter parity which helps avoid rapid proton decay
survives as a $Z_{2}$ subgroup of a $U(1)$ $R$-symmetry. Depending on the choice of model parameters
yields the following predicted range of the tensor to scalar ratio, $3 \times 10^{-11}\lesssim
r\lesssim 7\times 10^{-4}$ ($ 6 \times 10^{-7} \lesssim r \lesssim 0.01 $), and the running of the
scalar spectral index, $-0.00022 \lesssim dn_s/d\ln k \lesssim -0.0026$ ($-0.00014 \lesssim
dn_s/d\ln k \lesssim 0.005$), along with the $B-L$ breaking scale, $ 3 \times 10^{14}\lesssim M/
\text{GeV}\lesssim 5 \times 10^{15}$ ($ 6 \times 10^{15}\lesssim M/ \text{GeV}\lesssim 2 \times
10^{16}$), calculated at the central value of the scalar spectral index, $n_s =0.966$, reported
by Planck 2018. The possibility of realizing metastable cosmic strings in a grand unified theory
setup is briefly discussed. The metastable cosmic string network admits string tension values
in the range $10^{-8} \lesssim G\mu_s \lesssim 10^{-6}$, and predicts a stochastic gravitational
wave background lying within the 2-$\sigma$ bounds of the recent NANOGrav 12.5-yr data.

We present a detailed study of the interactions among scalar and pseudoscalar mesons and glueballs
within the framework of the generalized linear sigma model in the SU(3) flavor limit. The basis of
our approach is to develop a global understanding of light scalar and pseudoscalar mesons (up to
around 2 GeV) and thereby explore the underlying mixings among composite quark matter fields and
glueballs. The chiral sector of the Lagrangian is formulated in terms of two chiral nonets representing
quark-antiquarks and tetraquarks (in the leading order, this sector contains terms with eight
or fewer number of quak or antiquark lines). The Lagrangian also contains a sector that represents
scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs and their interactions with the matter chiral fields, in a manner
that the axial and trace anomalies of QCD are exactly realized. In this construct, the model has two
scalar octets and two pdeudoscalar octets (each a linear combination of two- and four-quark components),
as well as three scalar SU(3) singlets and three pseudoscalar SU(3) singlets (each a linear combination
of two- and four-quark components as well as a glueball component). With the inputs of the experimental
masses of $a_0(980)$, $a_0(1450)$, and the masses of $\pi(137)$, $\pi(1300)$ and their decay constants,
we perform an extensive numerical simulation to determine the boundaries of the parameter space
of the model. We further incorporate experimental data on the mass spectrum of eta states as well
as on several decay widths and decay ratios of $f_0$ states to zoom in on the parameter space and make
predictions for the substructure of pseudoscalar and scalar SU(3) octets and singlets as well as
for the pseudoscalar and scalar glueball masses. We find the scalar and pseudoscalar glueball masses
around 1.6 and 2.0 GeV, respectively.

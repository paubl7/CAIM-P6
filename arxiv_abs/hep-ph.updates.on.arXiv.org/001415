With updated experimental data and improved theoretical calculations, several significant deviations
are observed between the Standard Model predictions and the experimental measurements of the branching
ratios of $\bar{B}_{(s)}^0\to D_{(s)}^{(*)+} L^-$ decays, where $L$ is a light meson from the set
$\{\pi,\rho,K^{(\ast)}\}$. Especially for the two channels $\bar{B}^0\to D^{+}K^-$ and $\bar{B}_{s}^0\to
D_{s}^{+}\pi^-$, which are free of the weak annihilation contribution, the deviation can even
reach 4-5$\sigma$. Here we exploit possible new-physics effects in these class-I non-leptonic
$B$-meson decays within the framework of QCD factorization. Firstly, we perform a model-independent
analysis of the effects from twenty linearly independent four-quark operators that can contribute,
either directly or through operator mixing, to the quark-level $b\to c\bar u d(s)$ transitions.
Under the combined constraints from the current experimental data, we find that the observed deviations
could be well explained at the $2\sigma$ level by the new-physics four-quark operators with $\gamma^{\mu}(1-\gamma_5)\otimes\gamma_{\mu}
(1-\gamma_5)$, $(1+\gamma_5)\otimes(1-\gamma_5)$ and $(1+\gamma_5)\otimes(1+\gamma_5)$
structures, while the ones with other Dirac structures fail to provide a consistent interpretation.
Then, as two examples of model-dependent considerations, we discuss the case where the new-physics
four-quark operators are generated by either a colorless charged gauge boson or a colorless charged
scalar, with their masses fixed both at $1$ TeV. Constraints on the effective coefficients describing
the couplings of these mediators to the relevant quarks are obtained by fitting to the current experimental
data.

One possible progenitor of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is thought to be from a double neutron star
(NS) merger, and the remnant of such a merger may be a supramassive NS, which is supported by rigid
rotation and through its survival of hundreds of seconds before collapsing into a black hole (BH).
If this is the case, an optical/infrared transient (namely merger-nova) is generated from the ejected
materials and it is powered by radioactive decay from $r$-process, spin-down energy from a supramassive
NS, as well as the magnetic wind from a newborn BH. In this paper, we systematically search for the
signature of a supramassive NS central engine by analyzing the X-ray emission of short GRBs with
internal plateau observed by {\em Swift}, and we find that five candidates of short GRBs have such
feature with redshift measurement. Then, we calculate the possible merger-nova emission from
those candidates for given the typical model parameters by considering the above three energy sources,
and compare its brightness with the sensitivity of some optical telescopes. We find that the merger-nova
emission of GRB 060801 in K-, r-, and U-bands with variations of $M_{\rm ej}$ ($10^{-4}-10^{-2}
M_{\odot}$), $\kappa$ ($0.1-10 ~\rm cm^{2}~g^{-1}$), and $\beta$ ($0.1-0.3$) is very difficult
to detect using the Vera C. Rubin, Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS),
the Zwicky Transient Facility, and the Roman Space Telescope (Roman), except for the case of large
ejecta mass $M_{\rm ej}=10^{-2} M_{\odot}$. However, we are very hopeful to detect the merger-nova
emission of GRBs 090515, 100625A, and 101219A using more sensitive instruments, such as Vera C.
Rubin, Pan-STARRS, and Roman. Moreover, the merger-nova emission of GRB 160821B is bright enough
to detect in our calculations, and it is also consistent with current real observations of merger-nova
emission.

A unified treatment of both chiral and radiative corrections to the low-energy elastic lepton-proton
scattering processes is presented in Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbations Theory. The proton hadronic
chiral corrections include the next-to-next-to leading order corrections whereas the radiative
corrections include the next-to-leading order terms in our novel power counting scheme. We find
that the net fractional well-defined chiral corrections with respect to the leading order Born
cross section can be as large as $10\%$ ($20\%$) for electron (muon) scattering process for MUon
proton Scattering Experiment (MUSE) kinematics. We show {\it via} our model-independent treatment
of the low-energy lepton-proton kinematics, that the largest theoretical uncertainty is due to
the recent different published values of the proton's rms radius while, e.g., the next higher order
hadronic chiral terms are expected to give rather nominal errors. For the radiative corrections
we demonstrate a systematic order by order cancellation of all infrared singularities and present
our finite ultraviolet regularization results. We find that the radiative corrections for muon-proton
scattering is of the order of $2\%$, whereas for electron scattering the radiative corrections
could be as large as $25\%$. We attribute such a contrasting result partially to the fact that in muon
scattering the leading radiative order correction goes through zero in some intermediate low-momentum
transfer region, leaving the sub-leading radiative chiral order effects to play a dominant role
in this particular kinematic region. For the low-energy MUSE experiment, the often neglected lepton
mass as well as the Pauli form factor contributions of the relativistic leptons are incorporated
in all our computations.

The recent announcement of the observation of a new pentaquark peak by the LHCb collaboration, the
$P_{cs}(4459)$, adds a new member to the pentaquark family previously composed by the $P_c(4312)$,
$P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$. The $P_{cs}(4459)$ pentaquark is expected to have the light-quark
content of a $\Lambda$ baryon ($I=0$, $S=-1$), but its spin is unknown. It happens to be close to the
$\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$ threshold, which is at $4478\,{\rm MeV}$ in the isospin-symmetric limit. From
this, the possibility that the $P_{cs}$ is a molecular state composed of the aforementioned hadrons
readily comes to mind. Here we explore how the new pentaquark relates to the well-known pentaquark
trio: from flavor and heavy-quark symmetries we deduce the existence of nearby $\bar{D} \Xi_c'$
and $\bar{D} \Xi_c^*$ pentaquarks, which we might call $P_{cs}'(4437)$ and $P_{cs}^*(4504)$
in reference to their expected masses and charmed baryon contents. However if we want to further
pinpoint the possible mass of a $P_{cs}(4459)$ molecular pentaquark, we will have to resort to phenomenological
input. In particular from the hypothesis that the contact-range couplings of an effective field
theory describing the $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$, $\bar{D} \Xi_c'$ and $\bar{D} \Xi_c^*$ molecules are
effectively saturated by light-meson exchanges ($\sigma$, $\rho$ and $\omega$), we can predict
the existence of $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$ pentaquarks. If we assume the spin of a molecular $P_{cs}(4459)$
pentaquark to be $J = \tfrac{1}{2}$, we will predict its mass to be about $4469\,{\rm MeV}$. Conversely,
if we assume a $J=\tfrac{3}{2}$ pentaquark, its mass will be predicted within the $4453-4463\,{\rm
MeV}$ range. There is a preference the $P_{cs}$ pentaquark to have $J^P = \tfrac{3}{2}^-$, though
this relies on phenomenological assumptions and $J^P = \tfrac{1}{2}^-$ cannot be discarded.

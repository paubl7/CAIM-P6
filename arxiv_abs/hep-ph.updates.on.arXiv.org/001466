In addition to spectacular signatures such as black hole superradiance and the rotation of CMB polarization,
the plenitude of axions appearing in the string axiverse may have potentially dangerous implications.
An example is the cosmological overproduction of relic axions and moduli by the misalignment mechanism,
more pronounced in regions where the signals mentioned above may be observable, that is for large
axion decay constant. In this work, we study the minimal requirements to soften this problem and
show that the fundamental requirement is a long period of low-scale inflation. However, in this
case, if the inflationary Hubble scale is lower than around $O(100)$ eV, no relic DM axion is produced
in the early Universe. Cosmological production of some axions may be activated, via the misalignment
mechanism, if their potential minimum changes between inflation and today. As a particular example,
we study in detail how the maximal-misalignment mechanism dilutes the effect of dangerous axions
and allows the production of axion DM in a controlled way. In this case, the potential of the axion
that realises the mechanism shifts by a factor $\Delta\theta=\pi$ between the inflationary epoch
and today, and the axion starts to oscillate from the top of its potential. We also show that axions
with masses $m_a\sim O(1-100)\, H_0$ realising the maximal-misalignment mechanism generically
behave as dark energy with a decay constant that can take values well below the Planck scale, avoiding
problems associated to super-Planckian scales. Finally, we briefly study the basic phenomenological
implications of the mechanism and comment on the compatibility of this type of maximally-misaligned
quintessence with the swampland criteria.

Experimental measurements collected by the BABAR, Belle, and LHCb experiments on different observables
associated with the semileptonic transition $b \to c \tau \bar{\nu}_\tau$, indicate the existence
of disagreement respect with the Standard Model predictions. We analyse the charged scalar boson
contributions to these charged-current $B$ meson anomalies within the framework of two Higgs doublet
model with the most general Yukawa couplings to quarks and leptons from the third generation, involving
left-handed and right-handed (sterile) neutrinos. We perform a phenomenological study of the
Yukawa couplings parameter space that accommodates these anomalies. We consider the most recent
data from HFLAV world-average and Belle combination, and the upper limits ${\rm BR}(B_c^- \to \tau^-
\bar{\nu}_{\tau}) < 30\%$ and $10\%$. In addition, we include in our study the prospect measurements
on $R(D^{(\ast)})$ that the Belle II experiment could achieve and explore, for the first time, the
future implications for the corresponding charged scalar Yukawa couplings. This analysis updates
the existing literature and includes new important observables. Our results show that current
experimental $b\rightarrow c \tau \bar{\nu}_\tau$ data and Belle II projection favor the interpretation
of a charged scalar boson interacting with right-handed neutrinos. Furthermore, as a side analysis
regarding the charged scalar boson interpretation, we revisit the relation between $R(D^\ast)$
and ${\rm BR}(B_c^- \to \tau^- \bar{\nu}_{\tau})$ by investigating whether the claim that pseudoscalar
new physics interpretations of $R(D^{\ast})$ are implausible due to the $B_c$ lifetime is still
valid, to the light of the recent data and Belle II prospects on $R(D^{\ast})$. Lastly, we reexamine
addressing the $R(D^{(\ast)})$ anomalies in the context of the 2HDM of Type II.

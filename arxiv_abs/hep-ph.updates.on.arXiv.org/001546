Using the density matrix equations (DME) for high scale leptogenesis based on the type I seesaw mechanism,
in which the CP violation (CPV) is provided by the low-energy Dirac or/and Majorana phases of the
neutrino mixing (PMNS) matrix, we investigate the 1-to-2 and the 2-to-3 flavour regime transitions,
where the 1, 2 and 3 leptogenesis flavour regimes in the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the
Universe $\eta_B$ are described by the Boltzmann equations. Concentrating on the 1-to-2 flavour
transition we determine the general conditions under which $\eta_B$ goes through zero and changes
sign in the transition. Analysing in detail the behaviour of $\eta_B$ in the transition in the case
of two heavy Majorana neutrinos $N_{1,2}$ with hierarchical masses, $M_1 \ll M_2$, we find, in particular,
that i) the Boltzmann equations in many cases fail to describe correctly the generation of $\eta_B$
in the 1, 2 and 3 flavour regimes, ii) the 2-flavour regime can persist above (below) $\sim 10^{12}$
GeV ($\sim 10^9$ GeV), iii) the flavour effects in leptogenesis persist beyond the typically considered
maximal for these effects leptogenesis scale of $10^{12}$ GeV. We further determine the minimal
scale $M_{1\text{min}}$ at which we can have successful leptogenesis when the CPV is provided only
by the Dirac or Majorana phases of the PMNS matrix as well as the ranges of scales and values of the phases
for having successful leptogenesis. We show, in particular, that when the CPV is due to the Dirac
phase $\delta$, there is a direct relation between the sign of $\sin \delta$ and the sign of $\eta_B$
in the regions of viable leptogenesis in the case of normal hierarchical light neutrino mass spectrum;
for the inverted hierarchical spectrum the same result holds for $M_1 \lesssim 10^{13}$ GeV. The
considered scenarios of leptogenesis are testable and falsifiable in low-energy neutrino experiments.

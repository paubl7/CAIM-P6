Several measures of quantum correlations such as Leggett-Garg and Bell-type inequalities have
been extensively studied in the context of neutrino oscillations. However these analyses are performed
under the assumption of standard model (SM) interactions of neutrinos. In this work we study new
physics effects on $l_1$-norm based measure of quantum coherence which quantifies the quantumness
embedded in the system and is also intrinsically related to various measures of quantum correlations.
Moreover, it is considered to be a resource theoretical tool which can be utilized in quantum algorithms
and quantum channel discrimination. The new physics effects are incorporated in a model independent
way by using the effective Lagrangian for the neutral current non-standard neutrino interactions
(NSI). Bounds on the NSI parameters are extracted from a recent global analysis of oscillation experiments
including COHERENT (coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering experiment) data. In the context of
upcoming DUNE experimental setup, we find that the most favourable combination of LMA-Light sector
of $\theta_{12}$ (i.e., $\theta_{12}< 45^o$) with normal mass ordering decreases the coherence
in the system in comparison to the SM prediction for all values of neutrino energy E and CP violating
phase $\delta$ (except in the narrow region around E ~ 2 GeV). On the other hand, a large enhancement
in the value of coherence parameter in the entire $(E-\delta)$ plane is possible for the dark octant
of $\theta_{12}$ ($\theta_{12}> 45^o$) with inverted ordering. For almost all values of CP violating
phase, the enhancement is more protuberant in the region around E ~ 4 GeV where maximum neutrino flux
is expected in the DUNE experiment. Therefore for the normal mass ordering, the SM interaction provides
favourable conditions for quantum information tasks while the NSI favours inverted ordering scenario
for such tasks.

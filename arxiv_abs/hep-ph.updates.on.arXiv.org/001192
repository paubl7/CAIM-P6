We study quarkonium transport in the quark-gluon plasma by using the potential nonrelativistic
QCD (pNRQCD) effective field theory and the framework of open quantum systems. We argue that the
coupling between quarkonium and the thermal bath is weak using separation of scales. In the weak
coupling limit, the initial total system density matrix factorizes and the time evolution of the
subsystem is Markovian. We derive the semiclassical Boltzmann equation for quarkonium by applying
a Wigner transform to the Lindblad equation, working in the weak coupling limit and carrying out
a semiclassical expansion. The derivation is valid for both weakly-coupled and strongly coupled
quark-gluon plasmas. We find reaction rates in the transport equation factorize into a quarkonium
dipole transition function and a chromoelectric gluon distribution function. For the differential
reaction rate, the definition of the momentum dependent chromoelectric gluon distribution function
involves timelike Wilson lines. For the inclusive reaction rate, the Wilson line collapses into
a straight line along the real time axis and the distribution becomes momentum independent. The
structure of the Wilson line is analogous to that in the definitions of gluon parton distribution
function and Weizs\"acker-Williams type Sivers function. The centrality dependence of the quarkonium
nuclear modification factor measured by experiments probes the momentum independent distribution
while the transverse momentum dependence probes the momentum dependent one. We discuss one way
to indirectly constrain the quarkonium in-medium potential by using the factorization formula
and lattice calculations. The leading quantum correction to the semiclassical transport equation
of quarkonium is also worked out. The study can be easily generalized to quarkonium transport in
cold nuclear matter.

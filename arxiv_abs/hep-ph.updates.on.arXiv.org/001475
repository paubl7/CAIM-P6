This paper presents a full simulation study of the measurement of the production cross section ($\sigma_{\mathrm{ZH}}$)
of the Higgsstrahlung process $\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow ZH}$ and the Higgs boson mass ($M_{\mathrm{H}}$)
at the International Linear Collider (ILC), using events in which a Higgs boson recoils against
a Z boson decaying into a pair of muons or electrons. The analysis is carried out for three center-of-mass
energies $\sqrt{s}$ = 250, 350, and 500 GeV, and two beam polarizations $\mathrm{e_{L}^{-}e_{R}^{+}}$
and $\mathrm{e_{R}^{-}e_{L}^{+}}$, for which the polarizations of $\mathrm{e^{-}}$ and $\mathrm{e^{+}}$
are $\left(P\mathrm{e^{-}},P\mathrm{e^{+}}\right)$ =($-$80\%, +30\%) and (+80\%, $-$30\%),
respectively. Assuming an integrated luminosity of 250 $\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ for each beam polarization
at $\sqrt{s}$ = 250 GeV, where the best lepton momentum resolution is obtainable, $\sigma_{\mathrm{ZH}}$
and $M_{\mathrm{H}}$ can be determined with a precision of 2.5\% and 37 MeV for $\mathrm{e_{L}^{-}e_{R}^{+}}$
and 2.9\% and 41 MeV for $\mathrm{e_{R}^{-}e_{L}^{+}}$, respectively. Regarding a 20 year ILC
physics program, the expected precisions for the $\mathrm{HZZ}$ coupling and $M_{\mathrm{H}}$
are estimated to be 0.4\% and 14 MeV, respectively. The event selection is designed to optimize the
precisions of $\sigma_{\mathrm{ZH}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{H}}$ while minimizing the bias on the measured
$\sigma_{\mathrm{ZH}}$ due to discrepancy in signal efficiencies among Higgs decay modes. For
the first time, model independence has been demonstrated to a sub-percent level for the $\sigma_{\mathrm{ZH}}$
measurement at each of the three center-of-mass energies. The results presented show the impact
of center-of-mass energy and beam polarization on the evaluated precisons and serve as a benchmark
for the planning of the ILC run scenario.

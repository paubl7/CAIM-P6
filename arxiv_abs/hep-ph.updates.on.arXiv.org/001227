We use a diffusion Monte Carlo method to solve the many-body Schr\"odinger equation describing
fully-heavy tetraquark systems. This approach allows to reduce the uncertainty of the numerical
calculation at the percent level, accounts for multi-particle correlations in the physical observables,
and avoids the usual quark-clustering assumed in other theoretical techniques applied to the same
problem. The interaction between particles was modeled by the most general and accepted potential,
i.e. a pairwise interaction including Coulomb, linear-confining and hyperfine spin-spin terms.
This means that, in principle, our analysis should provide some rigorous statements about the mass
location of the all-heavy tetraquark ground states, which is particularly timely due to the very
recent observation made by the LHCb collaboration of some enhancements in the invariant mass spectra
of $J/\psi$-pairs. Our main results are: (i) the $cc\bar c\bar c$, $cc\bar b\bar b$ ($bb\bar c\bar
c$) and $bb\bar b \bar b$ lowest-lying states are located well above their corresponding meson-meson
thresholds; (ii) the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ $cc\bar c\bar c$ ground state with preferred quark-antiquark
pair configurations is compatible with the enhancement(s) observed by the LHCb collaboration;
(iii) our results for the $cc\bar c\bar b$ and $bb\bar c\bar b$ sectors seem to indicate that the $0^+$
and $1^+$ ground states are almost degenerate with the $2^+$ located around $100\,\text{MeV}$
above them; (iv) smaller mass splittings for the $cb\bar c\bar b$ system are predicted, with absolute
mass values in reasonable agreement with other theoretical works; (v) the $1^{++}$ $cb\bar c\bar
b$ tetraquark ground state lies at its lowest $S$-wave meson-meson threshold and it is compatible
with a molecular configuration.

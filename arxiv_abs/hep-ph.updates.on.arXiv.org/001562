We investigate unification prospects of two heavy scalar triplet extension of the standard model
where, in the absence of any right-handed neutrino (RHN), type-II seesaw accounts for current oscillation
data with hierarchical neutrino masses consistent with cosmological bounds and the lighter triplet
decay explains baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. We note that the absence of RHNs
in the fundamental fermion representations of SU(5) delineates its outstanding position compared
to SO(10) (or $E_6$). In addition, SU(5) needs smaller scalar representations ${15}_{H1}\oplus
{15}_{H2}$ compared to much larger representations ${126}_{H1}\oplus {126}_{H2} \subset $ SO(10)
(or ${351}^{\prime}_{H1}\oplus {351}^{\prime}_{H2} \subset E_6$). We show how precision gauge
coupling unification is achieved through SU(5) with the predictions of different sets of two heavy
triplet masses which, besides being compatible with type-II seesaw, are also consistent with unflavoured
or $\tau -$ flavoured leptogenesis. In addition to an intermediate mass colour octet fermion, completion
of precision gauge coupling unification is found to require essentially the presence of the well
known weak triplet fermion $\Sigma (3,0,1)$ in its mass range $M_{\Sigma}\simeq {\cal O}(500-3000)$
GeV out of which the dominant dark matter (DM) resonance mass $M_{\Sigma}\ge 2.4$ TeV is known to
account for the observed cosmological relic density. The deficiency in relic density for lighter
$\Sigma$ solutions is compensated by an additional scalar singlet DM. A GUT ansatz is noted to ensure
vacuum stability of the SM scalar potential for all types of unification solutions realised in this
work. We discuss proton lifetime estimations for $p\to e^+\pi^0$ compatible with the present Hyper-Kamiokande
bound as a function of an unknown mixing parameter in the model.

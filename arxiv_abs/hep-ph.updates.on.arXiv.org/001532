Scalar Field Dark Matter (SFDM) comprised of ultralight ($\gtrsim 10^{-22}$ eV) bosons is an alternative
to standard, collisionless Cold Dark Matter (CDM) that is CDM-like on large scales but inhibits
small-scale structure formation. As a Bose-Einstein condensate, its free-field ("fuzzy") limit
(FDM) suppresses structure below the de Broglie wavelength, $\lambda_\text{deB}$, creating
virialized haloes with central cores of radius $\sim\lambda_\text{deB}$, surrounded by CDM-like
envelopes, and a halo mass function (HMF) with a sharp cut-off on small scales. With a strong enough
repulsive self-interaction (SI), structure is inhibited, instead, below the Thomas-Fermi (TF)
radius, $R_\text{TF}$ (the size of an SI-pressure-supported ($n=1$)-polytrope), when $R_\text{TF}
> \lambda_\text{deB}$. Previously, we developed tools to describe SFDM dynamics on scales above
$\lambda_\text{deB}$ and showed that SFDM-TF haloes formed by Jeans-unstable collapse from non-cosmological
initial conditions have $R_\text{TF}$-sized cores, surrounded by CDM-like envelopes. Revisiting
SFDM-TF in the cosmological context, we simulate halo formation by cosmological infall and collapse,
and derive its transfer function from linear perturbation theory to produce cosmological initial
conditions and predict statistical measures of structure formation, such as the HMF. Since FDM
and SFDM-TF transfer functions both have small-scale cut-offs, we can align them to let observational
constraints on FDM proxy for SFDM-TF, finding FDM with particle masses $1 \lesssim m/(10^{-22}
\text{ eV}/c^2) \lesssim 30$ corresponds to SFDM-TF with $10 \gtrsim R_\text{TF}/(1 \text{ pc})
\gtrsim 1$, favoring sub-galactic (sub-kpc) core-size. The SFDM-TF HMF cuts off gradually, however,
leaving more small-mass haloes: its Jeans mass shrinks so fast, scales filtered early can still
recover and grow!

The QCD axion remains experimentally viable in the mass range of O(10 MeV) if (i) it couples predominantly
to the first generation of SM fermions; (ii) it decays to $e^+ e^-$ with a short lifetime $\tau_a\lesssim
4\times 10^{-14}\,$s; and (iii) it has suppressed isovector couplings, i.e., if it is piophobic.
Interestingly, these are precisely the properties required to explain recently observed anomalies
in nuclear de-excitations, to wit: the $e^+e^-$ emission spectra of isoscalar magnetic transitions
of $^{8\!}$Be and $^{4\!}$He nuclei showed a "bump-like" feature peaked at $m_{e^+e^-}\sim 17$
MeV. In this article, we argue that on-shell emission of the QCD axion (with the aforementioned properties)
provides an extremely well-motivated, compatible explanation for the observed excesses in these
nuclear de-excitations. The absence of anomalous features in other measured transitions is also
naturally explained: piophobic axion emission is strongly suppressed in isovector magnetic transitions,
and forbidden in electric transitions. This QCD axion hypothesis is further corroborated by an
independent observation: a $2-3\,\sigma$ deviation in the measurement of $\Gamma(\pi^0\to e^+e^-)$
from the SM theoretical expectation. This article also includes detailed estimations of various
axionic signatures in rare light meson decays, which take into account contributions from low-lying
QCD resonance exchange, and, in the case of rare Kaon decays, the possible effective implementations
of $\Delta S=1$ octet-enhancement in chiral perturbation theory. These inherent uncertainties
of the effective description of the strong interactions at low energies result in large variations
in the predictions for hadronic signals of the QCD axion; in spite of this, the estimated ranges for
rare meson decay rates obtained here can be probed in the near future in $\eta/\eta^\prime$ and Kaon
factories.

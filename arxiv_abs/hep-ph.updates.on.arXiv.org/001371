Transverse momentum spectra of $\pi^+$, $K^+$, $p$, $K^0_s$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$ or $\bar\Xi^+$
and $\Omega$ or $\bar\Omega^+$ or $\Omega+\bar\Omega$ in Copper-Copper (Cu-Cu), Gold-Gold (Au-Au)
and Lead-Lead (Pb-Pb) collisions at 200 GeV, 62.4 GeV and 2.76 TeV respectively, are analyzed in
different centrality bins by the blast wave model with Tsallis statistics. The model results are
approximately in agreement with the experimental data measured by BRAHMS, STAR and ALICE Collaborations
in special transverse momentum ranges. Kinetic freeze out temperature, transverse flow velocity
and kinetic freezeout volume are extracted from the transverse momentum spectra of the particles.
It is observed that $\bar\Xi^+$ and $\Omega$ or $\bar\Omega^+$ or $\Omega+\bar\Omega$ have larger
kinetic freezeout temperature followed by $K^+$, $K^0_s$ and $\Lambda$ than $\pi^+$ and $p$ due
to smaller reaction cross-sections of multi-strange and strange particles than non-strange particles.
The present work reveals the scenario of triple kinetic freezeout in collisions at BRAHMS, STAR
and ALICE Collaborations, however the transverse flow velocity and kinetic freezeout volume are
mass dependent and they decrease with the increasing rest mass of the particle. In addition, the
kinetic freezeout temperature, transverse flow velocity and kinetic freezeout volume are decreasing
from central to peripheral collisions while the parameter q increase from central to peripheral
collisions, indicating the approach of quick equilibrium in the central collisions. Besides,
the kinetic freezeout temperature and kinetic freezeout volume are observed to be larger in larger
collision system which shows its dependence on the size of the interacting system, while transverse
flow velocity increase with increasing energy.

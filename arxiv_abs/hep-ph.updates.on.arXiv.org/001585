We propose an alternative approach to L\"uscher's formula for extracting two-body scattering
phase shifts from finite volume spectra with no reliance on the partial wave expansion. We use an
effective-field-theory-based Hamiltonian method in the plane wave basis and decompose the corresponding
matrix elements of operators into irreducible representations of the relevant point groups. The
proposed approach allows one to benefit from the knowledge of the long-range interaction and avoids
complications from partial wave mixing in a finite volume. We consider spin-singlet channels in
the two-nucleon system and pion-pion scattering in the $\rho$-meson channel in the rest and moving
frames to illustrate the method for non-relativistic and relativistic systems, respectively.
For the two-nucleon system, the long-range interaction due to the one-pion exchange is found to
make the single-channel L\"uscher formula unreliable at the physical pion mass. For S-wave dominated
states, the L\"uscher method suffers from significant finite-volume artifacts for a $L=3$ fm box,
but it works well for boxes with $L>5$ fm. However, for P-wave dominated states, significant partial
wave mixing effects prevent the application of the single-channel L\"uscher formula regardless
of the box size (except for the near-threshold region). Using a toy model to generate synthetic data
for finite-volume energies, we show that our effective-field-theory-based approach in the plane
wave basis is capable of a reliable extraction of the phase shifts. For pion-pion scattering, we
employ a phenomenological model to fit lattice QCD results at the physical pion mass. The extracted
P-wave phase shifts are found to be in a good agreement with the experimental results.

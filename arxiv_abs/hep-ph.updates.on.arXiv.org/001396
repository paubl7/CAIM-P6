Dark stars are compact massive objects, described by Einstein gravitational field equations with
matter. The type we consider possesses no event horizon, instead, there is a deep gravitational
well with a very strong redshift factor. Observationally, dark stars can be identified with black
holes. Inside dark stars, Planck density of matter is reached, Planck cores are formed, where the
equations are modified by quantum gravity. In the paper, several models of dark stars with Planck
cores are considered, resulting in the following hypothesis on the composition of dark matter.
The galaxies are flooded with low-energetic radiation from the dark stars. The particle type can
be photons and gravitons from the Standard Model, can also be a new type of massless particles. The
model estimations show that the extremely large redshift factor $z\sim10^{49}$ and the emission
wavelength $\lambda_0\sim10^{14}$m can be reached. The particles are not registered directly
in the existing dark matter experiments. They come in a density sufficient to explain the observable
rotation curves. The emission has a geometric dependence of density on radius $\rho\sim r^{-2}$,
producing flat rotation curves. The distribution of sources also describes the deviations from
the flat shape. The model provides a good fit of experimental rotation curves. Outbreaks caused
by a fall of an external object on a dark star lead to emission wavelength shifted towards smaller
values. The model estimations give the outbreak wavelength $\lambda\sim1$m compatible with fast
radio bursts. The paper raises several principal questions. White holes with Planck core appear
to be stable. Galactic rotation curves in the considered setup do not depend on the matter type. Inside
the galaxy, dark matter can be of hot radial type. At cosmological distances, it can behave like the
cold uniform type.

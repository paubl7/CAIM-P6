We re-examine direct CP violation in the quasi-two-body $D\to V\!P$ decays and study CP asymmetries
in three-body $D$ decays proceeding through intermediate vector resonances within the framework
of the topological amplitude approach for tree amplitudes and the QCD factorization approach for
penguin amplitudes. As pointed out by us in 2012, the long-distance penguin-exchange amplitude
induced from final-state rescattering provides a major source of direct CP violation in both $D^0\to
K^+K^-$ and $D^0\to \pi^+\pi^-$. It nicely accounts for the CP asymmetry difference between the
aforementioned two modes observed by the LHCb in 2019. The same mechanism implies that CP asymmetry
can also occur at the per mille level in many of the $D\to V\!P$ channels. We point out six golden modes
which have sufficiently large branching fractions and direct CP violation of order $10^{-3}$.
In particular, the direct CP asymmetry difference $\Delta a_{CP}^{V\!P}$ between $D^0\to K^+K^{*-}$
and $D^0\to \pi^+\rho^-$ is predicted to be $(-1.61\pm0.33)\times 10^{-3}$, very similar to the
corresponding CP asymmetry difference observed in the $P\!P$ sector. In the absence of long-distance
QCD-penguin exchange contributions, $\Delta a_{CP}^{V\!P}$ will be negligibly small. We find
a positive and large CP asymmetry of order $10^{-3}$ in $D^0\to K_S\bar K^{*0}$, an example that
the asymmetry is induced at the tree level. It is thus desirable to search for CP violation also in
this mode. We take into account the flavor-singlet QCD-penguin contributions, which were missing
in our previous studies, to calculate their effects on the modes such as $D\to\pi\phi$ and $D\to
\eta \phi$. We compare our results with the other approach in detail. For three-body $D$ decays,
we perform the Dalitz plot analysis of those decays mediated by several vector resonances with the
same mass but different electric charges.

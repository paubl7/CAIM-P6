In this paper we propose a model within which the keeping of quarks inside a proton and the interaction
of these quarks with quarks of another hadron can be described simultaneously. The model of a three-particle
bispinor field is used for this purpose. Such a field, in comparison with the usual one-particle
field, is considered not on Minkowski space, but on a subset of the tensor product of three Minkowski
spaces, which is characterized by the equality of time coordinates of three events (subset of simultaneity).
Such a subset cannot be distinguished by the Lorentz invariant method. But due to the multiparticle
field transformation law in the transition from one inertial system to another one, the dynamic
equations for a three-particle field are consistent with the principle of relativity. The interaction
between quarks is introduced by requiring a local SUc(3) invariance. But in the paper a more general
way to achieve this invariance than the replacement in Lagrangian of ordinary derivatives by covariance
is proposed. The applied procedure leads to a two-index tensor of gauge field, both for Lorentz and
internal indices. The connection of this field with the bound states of gluons - glueballs is discussed.
It is shown that this glueball field can be represented as the sum of two terms: the classical field,
which plays the role of the potential energy of quark interaction in the proton, and the field corresponding
to quantum fluctuations around the classical field and describes the quark interaction in proton
with other hadrons. A dynamic equation is obtained for the field that determines the potential energy
of quark interaction. It is shown that this equation has solutions that correspond to the confinement
of quarks.

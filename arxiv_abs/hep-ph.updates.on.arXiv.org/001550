Standard lore ritualizes our quantum vacuum in the 4-dimensional spacetime (4d) governed by one
of the candidate Standard Models (SMs), while lifting towards one of Grand Unifications (GUTs)
at higher energy scales. In contrast, in our work, we introduce an alternative viewpoint that the
SM is a low energy quantum vacuum arising from various neighbor GUT vacua competition in an immense
quantum phase diagram. In general, we can regard the SM arising near the quantum criticality (either
critical points or critical regions) between the competing neighbor vacua. In particular detail,
we demonstrate how the $su(3)\times su(2)\times u(1)$ SM with 16n Weyl fermions arisen near the
quantum criticality between the competing neighbor vacua of Georgi-Glashow $su(5)$ model and
Pati-Salam $su(4) \times su(2) \times su(2)$ model. Moreover, to manifest a Beyond-the-Standard-Model
(BSM) quantum criticality between Georgi-Glashow and Pati-Salam models, we introduce a mother
effective field theory of a modified $so(10)$ GUT (with a Spin(10) gauge group) plus a new 4d discrete
torsion class of Wess-Zumino-Witten-like term that saturates a nonperturbative global mixed
gauge-gravity anomaly captured by a 5d invertible topological field theory $w_2w_3(TM)=w_2w_3(V_{\rm
SO(10)})$. If the internal symmetries were treated as global symmetries (or weakly coupled to probe
background fields), we show an analogous gapless 4d deconfined quantum criticality with new BSM
fractionalized fragmentary excitations of Color-Flavor separation, and gauge enhancement including
a Dark Gauge force sector. If the internal symmetries are dynamically gauged (as they are in our quantum
vacuum), we show the gauge-enhanced 4d criticality as a boundary criticality such that only appropriately
gauge enhanced dynamical GUT gauge fields can propagate into an extra-dimensional 5d bulk. The
phenomena may be regarded as a BSM "morphogenesis."

We studied the effect of a strong magnetic field ($B$) on the electrical conductivity of hot quark
matter. The electrical conductivity is a key transport coefficient determining the time dependence
and strength of magnetic fields generated in a relativistic heavy-ion collision. A~magnetic field
induces Hall anisotropic conduction, phase-space Landau-level quantization and, if sufficiently
strong, interferes with prominent QCD phenomena such as dynamical quark mass generation, likely
affecting the quark matter electrical conductivity, which depends strongly on the quark masses.
To address these issues, we used a quasi-particle description of quark matter in which the electric
charge carriers are constituent quarks with temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent masses
predicted by a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. The model accurately describes recent lattice QCD results
showing magnetic catalysis at low temperatures and inverse magnetic catalysis at temperatures
close to the pseudo-critical temperature ($T_{\rm pc}$) of the QCD phase transition. We found that
the magnetic field increases the conductivity component parallel to it and decreases the transverse
component, in qualitative agreement with recent lattice QCD results. In addition, we found that:
(1)~the space anisotropy of the conductivity increases with~$B$, (2)~the longitudinal conductivity
increases due to phase-space Landau-level quantization, (3)~a lowest Landau level approximation
behaves poorly for temperatures close to $T_{\rm pc}$, and (5)~inverse magnetic catalysis leaves
a distinctive signal in all components of the conductivity, a prominent peak at $T_{\rm pc}$. Our
study adds to the existing body of work on the hot quark matter electrical conductivity by incorporating
nontrivial temperature and magnetic field effects on dynamical mass generation.

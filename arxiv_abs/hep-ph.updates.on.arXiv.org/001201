We review the present knowledge for $\alpha_s$, the fundamental coupling underlying the interactions
of quarks and gluons in QCD. The dependence of $\alpha_s(Q^2)$ on momentum transfer $Q$ encodes
the underlying dynamics of hadron physics -from color confinement in the infrared domain to asymptotic
freedom at short distances. We review constraints on $\alpha_s(Q^2)$ at high $Q^2$, as predicted
by perturbative QCD, and its analytic behavior at small $Q^2$, based on models of nonperturbative
dynamics. In the introductory part of this review, we explain the phenomenological meaning of $\alpha_s$,
the reason for its running, and the challenges facing a complete understanding of its analytic behavior
in the infrared domain. In the second, more technical, part of the review, we discuss the behavior
of $\alpha_s(Q^2)$ in the high $Q^2$ domain of QCD. We review how $\alpha_s$ is defined, including
its renormalization scheme dependence, the definition of its renormalization scale, the utility
of effective charges, as well as Commensurate Scale Relations which connect the various definitions
of $\alpha_s$ without renormalization-scale ambiguity. We also report recent measurements and
theoretical analyses which have led to precise QCD predictions at high energy. In the last part of
the review, we discuss the challenge of understanding the analytic behavior $\alpha_s(Q^2)$ in
the infrared domain. We also review important methods for computing $\alpha_s$, including lattice
QCD, the Schwinger-Dyson equations, the Gribov-Zwanziger analysis and light-front holographic
QCD. After describing these approaches and enumerating their conflicting predictions, we discuss
the origin of these discrepancies and how to remedy them. Our aim is not only to review the advances
in this difficult area, but also to suggest what could be an optimal definition of $\alpha_s$ in order
to bring better unity to the subject.

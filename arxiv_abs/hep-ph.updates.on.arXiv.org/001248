A light boson $U$ from an extra $U(1)$ interpolates between a generalized dark photon coupled to
$Q,\ B$ and $L_i$ (or $B-L$), plus possibly dark matter, a dark $Z$ coupled to the $Z$ current, and
one axially coupled to quarks and leptons. We identify the corresponding $U(1)_F$ symmetries,
with $F= \gamma_Y Y+\gamma_B B+\gamma_{L_i}L_i+\gamma_A F_A+\gamma_{F'}F'\!+\gamma_d F_d$,
$F_d$ acting in a dark sector and $F'$ on possible semi-inert BEH doublets uncoupled to quarks and
leptons. The $U$ current is obtained from the $U(1)_F $ and $Z$ currents, with a mixing determined
by the spin-0 BEH fields. The charge $Q_U$ of chiral quarks and leptons is a combination of $Q,\ B,\
L_i$ and $T_{3L}$ with the axial $F_A$. It involves in general isovector and isoscalar axial terms,
in the presence of two BEH doublets. A longitudinal $U$ with axial couplings has enhanced interactions,
and behaves much as an axionlike particle. Its axial couplings $g_A$, usually restricted to $< 2\times
10^{-7} m_U$(MeV), lead to effective pseudoscalar ones $g_P= g_A\times 2m_{q,l}\,/m_U=2^{1/4}\,
G_F^{1/2}\, m_{q,l} \ A_\pm $. $\,A_\pm$ is proportional to an invisibility parameter $r=\cos\theta_A$
induced by a singlet v.e.v., possibly large and allowing the $U$ to be very weakly interacting. This
allows for a very small gauge coupling, expressed with two doublets and a singlet as $g"\!/4\simeq
2\times 10^{-6} m_U$(MeV) $ r/\sin 2\beta$. We discuss phenomenological implications for meson
decays, neutrino interactions, atomic-physics parity violation, naturally suppressed $\pi^0\to\gamma
U$ decays, etc.. The $U$ boson fits within the grand-unification framework, in symbiosis with a
$SU(4)_{\rm es }$ electrostrong symmetry broken at the GUT scale, with $Q_U$ depending on $Q,\ B-L,\
F_A$ and $T_{3A}$ through three parameters $\gamma_Y,\ \gamma_A$ and $\eta$.

There is a controversy of how to interpret interactions of electrons with a large spatial coherence
with light and matter. When such an electron emits a photon, it can do so either as if its charge were
confined to a point within a coherence length, the region where a square modulus of a wave function
$|\psi|^2$ is localized, or as a continuous cloud of space charge spread over it. This problem was
addressed in a recent study R.~Remez, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 123}, 060401 (2019) where a conclusion
was drawn in favor of the first (point) interpretation. Here we argue that there is an alternative
explanation for the measurements reported in that paper, which relies on purely classical arguments
and does not allow one to refute the second interpretation. We propose an experiment of Smith-Purcell
radiation from a non-relativistic vortex electron carrying orbital angular momentum, which can
unambiguously lead to the opposite conclusion. Beyond the paraxial approximation, the vortex
packet has a non-point electric quadrupole moment, which grows as the packet spreads and results
in a non-linear $L^3$-growth of the radiation intensity with the length $L$ of the grating when $L$
is much larger than the packet's Rayleigh length. Such a non-linear effect has never been observed
for single electrons and, if detected, it would be a hallmark of the non-point nature of charge in
a wave packet. Thus, two views on $|\psi|^2$ are complementary to each other and an electron radiates
either as a point charge or as a continuous charge flow depending on the experimental conditions
and on its quantum state. Our conclusions hold for a large class of non-Gaussian packets and emission
processes for which the radiation formation length can exceed the Rayleigh length, such as Cherenkov
radiation, transition radiation, diffraction radiation, and so forth.

In this paper, a model inspired by Grand Unification principles featuring three generations of
vector-like fermions, new Higgs doublets and a rich neutrino sector at the low scale is presented.
Using the state-of-the-art Deep Learning techniques we perform the first phenomenological analysis
of this model focusing on the study of new charged vector-like leptons (VLLs) and their possible
signatures at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In our numerical analysis we consider signal
events for vector-boson fusion and VLL pair production topologies, both involving a final state
containing a pair of charged leptons of different flavor and two sterile neutrinos that provide
a missing energy. We also consider the case of VLL single production where, in addition to a pair of
sterile neutrinos, the final state contains only one charged lepton. All calculated observables
are provided as data sets for Deep Learning analysis, where a neural network is constructed, based
on results obtained via an evolutive algorithm, whose objective is to maximise either the accuracy
metric or the Asimov significance for different masses of the VLL. Taking into account the effect
of the three analysed topologies, we have found that the combined significance for the observation
of new VLLs at the high-luminosity LHC can range from $5.7\sigma$, for a mass of $1.25~\mathrm{TeV}$,
all the way up to $28\sigma$ if the VLL mass is $200~\mathrm{GeV}$. We have also shown that by the end
of the LHC Run-III a $200~\mathrm{GeV}$ VLL can be excluded with a confidence of $8.8$ standard deviations.
The results obtained show that our model can be probed well before the end of the LHC operations and,
in particular, providing important phenomenological information to constrain the energy scale
at which new gauge symmetries emergent from the considered Grand Unification picture can be manifest.

We show that the Borel representations of tau hadronic spectral function moments based on contour-improved
perturbation theory (CIPT) in general differ from those in fixed-order perturbation theory (FOPT).
Both representations can be related to different regularization prescriptions of infrared renormalon
cuts in the inverse Borel transformation of the underlying Adler function. The Borel sums obtained
from both types of Borel representations in general differ and the apparently conflicting asymptotic
behavior of the FOPT and CIPT spectral function moment series, which has been subject to many studies
in the past literature, can be understood quantitatively from these results for concrete Borel
function models. The discrepancy between the CIPT and FOPT Borel sums, which we call the 'asymptotic
separation', can be computed analytically for any Borel model and is related to inverse exponential
terms in the strong coupling. For Borel function models containing a renormalon cut related to the
gluon condensate the size of the asymptotic separation is in general larger than that of the well-established
FOPT Borel sum ambiguity, but it can be modulated in a predictable way by choosing specific spectral
function moments. Even though moments can be designed for such models where the asymptotic difference
is smaller than the FOPT Borel sum ambiguity, the asymptotic separation is as a matter of principle
unavoidable. If the Borel function of the Adler function has a sizeable gluon condensate renormalon
cut, the asymptotic separation can explain the observed disparity of the CIPT and FOPT spectral
function moments at the 5-loop level. The existence of the asymptotic separation implies that the
power corrections in the operator product expansions for the spectral function moments in the CIPT
and the FOPT approach differ and that the hadron level description of both approaches may be reconciled.

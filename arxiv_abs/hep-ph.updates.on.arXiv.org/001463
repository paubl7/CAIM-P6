As distinct from the black hole physics, the de Sitter thermodynamics is not determined by the cosmological
horizon, the effective temperature differs from the Hawking temperature. In particular, the atom
in the de Sitter universe experiences thermal activation corresponding to the local temperature,
which is twice larger than the Hawking temperature, $T_{\rm loc}=2T_{\rm Hawking}$. The same double
Hawking temperature describes the decay of massive scalar field in the de Sitter universe. The reason,
why the local temperature is exactly twice the Hawking temperature, follows from the geometry of
the de Sitter spacetime. The weakening of the role of the cosmological horizon in de Sitter universe
is confirmed by considering Hawking radiation. We discuss the difference between the radiation
of particles in the de Sitter spacetime and the Schwinger pair creation in the electric field. We
use the stationary Painleve-Gullstrand metric for the de Sitter spacetime, where the particles
are created by Hawking radiation from the cosmological horizon, and time independent gauge for
the electric field. In these stationary frames the Hamiltonians and the energy spectra of massive
particles look rather similar. However, the final results are essentially different. In case of
Schwinger pair production the number density of the created pairs grows with time, while in the de
Sitter vacuum the number density of the created pairs is finite. The latter suggests that Hawking
radiation from the cosmological horizon does not lead to instability of the de Sitter vacuum. The
other mechanisms of instability are required for the dynamical solution of the cosmological constant
problem. We consider the possible role of the local temperature $T_{\rm loc}=2T_{\rm H}$ in the
decay of the de Sitter space-time due to the energy exchange between the vacuum energy and relativistic
matter with this temperature.

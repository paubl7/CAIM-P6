We investigate the possible presence of dark matter (DM) in massive and rotating neutron stars (NSs).
For the purpose we extend our previous work [1] to introduce a light new physics vector mediator besides
a scalar one in order to ensure feeble interaction between fermionic DM and $\beta$ stable hadronic
matter in NSs. The masses of DM fermion, the mediators and the couplings are chosen consistent with
the self-interaction constraint from Bullet cluster and from present day relic abundance. Assuming
that both the scalar and vector mediators contribute equally to the relic abundance, we compute
the equation of state (EoS) of the DM admixed NSs to find that the present consideration of the vector
new physics mediator do not bring any significant change to the EoS and static NS properties of DM
admixed NSs compared to the case where only the scalar mediator was considered [1]. However, the
obtained structural properties in static conditions are in good agreement with the various constraints
on them from massive pulsars like PSR J0348+0432 and PSR J0740+6620, the gravitational wave (GW170817)
data and the recently obtained results of NICER experiments for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620.
We also extended our work to compute the rotational properties of DM admixed NSs rotating at different
angular velocities. The present results in this regard suggest that the secondary component of
GW190814 may be a rapidly rotating massive DM admixed NS. The constraints on rotational frequency
from pulsars like PSR B1937+21 and PSR J1748-2446ad are also satisfied by our present results. Also,
the constraints on moment of inertia are satisfied considering slow rotation. The universality
relation in terms of normalized moment of inertia also holds good with our DM admixed EoS.

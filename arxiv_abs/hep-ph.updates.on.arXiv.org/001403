Non-analyticity in co-moving momenta within the non-Gaussian bispectrum is a distinctive sign
of on-shell particle production during inflation, presenting a unique opportunity for the "direct
detection" of particles with masses as large as the inflationary Hubble scale ($H$). However, the
strength of such non-analyticity ordinarily drops exponentially by a Boltzmann-like factor as
masses exceed $H$. In this paper, we study an exception provided by a dimension-5 derivative coupling
of the inflaton to heavy-particle currents, applying it specifically to the case of two real scalars.
The operator has a "chemical potential" form, which harnesses the large kinetic energy scale of
the inflaton, $\dot{\phi}_{0}^{1/2} \approx 60H$, to act as an efficient source of scalar particle
production. Derivative couplings of inflaton ensure radiative stability of the slow-roll potential,
which in turn maintains (approximate) scale-invariance of the inflationary correlations. We
show that a signal not suffering Boltzmann suppression can be obtained in the bispectrum with strength
$f_{\mathrm{NL}} \sim \mathcal{O}(0.01-10)$ for an extended range of scalar masses, $M \lesssim
\dot{\phi}_{0}^{1/2}$, potentially as high as $10^{15}$ GeV, within the sensitivity of upcoming
LSS and more futuristic 21-cm experiments. The mechanism does not invoke any particular fine-tuning
of parameters or breakdown of perturbation-theoretic control. The leading contribution appears
at tree-level, which makes the calculation analytically tractable and removes the loop-suppression
as compared to earlier chemical potential studies of non-zero spins. The steady particle production
allows us to infer the effective mass of the heavy particles and the chemical potential from the variation
in bispectrum oscillations as a function of co-moving momenta. Our analysis sets the stage for generalization
to heavy bosons with non-zero spin.

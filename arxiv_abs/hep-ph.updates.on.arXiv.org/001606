The energy measurement uncertainty of circular electron positron collider (CEPC) beam must be
less than $10 \mathrm{MeV}$ to accurately measure the mass of the Higgs/W/Z boson. A new microwave-beam
Compton backscattering method is proposed to measure the beam energy by detecting the maximum energy
of scattered photons. The uncertainty of the beam energy measurement is $6 \mathrm{MeV}$. The detection
accuracy of the maximum energy of scattered photons need to reach $10^{-4}$. The high-precision
gamma detectors can only be a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector. It is a semiconductor detector,
the effective detection range of the gamma energy is 100$\mathrm{keV}$-10$\mathrm{MeV}$. The
maximum energy of the scattered photons is chosen to be the higher the better to reduce the influence
of the synchrotron radiation background. Therefore, the maximum energy of the scattered photons
is selected to be 9$\mathrm{MeV}$. Therefore, the initial photons should be microwave photons
to collide with the electrons with the energy of 120GeV on CEPC. The cylindrical resonant cavity
with ${TM_{010}}$ mode is selected to transmit microwaves. After Compton backscattering, the
scattered photons emit from the vacuum tube of the synchrotron radiation and the energy is detected
by the HPGe detector. The structure of shielding materials with polyethylene and lead is designed
to minimize the background noise, such as the synchrotron radiation and the classical radiation
from the electron beam in the cavity. The hole radius in the side wall of the cavity is about $1.5\mathrm{mm}$
to allow the electron beam to pass through. The computer simulation technology (CST) software shows
that the influence of the hole radius on the cavity field is negligible, and the influence of the hole
radius on the resonance frequency can be corrected easily.

The molecular assignments to the three $P_c$ states and the similar production mechanism between
the $\Lambda_b\to P_c+K$ and $B\to XYZ+K$ convince us the $B$ decaying to a charmonium state plus
light mesons could be the appropriate production process to search for the charmonium-like molecular
tetraquarks. In this work, we systematically study the interactions between a charmed (charmed-strange)
meson and an anti-charmed (anti-charm-strange) meson, which include the $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$,
$\bar{D}^{(*)}\bar{D}_1$, $D^{(*)}\bar{D}_2^*$, $D_s^{(*)}\bar{D}_s^{(*)}$, ${D}_s^{(*)}\bar{D}_{s0}^*$,
$D_s^{(*)}\bar{D}_{s1}^{\prime}$, ${D}_s^{(*)}\bar{D}_{s1}$, $D_s^{(*)}\bar{D}_{s2}^*$
systems. After adopting the one-boson-exchange effective potentials, our numerical results
indicate that, on one hand, there can exist a serial of isoscalar charmonium-like $\mathcal{D}\bar{\mathcal{D}}$
and $\mathcal{D}_s\bar{\mathcal{D}}_s$ molecular states, on the other hand, we can fully exclude
the charged charmonium-like states as the isovector charmonium-like molecules. Meanwhile, we
discuss the two-body hidden-charm decay behaviors for these possible charmonium-like molecular
tetraquarks. By analyzing the experimental data collected from the $B\to XYZ+K$ and the mass spectrum
and strong decay behaviors for the obtained $\mathcal{D}\bar{\mathcal{D}}$ and $\mathcal{D}_s\bar{\mathcal{D}}_s$
molecules, we find possible hints of the existence of the charmonium-like molecular tetraquarks,
i.e., a peculiar characteristic mass spectrum of the isoscalar $D^*\bar{D}^*$ molecular systems
can be applied to identify the charmonium-like molecule. We look forward to the future experiments
like the LHCb, Belle II, and BESIII Collaborations can test our results with more precise experimental
data.

Recently, microquasar jets have aroused the interest of many researchers focusing on the astrophysical
plasma outflows and various jet ejections. In this work, we concentrate on the investigation of
electromagnetic radiation and particle emissions from the jets of stellar black hole binary systems
characterized by their hadronic content in their jets. Such emissions are reliably described within
the context of the relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics. Our model calculations are based on the
Fermi acceleration mechanism through which the primary particles (mainly protons) of the jet are
accelerated. As a result, a small portion of thermal protons of the jet acquire relativistic energies,
through shock-waves generated into the jet plasma. From the inelastic collisions of fast (non-thermal)
protons with the thermal (cold) ones, secondary charged and neutral particles (pions, kaons, muons,
$\eta$-particles, etc.) are created as well as electromagnetic radiation from the radio wavelength
band, to X-rays and even to very high energy $\gamma$-ray emission. One of our main goals is, through
the appropriate solution of the transport equation and taking into account the various mechanisms
that cause energy losses to the particles, to study the secondary particle distributions within
hadronic astrophysical jets. After testing our method on the Galactic MQs SS 433 and Cyg X-1, as a
concrete extragalactic binary system, we examine the LMC X-1 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud,
a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way Galaxy. It is worth mentioning that, for the companion O star (and
its extended nebula structure) of the LMC X-1 system, new observations using spectroscopic data
from VLT/UVES have been published few years ago.

Extensions of the Standard Model (SM) often contain new particles with masses far above the electroweak
scale. Due to the presence of a mass hierarchy, effective field theory (EFT) is a suitable tool for
the study of such extensions. In this thesis, we provide a solution to the matching problem at the
one-loop level in the form of the Bispinor Universal One-Loop Effective Action (BSUOLEA), which
is a pre-computed expression for the effective action, parameterised in terms of derivatives of
the Lagrangian of the ultraviolet (UV) model. The BSUOLEA is derived using functional methods and
is sufficiently general to match any renormalisable, Lorentz invariant UV model to an EFT, containing
operators of mass dimension up to and including six at the one-loop level. This includes supersymmetric
models regularised in dimensional reduction. Since the pre-computed expression contains many
operators, it is implemented into a currently private Mathematica package, which automatically
performs the matching based on the BSUOLEA. We illustrate the use of this package, which will be made
publicly available in the near future, by applying it to the matching of the Singlet Extended SM to
the SM EFT. We then expand the framework in order to apply it to a non-renormalisable extension of
the SM containing a vector resonance, which is assumed to arise from the confinement of a gauge group
at high energies. This model raises some interesting theoretical questions since such a vector
resonance comprises a system with second-class constraints. We perform the constraint analysis
of the model and derive the generating functional in order to apply functional methods to the matching.
We finally match the model to the SM EFT and present the full one-loop result including operators
up to mass dimension six.

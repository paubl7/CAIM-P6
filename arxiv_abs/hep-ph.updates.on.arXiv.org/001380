Dimensional reduction has proven to be a surprisingly powerful tool for delineating the boundary
between the string landscape and the swampland. Bounds from the Weak Gravity Conjecture and the
Repulsive Force Conjecture, for instance, are exactly preserved under dimensional reduction.
Motivated by its success in these cases, we apply a similar dimensional reduction analysis to bounds
on the gradient of the scalar field potential $V$ and the mass scale $m$ of a tower of light particles
in terms of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, which ideally may pin down ambiguous $O(1)$ constants
appearing in the de Sitter Conjecture and the (Anti) de Sitter Distance Conjecture, respectively.
We find that this analysis distinguishes the bounds $|\nabla V|/V \geq \sqrt{4/(d-2)}$, $m \lesssim
|\Lambda|^{1/2}$, and $m \lesssim |\Lambda|^{1/d}$ in $d$-dimensional Planck units. The first
of these bounds precludes accelerated expansion of the universe in Einstein-dilaton gravity and
is almost certainly violated in our universe, though it may apply in asymptotic limits of scalar
field space. The second bound cannot be satisfied in our universe, though it is saturated in supersymmetric
AdS vacua with well-understood uplifts to 10d/11d supergravity. The third bound likely has a limited
range of validity in quantum gravity as well, so it may or may not apply to our universe. However, if
it does apply, it suggests a possible relation between the cosmological constant and the neutrino
mass, which (by the see-saw mechanism) may further provide a relation between the cosmological
constant problem and the hierarchy problem. We also work out the conditions for eternal inflation
in general spacetime dimensions, and we comment on the behavior of these conditions under dimensional
reduction.

The compactification from the eleven-dimensional Ho\v{r}ava-Witten orbifold to five-dimensional
heterotic M-theory on a Schoen Calabi-Yau threefold is reviewed, as is the specific $SU(4)$ vector
bundle leading to the "heterotic standard model" in the observable sector. Within the context of
strongly coupled heterotic M-theory, a formalism for consistent hidden-sector bundles associated
with a single line bundle is presented, and a specific line bundle is introduced as a concrete example.
Anomaly cancellation and the associated bulk space five-branes are discussed in this context,
as is the constraint that the hidden sector bundle be compatible with the slope-stability requirements
of the observable sector $SU(4)$ gauge bundle. The further compactification to a four-dimensional
effective theory on a linearized BPS double domain wall is then presented to order $\kappa_{11}^{4/3}$.
Specifically, the generic constraints required for anomaly cancellation and the restrictions
imposed by positive squared gauge couplings to order $\kappa_{11}^{4/3}$ are presented in detail.
Three additional constraints are imposed, one guaranteeing that the $S^{1}/{\mathbb{Z}}_{2}$
orbifold length is sufficiently larger than the average Calabi-Yau radius, and two enforcing that
the hidden sector be compatible with both the unification mass scale and unified gauge coupling
of the $SO(10)$ group in the observable sector. Finally, the expression for the Fayet-Iliopoulos
term associated with an anomalous $U(1)$ symmetry is presented and its role in $N=1$ supersymmetry
in the low-energy effective theory is discussed. It is shown that $N=1$ supersymmetry can be preserved
by cancelling the tree-level and genus-one contributions against each another.

We propose a new model of Early Dark Energy (EDE) as a solution to the Hubble tension in cosmology,
the apparent discrepancy between local measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0\simeq 74$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ and $H_0\simeq 67$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ inferred from the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB). In Chain EDE, the Universe undergoes a series of first order phase transitions, starting
at a high energy vacuum in a potential, and tunneling down through a chain of every lower energy metastable
minima. As in all EDE models, the contribution of the vacuum energy to the total energy density of
the universe is initially negligible, but reaches $\sim 10\%$ around matter-radiation equality,
before cosmological data require it to redshift away quickly -- at least as fast as radiation. We
indeed obtain this required behavior with a series of $N$ tunneling events, and show that for $N>600$
the phase transitions are rapid enough to allow fast percolation and thereby avoid large scale anisotropies
in the CMB. We construct a specific example of Chain EDE featuring a scalar field in a quasiperiodic
potential (a tilted cosine), which is ubiquitous in axion physics and, therefore, carries strong
theoretical motivation. Interestingly, the energy difference between vacua can be roughly the
size of today's Dark Energy (meV scale). Therefore, the end result of Chain EDE could provide a natural
explanation of Dark Energy, if the tunneling becomes extremely slow in the final step before the
field reaches zero (or negative) energy. We discuss a simple mechanism which can stop the scalar
field in the desired minimum. Thus Chain EDE offers the exciting prospect to explain EDE and Dark
Energy by the same scalar field.

Heavy ion collisions provide a unique opportunity to study the nature of X(3872) compared with electron-positron
and proton-proton (antiproton) collisions. With the abundant charm pairs produced in heavy-ion
collisions, the production of multicharm hadrons and molecules can be enhanced by the combination
of charm and anticharm quarks in the medium. We investigate the centrality and momentum dependence
of X(3872) in heavy-ion collisions via the Langevin equation and instant coalescence model (LICM).
When X(3872) is treated as a compact tetraquark state, the tetraquarks are produced via the coalescence
of heavy and light quarks near the quantum chromodynamic (QCD) phase transition due to the restoration
of the heavy quark potential at $T\rightarrow T_c$. In the molecular scenario, loosely bound X(3872)
is produced via the coalescence of $D^0$-$\bar D^{*0}$ mesons in a hadronic medium after kinetic
freeze-out. The phase space distributions of the charm quarks and D mesons in a bulk medium are studied
with the Langevin equation, while the coalescence probability between constituent particles
is controlled by the Wigner function, which encodes the internal structure of the formed particle.
First, we employ the LICM to explain both $D^0$ and $J/\psi$ production as a benchmark. Then, we give
predictions regarding X(3872) production. We find that the total yield of tetraquark is several
times larger than the molecular production in Pb-Pb collisions. Although the geometric size of
the molecule is huge, the coalescence probability is small due to strict constraints on the relative
momentum between $D^0$ and $\bar D^{*0}$ in the molecular Wigner function, which significantly
suppresses the molecular yield.

In the effort to define the main features a successful solution to the Hubble tension should have,
growing evidence has emerged pointing to the need for models able to modify the expansion (and possibly
thermal) history of the universe both prior and after recombination, and that could thereby restore
the overall concordance between early- and late-time observations without introducing nor worsening
other cosmological tensions in the process. In precisely this spirit, here we consider a multi-interacting
dark energy model with two complementary interaction channels: one with the dark matter and one
with the photons. The former most significantly affects the matter dominated epoch as well as the
very late universe, and has been shown to be able to significantly resolve the $S_8$ tension. The
latter has been introduced in this work to allow for a larger and natural time dependence of the evolution
of the universe since it mostly impacts the radiation dominated epoch as well as the temperature
scaling of the photons, as extensively explained in the text. As a result, considering data from
Planck+BAO+Pantheon+KV450+DES (which can be combined since the $S_8$ value is lowered even neglecting
the weak lensing data) we find that the significance of the $H_0$ tension only reduces to about 3.5$\sigma$,
while that of the $S_8$ tension falls below the 2$\sigma$ level. Also, the statistical analysis
we perform strongly favors $\Lambda$CDM in all considered cases. Overall, we conclude that the
specific multi-interacting dark energy model considered here, despite its broad generality and
very rich cosmological phenomenology, cannot successfully restore the aforementioned overall
concordance between early- and late-time observations.

We calculate the low-lying glueball spectra, some string tensions and some properties of topology
and the running coupling for SU(N) lattice gauge theories in 3+1 dimensions, for N=2 to N=12, and
for glueball states in all the representations of the cubic rotation group, as well as P and C. We extrapolate
these results to the continuum limit of each theory and then to N=oo. For a number of these states we
are able to identify their continuum spins with very little ambiguity. We calculate the fundamental
string tension and k=2 string tension and investigate the N dependence of the ratio. Using the string
tension as the scale, we confirm that g(a)**2 varies as 1/N for constant physics at large N. We fit
our calculated values of the string tension with the 3-loop beta-function, and extract a value for
Lambda-MSbar, in units of the string tension, for all our values of N, including SU(3). We provide
analytic formulae for estimating the string tension at a given lattice coupling. We calculate the
topological charge Q for N less than or equal to 6, where it fluctuates sufficiently for a plausible
estimate of the continuum topological susceptibility. We also calculate the renormalisation
of the lattice topological charge, ZQ(beta), for all our SU(N) gauge theories, using a standard
definition of the charge, and we provide interpolating formulae, which may be useful in estimating
the renormalisation of the lattice theta parameter. We provide quantitative results for how the
topological charge `freezes' with decreasing lattice spacing and with increasing N. Although
we are able to show that within our typical errors our glueball and string tension results are insensitive
to the freezing of Q at larger N and beta, we choose to perform our calculations with a typical distribution
of Q imposed upon the fields so as to further reduce any potential systematic errors.

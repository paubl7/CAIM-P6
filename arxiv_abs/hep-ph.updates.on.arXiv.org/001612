We demonstrate how S-matrix poles manifest themselves as the physical spectrum near the upper threshold
in the context of the two-channel uniformized Mittag-Leffler expansion, an expression written
as a sum of pole terms under an appropriate variable where the S-matrix is made single-valued (uniformization).
We show that the transition of the spectrum is continuous as a S-matrix pole moves across the boundaries
of the complex energy Riemann sheets and that the physical spectrum peaks at or near the upper threshold
when the S-matrix pole is positioned sufficiently close to it on the uniformized plane. There is
no essential difference on which sheet the pole is positioned. What is important is the existence
of a pole near the upper threshold and the distance between the pole and the physical region, not on
which complex energy sheet the pole is positioned. We also point out that when the pole is close to
the upper threshold, the complex pole does not have the usual meaning of the resonance. Neither the
real part represents the peak energy, nor the imaginary part represents the half width. Subsequently,
we try to understand the current status of $Z(3900)$ from the viewpoint of the uniformized Mittag-Leffler
expansion reflecting in particular, Phys.Rev.Lett.117, 242001 (2016) in which they concluded
that $Z(3900)$ is not a conventional resonance but a threshold cusp. We point out that their results
turn out to indicate the existence of S-matrix poles near the $\bar D D^*$ threshold, which is most
likely the origin of the peak found in their calculation of the near-threshold spectrum. In order
to support our argument, we set up a separable potential model which shares common behavior of poles
near the $\bar D D^*$ threshold to the above-mentioned reference and show in our model that the structures
near the $\bar D D^*$ threshold are indeed caused by these near-threshold poles.

A first order phase transition at the electroweak scale would lead to the production of gravitational
waves that may be observable at upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors such as
LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna). As the Standard Model has no phase transition, LISA
can be used to search for new physics by searching for a stochastic gravitational wave background.
In this work we investigate LISA's sensitivity to the thermodynamic parameters encoded in the stochastic
background produced by a phase transition, using the sound shell model to characterise the gravitational
wave power spectrum, and the Fisher matrix to estimate uncertainties. We explore a parameter space
with transition strengths $\alpha < 0.5$ and phase boundary speeds $0.4 < v_\text{w} < 0.9$, for
transitions nucleating at $T_{\text{N}} = 100$ GeV, with mean bubble spacings $0.1$ and $0.01$
of the Hubble length, and sound speed $c/\sqrt{3}$. We show that the power spectrum in the sound shell
model can be well approximated by a four-parameter double broken power law, and find that the peak
power and frequency can be measured to approximately 10% accuracy for signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)
above 20. Determinations of the underlying thermodynamic parameters are complicated by degeneracies,
but in all cases the phase boundary speed will be the best constrained parameter. Turning to the principal
components of the Fisher matrix, a signal-to-noise ratio above 20 produces a relative uncertainty
less than 3% in the two highest-order principal components, indicating good prospects for combinations
of parameters. The highest-order principal component is dominated by the wall speed. These estimates
of parameter sensitivity provide a preliminary accuracy target for theoretical calculations
of thermodynamic parameters.

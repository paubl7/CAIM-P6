The Seebeck effect and the Nernst effect, reflecting the appearances of a longitudinal electric
field and a transverse electric field, $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$, respectively, induced by a longitudinal
thermal gradient, are studied in QGP at a perpendicular magnetic field placed in $z$-axis. We calculate
the associated Seebeck coefficient ($S_{xx}$) and Nernst signal ($N$) using the relativistic
Boltzmann equation under the relaxation time approximation. In an isotropic QGP, the influences
of magnetic field ($B$) and quark chemical potential ($\mu_{q}$) on these thermoelectric transport
coefficients are investigated. In the presence (absence) of weak magnetic field, we find $S_{xx}$
for a fixed $\mu_{q}$ is negative (positive) in sign, indicating that the dominant carriers for
converting heat gradient to electric field are negatively (positively) charged quarks. The absolute
value of $S_{xx}$ decreases with increasing temperature. Unlike $S_{xx}$, the sign of $N$ is independent
of charge carrier type, and its thermal behavior displays a peak structure. In the presence of strong
magnetic field, the motions of (anti-)quarks perpendicular to magnetic field can be quantized,
only the Seebeck coefficient along the direction of magnetic field, $S_{zz}$, is concentrated.
Our results show that the value of $S_{zz}$ at a fixed $\mu_{q}$ in lowest Landau level (LLL) approximation
always remains positive. Within the effect of high Landau levels, $S_{zz}$ exhibits a thermal structure
similar to that in LLL approximation. As Landau level increases further, $S_{zz}$ decreases and
even its sign changes from positive to negative. The computation of these thermoelectric transport
coefficients are also extended to a medium with momentum-anisotropy induced by initial spatial
expansion as well as strong magnetic field.

Understanding properties of Quark-Gluon Plasma requires an unbiased comparison of experimental
data with theoretical predictions. To that end, we developed the dynamical energy loss formalism
which, in distinction to most other methods, takes into account a realistic medium composed of dynamical
scattering centers. The formalism also allows making numerical predictions for a wide number of
observables with the same parameter set fixed to standard literature values. In this proceedings,
we overview our recently developed DREENA-C and DREENA-B frameworks, where DREENA is a computational
implementation of the dynamical energy loss formalism, and where C stands for constant temperature
QCD medium, while B stands for the medium modeled by 1+1D Bjorken expansion. At constant temperature
our predictions overestimate $v_2$, in contrast to other models, but consistent with simple analytical
estimates. With Bjorken expansion, we have a good agreement of the predictions with both $R_{AA}$
and $v_2$ measurements. We find that introducing medium evolution has a larger effect on $v_2$ predictions,
but for precision predictions it has to be taken into account in $R_{AA}$ predictions as well. Based
on numerical calculations and simple analytical derivations, we also propose a new observable,
which we call path length sensitive suppression ratio, for which we argue that the path length dependence
can be assessed in a straightforward manner. We also argue that $Pb+Pb$ vs. $Xe+Xe$ measurements
make a good system to assess the path length dependence. As an outlook, we expect that introduction
of more complex medium evolution (beyond Bjorken expansion) in the dynamical energy loss formalism
can provide a basis for a state of the art QGP tomography tool - e.g. to jointly constrain the medium
properties from the point of both high pt and low pt data.

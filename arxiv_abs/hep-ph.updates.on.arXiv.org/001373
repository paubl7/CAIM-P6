We investigate unpolarized and polarized gluon distributions and their applications to the Ioffe-time
distributions, which are related to lattice QCD calculations of parton distribution functions.
Guided by the counting rules based on the perturbative QCD at large momentum fraction $x$ and the
color coherence of gluon couplings at small $x$, we parametrize gluon distributions in the helicity
basis. By fitting the unpolarized gluon distribution, the inferred polarized gluon distribution
from our parametrization agrees with the one from global analysis. A simultaneous fit to both unpolarized
and polarized gluon distributions is also performed to explore the model uncertainty. The agreement
with the global analysis supports the $(1-x)$ power suppression of the helicity-antialigned distribution
relative to the helicity-aligned distribution. The corresponding Ioffe-time distributions
and their asymptotic expansions are calculated from the gluon distributions. Our results of the
Ioffe-time distributions can provide guidance to the extrapolation of lattice QCD data to the region
lacking precise gluonic matrix elements. Therefore, they can help regulate the ill-posed inverse
problem associated with extracting the gluon distributions from discrete data from first-principle
calculations, which are available in a limited range of the nucleon momentum and the spatial separation
between the gluonic currents. Given various limitations in obtaining lattice QCD data at large
Ioffe time, phenomenological approaches can provide important complementary information to
extract the gluon distributions in the entire $x$ region. The possibility of investigating higher-twist
effects and other systematic uncertainties in the contemporary first-principle calculations
of parton distributions from phenomenologically well-determined Ioffe-time distributions
in the large Ioffe-time region is also discussed.

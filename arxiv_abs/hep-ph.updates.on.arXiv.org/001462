The ALICE collaboration at the large hadron collider (LHC) recently reported high-statistics
$p_t$ spectrum data from 5 TeV and 13 TeV $p$-$p$ collisions. Particle data for each energy were partitioned
into event classes based on the total yields within two disjoint pseudorapidity $\eta$ intervals
denoted by acronyms V0M and SPD. For each energy the spectra resulting from the two selection methods
were then compared to a minimum-bias INEL $> 0$ average over the entire event population. The nominal
goal was determination of the role of jets in high-multiplicity $p$-$p$ collisions and especially
the jet contribution to the low-$p_t$ parts of spectra. A related motivation was response to recent
claims of "collective" behavior and other nominal indicators of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation
in small collision systems. In the present study a two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of hadron
production in $p$-$p$ collisions is applied to the ALICE spectrum data. As in previous TCM studies
of a variety of A-B collision systems the jet and nonjet contributions to $p$-$p$ spectra are accurately
separated over the entire $p_t$ acceptance. Distinction is maintained among spectrum normalizations,
jet contributions to spectra and systematic biases resulting from V0M and SPD event selection.
The statistical significance of data-model differences is established. The effect of {\em spherocity}
(azimuthal asymmetry measure nominally sensitive to jet production) on ensemble-mean $p_t$ vs
event multiplicity $n_{ch}$ is investigated and found to have little relation to jet production.
The general results of the TCM analysis are as expected from a conventional QCD description of jet
production in $p$-$p$ collisions.

We present for the first time a complete $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ Standard Model calculation of the
inner radiative corrections to Gamow-Teller $\beta$ decays. Upon evaluation most contributions
from photonic vertex and $\gamma W$ box diagrams vanish due to crossing symmetry or cancellation
between isoscalar and isovector photonic contributions, leaving only the polarized parity-odd
contribution, i.e. the Gamow-Teller equivalent of the axial $\gamma W$ box contribution for Fermi
decays. Weak magnetism contributes significantly to the Born amplitude, and we consider additional
hadronic contributions at low energy using a holomorphic continuation of the polarized Bjorken
sum rule constrained by experimental data. We perform the same procedure for the Fermi inner radiative
correction using both Bjorken and Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rules. We discuss heavy flavour, higher-twist
and target mass corrections and find a significant increase at low momentum from the latter. We find
$\Delta_R^A = 0.02881(22)$ and $\Delta_R^V = 0.02473(27)$ for axial and vector inner radiative
corrections, respectively, resulting in $\Delta_R^A - \Delta_R^V = 4.07(8) \times 10^{-3}$,
which is significantly larger than commonly assumed. We have for the first time extracted $g_A^{0}
= 1.2730(13)$ from experimental measurements, a $>2\sigma$ shift from the typically quoted world
average. We discuss consequences for comparing experimental data to lattice calculations in Beyond
Standard Model fits. Further, we show how some traditional $\beta$ decay calculations contain
part of this effect but fail to account for cancellations in the full $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ result.
Finally, we correct for a double-counting instance in the isospin $T=1/2$ mirror decay extraction
of $|V_{ud}|$, the up-down matrix element of the Cabibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element, resolving
a long-standing tension and leading to increased precision.

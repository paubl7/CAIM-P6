The recent announcement of the observation of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ by the LHCb collaboration, if
confirmed, adds a new member to the set of known $P_c$ pentaquarks, which is comprised of the $P_c(4312)$,
$P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$. The $P_{cs}(4459)$ is expected to have the light-quark content of
a $\Lambda$ baryon ($I=0$, $S=-1$), but its spin is unknown. Being close to the $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$
threshold -- $4478\,{\rm MeV}$ in the isospin-symmetric limit -- the molecular hypothesis readily
comes to minds as a possible explanation of this new state. Here we explore how the $P_{cs}(4459)$
might be related to the well-known $P_c$ pentaquark trio. Indeed, SU(3)-flavor and heavy-quark
symmetries suggest the existence of nearby $\bar{D} \Xi_c'$ and $\bar{D} \Xi_c^*$ pentaquarks,
which we might call $P_{cs}'(4437)$ and $P_{cs}^*(4504)$ in reference to their expected masses
and charmed baryon contents. But the $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$ system remains unrelated to the $P_c$'s
in terms of symmetry alone and we will have to resort to phenomenological input to connect these systems.
If we assume light-meson ($\sigma$, $\rho$ and $\omega$) exchange saturation of the contact-range
couplings of an effective field theory describing the $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$, $\bar{D} \Xi_c'$ and
$\bar{D} \Xi_c^*$ molecules, we will be able to predict the existence of $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$ pentaquarks.
The mass of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ will depend on its spin, with concrete calculations yielding $4469\,{\rm
MeV}$ and $4453-4463\,{\rm MeV}$ for $J = \tfrac{1}{2}$ and $J=\tfrac{3}{2}$, respectively.
This might indicate a preference for $J^P = \tfrac{3}{2}^-$ (over $J^P = \tfrac{1}{2}^-$) in the
molecular picture, but this conclusion might not be robust as it relies heavily on phenomenology.

In this work we study the interactions of the $Z$ and $Z'$ generated by kinetic mixing in a class of
theories for physics beyond the SM containing an extra $U(1)_{V}$ gauge factor group and a Higgs
sector respecting custodial symmetry. It is shown that custodial symmetry allows to write the $Z$
and $Z'$ couplings in terms of the measured values of $\alpha$, $\sin\theta_{w}$ and the combinations
$\rho_{0}=M^{2}_{W}/s^{2}_{w}M^{2}_{Z}$ and $\sigma_{0}=M^{2}_{W}/s^{2}_{w}M^{2}_{Z'}$,
such that if we use the results of the global fit to the EWPD, these couplings depend only on known data
and the $Z'$ mass. For the $Z$ sector, we calculate the oblique parameters $S$, $T$, and compare with
the results from the global fit to the EWPD, finding that for $M_{Z'}\geq M_{Z}$ our results are in
agreement with the values extracted from the fit and for $M_{Z'}\geq 200~ GeV$ the oblique parameters
are rather insensitive to the value of the $Z'$ mass. For the $Z'$ sector, we calculate the $Z'$ contributions
to lepton pair production at the LHC. The corresponding cross section depends on the $Z'$ couplings
to SM particles and on its coupling to non-SM particles. We calculate it first considering only the
coupling to SM fermions and show that a comparison with the CMS data on the exclusion curves for the
parameters $c_{u}$ and $c_{d}$ which in general characterize this cross section, excludes the
values $M_{Z'}< 4.4 ~TeV$. We argue that the coupling of the $Z'$ to other SM particles do not modify
this picture but its coupling to non-SM particles does. We estimate these corrections in the well
motivated case of dark matter entering particle physics as the matter fields of the $U(1)_{V}$ gauge
symmetry with perturbative couplings at the electroweak scale, finding that results for $c_{u}$
and $c_{d}$ above are modified by a factor of $1/2$ obtaining the lower limit $M_{Z'}\gtrsim 4 ~TeV$.

Pricing financial derivatives, in particular European-style options at different time-maturities
and strikes, is a relevant financial problem. The dynamics describing the price of vanilla options
when constant volatilities and interest rates are assumed, is governed by the Black-Scholes model,
a linear parabolic partial differential equation with terminal value given by the pay-off of the
option contract and no additional boundary conditions. Here, we present a digital quantum algorithm
to solve Black-Scholes equation on a quantum computer for a wide range of relevant financial parameters
by mapping it to the Schr\"odinger equation. The non-Hermitian nature of the resulting Hamiltonian
is solved by embedding the dynamics into an enlarged Hilbert space, which makes use of only one additional
ancillary qubit. Moreover, we employ a second ancillary qubit to transform initial condition into
periodic boundary conditions, which substantially improves the stability and performance of
the protocol. This algorithm shows a feasible approach for pricing financial derivatives on a digital
quantum computer based on Hamiltonian simulation, technique which differs from those based on
Monte Carlo simulations to solve the stochastic counterpart of the Black Scholes equation. Our
algorithm remarkably provides an exponential speedup since the terms in the Hamiltonian can be
truncated by a polynomial number of interactions while keeping the error bounded. We report expected
accuracy levels comparable to classical numerical algorithms by using 10 qubits and 94 entangling
gates on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, and an expected success probability of the post-selection
procedure due to the embedding protocol above 60\%.

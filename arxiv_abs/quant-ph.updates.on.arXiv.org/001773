Distributed quantum applications impose requirements on the quality of the quantum states that
they consume. When analyzing architecture implementations of quantum hardware, characterizing
this quality forms an important factor in understanding their performance. Fundamental characteristics
of quantum hardware lead to inherent tradeoffs between the quality of states and traditional performance
metrics such as throughput. Furthermore, any real-world implementation of quantum hardware exhibits
time-dependent noise that degrades the quality of quantum states over time. Here, we study the performance
of two possible architectures for interfacing a quantum processor with a quantum network. The first
corresponds to the current experimental state of the art in which the same device functions both
as a processor and a network device. The second corresponds to a future architecture that separates
these two functions over two distinct devices. We model these architectures as Markov chains and
compare their quality of executing quantum operations and producing entangled quantum states
as functions of their memory lifetimes, as well as the time that it takes to perform various operations
within each architecture. As an illustrative example, we apply our analysis to architectures based
on Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond, where we find that for present-day device parameters one
architecture is more suited to computation-heavy applications, and the other for network-heavy
ones. Besides the detailed study of these architectures, a novel contribution of our work are several
formulas that connect an understanding of waiting time distributions to the decay of quantum quality
over time for the most common noise models employed in quantum technologies. This provides a valuable
new tool for performance evaluation experts, and its applications extend beyond the two architectures
studied in this work.

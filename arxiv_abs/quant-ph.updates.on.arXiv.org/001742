Guided by the intuition of coherent superposition of causal relations, recent works presented
quantum processes without classical common-cause and direct-cause explanation, that is, processes
which cannot be written as probabilistic mixtures of quantum common-cause and quantum direct-cause
relations (CCDC). In this work, we analyze the minimum requirements for a quantum process to fail
to admit a CCDC explanation and present "simple" processes, which we prove to be the most robust ones
against general noise. These simple processes can be realized by preparing a maximally entangled
state and applying the identity quantum channel, thus not requiring an explicit coherent mixture
of common-cause and direct-cause, exploiting the possibility of a process to have both relations
simultaneously. We then prove that, although all bipartite direct-cause processes are bipartite
separable operators, there exist bipartite separable processes which are not direct-cause. This
shows that the problem of deciding weather a process is direct-cause process \emph{is not} equivalent
to entanglement certification and points out the limitations of entanglement methods to detect
non-classical CCDC processes. We also present a semi-definite programming hierarchy that can
detect and quantify the non-classical CCDC robustnesses of every non-classical CCDC process.
Among other results, our numerical methods allow us to show that the simple processes presented
here are likely to be also the maximally robust against white noise. Finally, we explore the equivalence
between bipartite direct-cause processes and bipartite processes without quantum memory, to
present a separable process which cannot be realized as a process without quantum memory.

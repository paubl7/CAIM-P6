Employing very simple electro-mechanical principles known from classical physics, the Kibble
balance establishes a very precise and absolute link between quantum electrical standards and
macroscopic mass or force measurements. The success of the Kibble balance, in both determining
fundamental constants ($h$, $N_A$, $e$) and realizing a quasi-quantum mass in the 2019 newly revised
International System of Units, relies on the perfection of Maxwell's equations and the symmetry
they describe between Lorentz's force and Faraday's induction, a principle and a symmetry stunningly
demonstrated in the weighing and velocity modes of Kibble balances to within $1\times10^{-8}$,
with nothing but imperfect wires and magnets. However, recent advances in the understanding of
the current effect in Kibble balances reveal a troubling paradox. A diamagnetic effect, a force
that does not cancel between mass-on and mass-off measurement, is challenging balance maker's
assumptions of symmetry at levels that are almost two orders of magnitude larger than the reported
uncertainties. The diamagnetic effect, if it exists, shows up in weighing mode without a readily
apparent reciprocal effect in the velocity mode, begging questions about systematic errors at
the very foundation of the new measurement system. The hypothetical force is caused by the coil current
changing the magnetic field, producing an unaccounted force that is systematically modulated
with the weighing current. Here we show that this diamagnetic force exists, but the additional force
does not change the equivalence between weighing and velocity measurements. We reveal the unexpected
way that symmetry is preserved and show that for typical materials and geometries the total relative
effect on the measurement is $\approx 1\times10^{-9}$.

In sharp contrast to its classical counterpart, quantum measurement plays a fundamental role in
quantum mechanics and blurs the essential distinction between the measurement apparatus and the
objects under investigation. An appealing phenomenon in quantum measurements, termed as quantum
Zeno effect, can be observed in particular subspaces selected by measurement Hamiltonian. Here
we apply the top-down Zeno mechanism to the particle physics. We indeed develop an alternative insight
into the properties of fundamental particles, but not intend to challenge the Standard Model (SM).
In a unified and simple manner, our effective model allows to merge the origin of neutrino's small
mass and oscillations, the hierarchy pattern for masses of electric charged fermions, the color
confinement, and the discretization of quantum numbers, using a perturbative theory for the dynamical
quantum Zeno effect. Under various conditions for vanishing transition amplitudes among particle
eigenstates in the effective model, it is remarkable to probe results that are somewhat reminiscent
of SM, including: (i) neutrino oscillations with big-angle mixing and small masses emerge from
the energy-momentum conservation, (ii) electrically-charged fermions hold masses in a hierarchy
pattern due to the electric-charge conservation, (iii) color confinement and the associated asymptotic
freedom can be deduced from the color-charge conservation. We make several anticipations about
the basic properties for fundamental particles: (i) the total mass of neutrinos and the existence
of a nearly massless neutrino (of any generation), (ii) the discretization in quantum numbers for
the new-discovered electrically-charged fermions, (iii) the confinement and the associated
asymptotic freedom for any particle containing more than two conserved charges.

We discuss several low-energy backgrounds to sub-GeV dark matter searches, which arise from high-energy
particles of cosmic or radioactive origin that interact with detector materials. We focus on Cherenkov
radiation, transition radiation, and luminescence or phonons from electron-hole pair recombination,
and show that these processes are an important source of backgrounds at both current and planned
detectors. We perform detailed analyses of these backgrounds at several existing and proposed
experiments. We find that a large fraction of the observed single-electron events in the SENSEI
2020 run originate from Cherenkov photons generated by high-energy events in the Skipper-CCD,
and from recombination photons generated in a phosphorus-doped layer of the same instrument. In
a SuperCDMS HVeV 2020 run, Cherenkov photons produced in the sensor holders likely explain the origin
of most of the events containing 2 to 6 electrons. At SuperCDMS SNOLAB, Cherenkov radiation from
radioactive contaminants in Cirlex could dominate the low-energy backgrounds. For EDELWEISS,
Cherenkov or luminescence backgrounds are subdominant to their observed event rate, but could
still limit the sensitivity of their future searches. We also point out that Cherenkov radiation,
transition radiation, and recombination could be a significant source of backgrounds at future
experiments aiming to detect dark-matter via scintillation or phonon signals. The implications
of our results for sub-GeV dark-matter searches and for the design of future detectors are significant.
In particular, several design strategies to mitigate these backgrounds can be implemented, such
as minimizing non-conductive materials near the target, implementing active and passive shielding,
and using multiple detectors. Finally, we speculate on the implications of our results for the development
of quantum computers and neutrino detectors.

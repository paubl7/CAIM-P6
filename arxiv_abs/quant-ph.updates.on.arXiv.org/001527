This thesis reports progress in the analysis of causality and multi-agent logical paradoxes in
quantum and post-quantum theories. These research areas are highly relevant for the foundations
of physics as well as the development of quantum technologies. In the first part, focussing on causality,
we develop techniques for using generalised entropies to analyse distinctions between classical
and non-classical causal structures. We derive new properties of Tsallis entropies of systems
that follow from the relevant causal structure, and apply these to obtain new necessary constraints
for classicality in the Triangle causal structure. Supplementing the method with the post-selection
technique, we provide evidence that Shannon and Tsallis entropic constraints are insufficient
for detecting non-classicality in Bell scenarios with non-binary outcomes. This points to the
need for better methods of characterising correlations in non-classical causal structures. Further,
we investigate the relationships between causality and space-time by developing a framework for
modelling cyclic and fine-tuned influences in non-classical theories. We derive necessary and
sufficient conditions for such causal models to be compatible with a space-time structure and for
ruling out operationally detectable causal loops. In particular, this provides an operational
framework for analysing post-quantum theories admitting jamming non-local correlations. In
the second part, we investigate multi-agent logical paradoxes such as the Frauchiger-Renner paradox
and develop a framework for analysing such paradoxes in arbitrary physical theories. Applying
this to box world, a post-quantum theory, we derive a stronger paradox that does not rely on post-selection.
Our results reveal that reversible evolution of agents' memories is not necessary for deriving
multi-agent paradoxes, and that certain forms of contextuality might be.

We consider an oscillating micromirror replacing one of the two fixed mirrors of a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer. In this ideal optical set-up the quantum oscillator is subjected to the radiation
pressure interaction of travelling light waves, no cavity is involved. This configuration shows
that squeezed light can be generated by pure scattering on a quantum system, without involving a
cavity. The squeezing can be detected at the output ports of the interferometer either by direct
detection or by measuring the spectrum of the difference current. We use the Hudson-Parthasarathy
equation to model the global evolution. It can describe the scattering of photons and the resulting
radiation pressure interaction on the quantum oscillator. It allows to consider also the interaction
with a thermal bath. In this way we have a unitary dynamics giving the evolution of oscillator and
fields. The Bose fields of quantum stochastic calculus and the related generalized Weyl operators
allow to describe the whole optical circuit. By working in the Heisenberg picture, the quantum Langevin
equations for position and momentum and the output fields arise, which are used to describe the monitoring
in continuous time of the light at the output ports. In the case of strong laser and weak radiation
pressure interaction highly non-classical light is produced, and this can be revealed either by
direct detection (a negative Mandel Q-parameter is found), either by the intensity spectrum of
the difference current of two photodetector; in the second case a nearly complete cancellation
of the shot noise can be reached. In this last case it appears that the Mach-Zehnder configuration
together with the detection of the difference current corresponds to an homodyne detection scheme,
so that we can say that the apparatus is measuring the spectrum of squeezing.

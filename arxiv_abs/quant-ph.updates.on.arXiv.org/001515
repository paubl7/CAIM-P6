By leveraging shared entanglement between a pair of qubits, one can teleport a quantum state from
one particle to another. Recent advances have uncovered an intrinsically many-body generalization
of quantum teleportation, with an elegant and surprising connection to gravity. In particular,
the teleportation of quantum information relies on many-body dynamics, which originate from strongly-interacting
systems that are holographically dual to gravity; from the gravitational perspective, such quantum
teleportation can be understood as the transmission of information through a traversable wormhole.
Here, we propose and analyze a new mechanism for many-body quantum teleportation -- dubbed peaked-size
teleportation. Intriguingly, peaked-size teleportation utilizes precisely the same type of
quantum circuit as traversable wormhole teleportation, yet has a completely distinct microscopic
origin: it relies upon the spreading of local operators under generic thermalizing dynamics and
not gravitational physics. We demonstrate the ubiquity of peaked-size teleportation, both analytically
and numerically, across a diverse landscape of physical systems, including random unitary circuits,
the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (at high temperatures), one-dimensional spin chains and a bulk theory
of gravity with stringy corrections. Our results pave the way towards using many-body quantum teleportation
as a powerful experimental tool for: (i) characterizing the size distributions of operators in
strongly-correlated systems and (ii) distinguishing between generic and intrinsically gravitational
scrambling dynamics. To this end, we provide a detailed experimental blueprint for realizing many-body
quantum teleportation in both trapped ions and Rydberg atom arrays; effects of decoherence and
experimental imperfections are analyzed.

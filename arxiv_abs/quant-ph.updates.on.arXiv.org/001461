The zeroth law of thermodynamics involves a transitivity relation (pairwise between three objects)
expressed either in terms of `equal temperature' (ET), or `in equilibrium' (EQ) conditions. In
conventional thermodynamics conditional on vanishingly weak system-bath coupling these two
conditions are commonly regarded as equivalent. In this work we show that for thermodynamics at
strong coupling they are inequivalent: namely, two systems can be in equilibrium and yet have different
effective temperatures. A recent result \cite{NEqFE} for Gaussian quantum systems shows that
an effective temperature $T^{*}$ can be defined at all times during a system's nonequilibrium evolution,
but because of the inclusion of interaction energy, after equilibration the system's $T^*$ is slightly
higher than the bath temperature $T_{\textsc{b}}$, with the deviation depending on the coupling.
A second object coupled with a different strength with an identical bath at temperature $T_{\textsc{b}}$
will not have the same equilibrated temperature as the first object. Thus $ET \neq EQ $ for strong
coupling thermodynamics. We then investigate the conditions for dynamical equilibration for
two objects 1 and 2 strongly coupled with a common bath $B$, each with a different equilibrated effective
temperature. We show this is possible, and prove the existence of a generalized fluctuation-dissipation
relation under this configuration. This affirms that `in equilibrium' is a valid and perhaps more
fundamental notion which the zeroth law for quantum thermodynamics at strong coupling should be
based on. Only when the system-bath coupling becomes vanishingly weak that `temperature' appearing
in thermodynamic relations becomes universally defined and makes better physical sense.

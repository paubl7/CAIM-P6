The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the possibility of constructing a large-scale storage-ring-type
ion-trap system capable of storing, cooling, and controlling a large number of ions as a platform
for scalable quantum computing (QC) and quantum simulations (QS). In such a trap, the ions form a
crystalline beam moving along a circular path with a constant velocity determined by the frequency
and intensity of the cooling lasers. In this paper we consider a large leap forward in terms of the
number of qubits, from fewer than 100 available in state-of-the-art linear ion-trap devices today
to an order of 105 crystallized ions in the storage-ring setup. This new trap design unifies two different
concepts: the storage rings of charged particles and the linear ion traps used for QC and mass spectrometry.
In this paper we use the language of particle accelerators to discuss the ion state and dynamics.
We outline the differences between the above concepts, analyze challenges of the large ring with
a revolving beam of ions, and propose goals for the research and development required to enable future
quantum computers with 1000 times more qubits than available today. The challenge of creating such
a large-scale quantum system while maintaining the necessary coherence of the qubits and the high
fidelity of quantum logic operations is significant. Performing analog quantum simulations may
be an achievable initial goal for such a device. Quantum simulations of complex quantum systems
will move forward both the fundamental science and the applied research. Nuclear and particle physics,
many-body quantum systems, lattice gauge theories, and nuclear structure calculations are just
a few examples in which a large-scale quantum simulation system would be a very powerful tool to move
forward our understanding of nature.

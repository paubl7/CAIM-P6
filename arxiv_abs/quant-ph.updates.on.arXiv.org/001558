Physical platforms such as trapped ions suffer from coherent noise where errors manifest as rotations
about a particular axis and can accumulate over time. We investigate passive mitigation through
decoherence free subspaces, requiring the noise to preserve the code space of a stabilizer code,
and to act as the logical identity operator on the protected information. Thus, we develop conditions
for all transversal $Z$-rotations to preserve the code space of a stabilizer code, which require
the weight-$2$ $Z$-stabilizers to cover all the qubits that are in the support of some $X$-component.
Further, the weight-$2$ $Z$-stabilizers generate a direct product of single-parity-check codes
with even block length. By adjusting the size of these components, we are able to construct a large
family of QECC codes, oblivious to coherent noise, that includes the $[[4L^2, 1, 2L]]$ Shor codes.
By adjusting the size of these components, we are able to construct a large family of QECC codes, oblivious
to coherent noise, that includes the $[[4L^2, 1, 2L]]$ Shor codes. Moreover, given $M$ even and any
$[[n,k,d]]$ stabilizer code, we can construct an $[[Mn, k, \ge d]]$ stabilizer code that is oblivious
to coherent noise. If we require that transversal $Z$-rotations preserve the code space only up
to some finite level $l$ in the Clifford hierarchy, then we can construct higher level gates necessary
for universal quantum computation. The $Z$-stabilizers supported on each non-zero $X$-component
form a classical binary code C, which is required to contain a self-dual code, and the classical Gleason's
theorem constrains its weight enumerator. The conditions for a stabilizer code being preserved
by transversal $2\pi/2^l$ $Z$-rotations at $4 \le l \le l_{\max} <\infty$ level in the Clifford
hierarchy lead to generalizations of Gleason's theorem that may be of independent interest to classical
coding theorists.

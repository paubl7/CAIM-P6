We review recent results on the low-temperature behaviors of the Casimir-Polder and Casimir free
energy an entropy for a polarizable atom interacting with a graphene sheet and for two graphene sheets,
respectively. These results are discussed in the wide context of problems arising in the Lifshitz
theory of van der Waals and Casimir forces when it is applied to metallic and dielectric bodies. After
a brief treatment of different approaches to theoretical description of the electromagnetic response
of graphene, we concentrate on the derivation of response function in the framework of thermal quantum
field theory in the Matsubara formulation using the polarization tensor in (2+1)-dimensional
space-time. The asymptotic expressions for the Casimir-Polder and Casimir free energy and entropy
at low temperature, obtained with the polarization tensor, are presented for a pristine graphene
as well as for graphene sheets possessing some nonzero energy gap $\Delta$ and chemical potential
$\mu$ under different relationships between the values of $\Delta$ and $\mu$. Along with reviewing
the results obtained in the literature, we present some new findings concerning the case of zero
gap and nonzero chemical potential. The conclusion is made that the Lifshitz theory of the Casimir
and Casimir-Polder forces in graphene systems using the quantum field theoretical description
of a pristine graphene, as well as real graphene sheets with $\Delta>2\mu$ or $\Delta<2\mu$, is
consistent with the requirements of thermodynamics. The case of graphene with $\Delta=2\mu\neq
0$ leads to an entropic anomaly, but is argued to be physically unrealistic. The way to a resolution
of thermodynamic problems in the Lifshitz theory based on the results obtained for graphene is discussed.

The ontological aspect of Bohmian mechanics, as a hidden-variable theory that provides us with
an objective description of a quantum world without observers, is widely known. Yet its practicality
is getting more and more acceptance and relevance, for it has proven to be an efficient and useful
resource to tackle, explore, describe and explain such phenomena. This practical aspect emerges
precisely when the pragmatic application of the formalism prevails over any other interpretational
question, still a matter of debate and controversy. In this regard, the purpose here is to show and
discuss how Bohmian mechanics emphasizes in a natural manner a series of dynamical features difficult
to find out through other quantum approaches. This arises from the fact that Bohmian mechanics allows
us to establish a direct link between the dynamics exhibited by quantum systems and the local variations
of the quantum phase associated with their state. To illustrate these facts, simple models of two
physically insightful quantum phenomena have been chosen, namely, the dispersion of a free Gaussian
wave packet and Young-type two-slit interference. As it is shown, the outcomes from their analysis
render a novel, alternative understanding of the dynamics displayed by these quantum phenomena
in terms of the underlying local velocity field that connects the probability density with the quantum
flux. This field, nothing but the so-called guidance condition in standard Bohmian mechanics,
thus acquires a prominent role to understand quantum dynamics, as the mechanism responsible for
such dynamics. This goes beyond the passive role typically assigned to this field in Bohmian mechanics,
where traditionally trajectories and quantum potentials have received more attention instead.

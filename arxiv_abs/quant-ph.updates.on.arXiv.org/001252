$Circuit~ Complexity$, a well known computational technique has recently become the backbone
of the physics community to probe the chaotic behaviour and random quantum fluctuations of quantum
fields. This paper is devoted to the study of out-of-equilibrium aspects and quantum chaos appearing
in the universe from the paradigm of two well known bouncing cosmological solutions viz. $Cosine~
hyperbolic$ and $Exponential$ models of scale factors. Besides $circuit~ complexity$, we use
the $Out-of-Time~ Ordered~ correlation~ (OTOC)$ functions for probing the random behaviour of
the universe both at early and the late times. In particular, we use the techniques of well known two-mode
squeezed state formalism in cosmological perturbation theory as a key ingredient for the purpose
of our computation. To give an appropriate theoretical interpretation that is consistent with
the observational perspective we use the scale factor and the number of e-foldings as a dynamical
variable instead of conformal time for this computation. From this study, we found that the period
of post bounce is the most interesting one. Though it may not be immediately visible, but an exponential
rise can be seen in the $complexity$ once the post bounce feature is extrapolated to the present time
scales. We also find within the very small acceptable error range a universal connecting relation
between Complexity computed from two different kinds of cost functionals-$linearly~ weighted$
and $geodesic~ weighted$ with the OTOC. Furthermore, from the $complexity$ computation obtained
from both the cosmological models and also using the well known MSS bound on quantum Lyapunov exponent,
$\lambda\leq 2\pi/\beta$ for the saturation of chaos, we estimate the lower bound on the equilibrium
temperature of our universe at late time scale. Finally, we provide a rough estimation of the scrambling
time period in terms of conformal time.

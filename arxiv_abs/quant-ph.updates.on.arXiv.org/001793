Quantum computers are poised to revolutionize the simulation of quantum-mechanical systems in
physics and chemistry. Current quantum computers execute their algorithms imperfectly, due to
uncorrected noise, gate errors, and decoherence. This severely limits the size and scope of protocols
which can be run on near-term quantum hardware. Much research has been focused on building more robust
hardware to address this issue, however the advantages of more robust algorithms remains largely
unexplored. Here we show that algorithms for solving the driven-dissipative many-body problem,
among the hardest problems in quantum mechanics, are inherently robust against errors. We find
it is possible to solve dissipative problems requiring deep circuits on current quantum devices
due to the contractive nature of their time evolution maps. We simulate one thousand steps of time
evolution for the non-interacting limit of the infinite driven-dissipative Hubbard model, calculate
the current through the system and prepare a thermal state of the atomic limit of the Hubbard model.
These problems were solved using circuits containing up to two thousand entangling gates on quantum
computers made available by IBM, showing no signs of decreasing fidelity at long times. Our results
demonstrate that algorithms for simulating dissipative problems are able to far out-perform similarly
complex non-dissipative algorithms on noisy hardware. Our two algorithmic primitives are the
basic building blocks of many condensed-matter-physics systems, and we anticipate their demonstrated
robustness to hold when generalized to solve the full many-body driven-dissipative quantum problem.
Building upon the algorithms presented here may prove to be the most promising approach to tackle
important, classically intractable problems on quantum computers before error correction is
available.

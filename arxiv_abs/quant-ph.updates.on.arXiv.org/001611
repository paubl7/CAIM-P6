It is well known that photons can carry a spatial structure akin to a "twisted" or "rippled" wavefront.
Such structured light fields have sparked significant interest in both classical and quantum physics,
with applications ranging from dense communications to light-matter interaction. Harnessing
the full advantage of transverse spatial photonic encoding using the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) basis
in the quantum domain requires control over both the azimuthal (twisted) and radial (rippled) components
of photons. However, precise measurement of the radial photonic degree-of-freedom has proven
to be experimentally challenging primarily due to its transverse amplitude structure. Here we
demonstrate the generation and certification of full-field Laguerre-Gaussian entanglement
between photons pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion in the telecom regime.
By precisely tuning the optical system parameters for state generation and collection, and adopting
recently developed techniques for precise spatial mode measurement, we are able to certify fidelities
up to 85\% and entanglement dimensionalities up to 26 in a 43-dimensional radial and azimuthal LG
mode space. Furthermore, we study two-photon quantum correlations between 9 LG mode groups, demonstrating
a correlation structure related to mode group order and inter-modal cross-talk. In addition, we
show how the noise-robustness of high-dimensional entanglement certification can be significantly
increased by using measurements in multiple LG mutually unbiased bases. Our work demonstrates
the potential offered by the full spatial structure of the two-photon field for enhancing technologies
for quantum information processing and communication.

Entanglement is a defining feature of quantum mechanics that can be a resource in engineered and
natural systems, but measuring entanglement in experiment remains elusive especially for large
chemical systems. Most practical approaches require determining and measuring a suitable entanglement
witness which provides some level of information about the entanglement structure of the probed
state. A fundamental quantity of quantum metrology is the quantum Fisher information (QFI) which
is a rigorous witness of multipartite entanglement that can be evaluated from linear response functions
for certain states. In this work, we explore measuring the QFI of molecular exciton states of the
first-excitation subspace from spectroscopy. In particular, we utilize the fact that the linear
response of a pure state subject to a weak electric field over all possible driving frequencies encodes
the variance of the collective dipole moment in the probed state, which is a valid measure for QFI.
The systems that are investigated include the molecular dimer, $N$-site linear aggregate with
nearest-neighbor coupling, and $N$-site circular aggregate, all modeled as a collection of interacting
qubits. Our theoretical analysis shows that the variance of the collective dipole moment in the
brightest dipole-allowed eigenstate is the maximum QFI. The optical response of a thermally equilibrated
state in the first-excitation subspace is also a valid QFI. Theoretical predictions of the measured
QFI for realistic linear dye aggregates as a function of temperature and energetic disorder due
to static variations of the host matrix show that 2- to 3-partite entanglement is realizable. This
work lays some groundwork and inspires measurement of multipartite entanglement of molecular
excitons with ultrafast pump-probe experiments.

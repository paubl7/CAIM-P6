As quantum computers mature, quantum error correcting codes (QECs) will be adopted in order to suppress
errors to any desired level $\mathcal{E}$ at a cost in qubit-count $n$ that is merely poly-logarithmic
in $\mathcal{E}^{-1}$. However in the NISQ era, the complexity and scale required to adopt even
the smallest QEC is prohibitive. Instead, error mitigation techniques have been employed; typically
these do not require a significant increase in qubit-count but cannot provide exponential error
suppression. Here we show that, for the crucial case of estimating expectation values of observables
(key to almost all NISQ algorithms) one can indeed achieve an effective exponential suppression.
At the cost of a qubit count increase by a factor of $n\geq 2$ the error becomes $Q^n$ where $Q<1$ is
a suppression factor that depends on the entropy of the error probabilities. The approach takes
$n$ independently-prepared circuit outputs and applies a controlled derangement operator to
create a state whose symmetries prevent error-burdened states from contributing bias to the expected
value. The approach is therefore `NISQ-friendly' as it is modular in the main computation and requires
only a shallow circuit that bridges the $n$ copies immediately prior to measurement. Imperfections
in our derangement circuit do degrade performance and therefore we propose an approach to efficiently
mitigate this effect to arbitrary precision due to the remarkable properties of derangements.
a) they decompose into a linear number of elementary gates -- limiting the impact of noise b) they
are highly resilient to noise and the effect of imperfections on them is (almost) trivial. In numerical
simulations validating our approach we confirm error suppression below $10^{-6}$ for circuits
consisting of several hundred noisy gates (two-qubit gate error $0.5\%$) using no more than $n=4$
circuit copies.

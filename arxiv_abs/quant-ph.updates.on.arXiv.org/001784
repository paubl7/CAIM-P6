We first consider the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox for the system of two particles with
spin 1/2 with entangled spins in first-quantized quantum mechanics (QM). If measurement is governed
by wavefunction collapse, then gedanken experiments show that a number of fundamental principles
including conservation of angular momentum and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle can be violated.
We conclude that the collapse of the spin part of the wavefunction cannot happen and therefore an
EPR paradox does not arise for this system. QM unitarity alone is sufficient to rule out "spooky"
action at a distance. The absence of spin wavefunction collapse leads to several interesting conclusions
about how measurement works in QM: When wavefunction collapse does not happen, (i) a signal from
a macroscopic measuring device indicating that a system is in a state S does not necessarily mean
that it is or was in S and (ii) the uncertainty in QM at the microscopic level is transmitted to uncertainty
in signals for the macroscopic measuring device. We derive two general results on how quantum measurement
works and illustrate them in a spin-1/2 measurement. In contrast to first-quantized QM, in quantum
field theory we are unable to fully rule out the possibility of wavefunction collapse. However,
when we insist on unitarity (thereby excluding the possibility of wavefunction collapse) and additionally
take into account in the wavefunction all degrees of freedom involved in the measurement (including
those of the equipment, experimentalists, etc.), a consistant acceptable understanding of the
Bell-inequality-type experiments involving entangled photon polarizations emerges including
the absence of an EPR paradox. The ability of an experimentalist to be aware of his perceptions but
unable to be conscious of other components of a generalized Schrodinger Cat plays a role in resolving
the Measurement Problem.

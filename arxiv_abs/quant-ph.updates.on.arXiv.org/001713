Twin-field quantum key distribution (TFQKD) systems have shown great promise for implementing
practical long-distance secure quantum communication due to its measurement-device-independent
nature and its ability to offer fundamentally superior rate-loss scaling than point-to-point
QKD systems. A surge of research and development effort in the last two years has produced many variants
of protocols and experimental demonstrations. In terms of hardware topology, TFQKD systems interfering
quantum signals from two remotely phase-locked laser sources are in essence giant Mach-Zehnder
interferometers (MZIs) requiring active phase stabilization. Such configurations are inherently
unsuitable for a TFQKD network, where more than one user-pair share the common quantum measurement
station, because it is practically extremely difficult, if not impossible, to stabilize MZIs of
largely disparate path lengths, a situation that is inevitable in a multi-user-pair TFQKD network.
On the other hand, Sagnac interferometer based TFQKD systems exploiting the inherent phase stability
of the Sagnac ring can implement asymmetric TFQKD, and are therefore eminently suitable for implementing
a TFQKD network. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a proof-of-principle multi-user-pair
Sagnac TFQKD network where three user pairs sharing the same measurement station can perform pair-wise
TFQKD through time multiplexing, with channel losses up to 58 dB, and channel loss asymmetry up to
15 dB. In some cases, the secure key rates still beat the rate-loss bounds for point-to-point repeaterless
QKD systems, even in this network configuration. It is to our knowledge the first multi-user-pair
TFQKD network demonstration, an important step in advancing quantum communication network technologies.

This thesis addresses problems in the field of quantum information theory. The first part of the
thesis is opened with concrete definitions of general quantum source models and their compression,
and each subsequent chapter addresses the compression of a specific source model as a special case
of the initially defined general models. First, we find the optimal compression rate of a general
mixed state source which includes as special cases all the previously studied models such as Schumacher's
pure and ensemble sources and other mixed state ensemble models. For an interpolation between the
visible and blind Schumacher's ensemble model, we find the optimal compression rate region for
the entanglement and quantum rates. Later, we study the classical-quantum variation of the celebrated
Slepian-Wolf problem and the ensemble model of quantum state redistribution for which we find the
optimal compression rate considering per-copy fidelity and single-letter achievable and converse
bounds matching up to continuity of functions which appear in the corresponding bounds. The second
part of the thesis revolves around information theoretical perspective of quantum thermodynamics.
We start with a resource theory point of view of a quantum system with multiple non-commuting charges.
Subsequently, we apply this resource theory framework to study a traditional thermodynamics setup
with multiple non-commuting conserved quantities consisting of a main system, a thermal bath and
batteries to store various conserved quantities of the system. We state the laws of the thermodynamics
for this system, and show that a purely quantum effect happens in some transformations of the system,
that is, some transformations are feasible only if there are quantum correlations between the final
state of the system and the thermal bath.

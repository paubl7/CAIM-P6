In the frames of classical mechanics the generalized Langevin equation is derived for an arbitrary
mechanical subsystem coupled to the harmonic bath of a solid. A time-acting temperature operator
is introduced for the quantum Klein-Kramers and Smoluchowski equations, accounting for the effect
of the quantum thermal bath oscillators. The model of Brownian emitters is theoretically studied
and the relevant evolutionary equations for the probability density are derived. The Schrodinger
equation is explained via collisions of the target point particles with the quantum force carriers,
transmitting the fundamental interactions between the point particles. Thus, electrons and other
point particles are no waves and the wavy chapter of quantum mechanics originated for the force carriers.
A stochastic Lorentz-Langevin equation is proposed to describe the underlaying Brownian-like
motion of the point particles in quantum mechanics. Considering the Brownian dynamics in the frames
of the Bohmian mechanics, the density functional Bohm-Langevin equation is proposed, and the relevant
Smoluchowski-Bohm equation is derived. A nonlinear master equation is proposed by proper quantization
of the classical Klein-Kramers equation. Its equilibrium solution in the exact canonical Gibbs
density operator, while the well-known Caldeira-Leggett equation is simply a linearization at
high temperature. In the case of a free quantum Brownian particles, a new law for the spreading of
the wave packet it discovered, which represents the quantum generalization of the classical Einstein
law of Brownian motion. A new projector operator is proposed for the collapse of the wave function
of a quantum particle moving in a classical environment. Its application results in dissipative
Schrodinger equations, as well as in a new form of dissipative Liouville equation in classical mechanics.

The solving of linear systems provides a rich area to investigate the use of nearer-term, noisy,
intermediate-scale quantum computers. In this work, we discuss hybrid quantum-classical algorithms
for skewed linear systems for over-determined and under-determined cases. Our input model is such
that the columns or rows of the matrix defining the linear system are given via quantum circuits of
poly-logarithmic depth and the number of circuits is much smaller than their Hilbert space dimension.
Our algorithms have poly-logarithmic dependence on the dimension and polynomial dependence in
other natural quantities. In addition, we present an algorithm for the special case of a factorized
linear system with run time poly-logarithmic in the respective dimensions. At the core of these
algorithms is the Hadamard test and in the second part of this paper we consider the optimization
of the circuit depth of this test. Given an $n$-qubit and $d$-depth quantum circuit $\mathcal{C}$,
we can approximate $\langle 0|\mathcal{C}|0\rangle$ using $(n + s)$ qubits and $O\left(\log s
+ d\log (n/s) + d\right)$-depth quantum circuits, where $s\leq n$. In comparison, the standard
implementation requires $n+1$ qubits and $O(dn)$ depth. Lattice geometries underlie recent quantum
supremacy experiments with superconducting devices. We also optimize the Hadamard test for an
$(l_1\times l_2)$ lattice with $l_1 \times l_2 = n$, and can approximate $\langle 0|\mathcal{C}
|0\rangle$ with $(n + 1)$ qubits and $O\left(d \left(l_1 + l_2\right)\right)$-depth circuits.
In comparison, the standard depth is $O\left(d n^2\right)$ in this setting. Both of our optimization
methods are asymptotically tight in the case of one-depth quantum circuits $\mathcal{C}$.

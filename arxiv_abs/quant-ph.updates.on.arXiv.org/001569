Characterizing those quantum channels that correspond to Markovian time evolutions is an open
problem in quantum information theory, even different notions of quantum Markovianity exist.
One such notion is that of infinitesimal Markovian divisibility for quantum channels introduced
in arXiv:math-ph/0611057. Whereas there is a complete characterization for infinitesimal Markovian
divisible qubit channels, no necessary or sufficient criteria are known for higher dimensions,
except for necessity of non-negativity of the determinant. We describe how to extend the notion
of infinitesimal Markovian divsibility to general linear maps and closed and convex sets of generators.
We give a general approach towards proving necessary criteria for (infinitesimal) Markovian divisibility
that involve singular values of the linear map. With this approach, we prove two necessary criteria
for infinitesimal divisibility of quantum channels that work in any finite dimension $d$: an upper
bound on the determinant in terms of a $\Theta(d)$-power of the smallest singular value, and in terms
of a product of $\Theta(d)$ smallest singular values. Our criteria allow us to analytically construct,
in any given dimension, a set of channels that contains provably non infinitesimal Markovian divisible
ones. We also discuss the classical counterpart of this scenario, i.e., stochastic matrices with
the generators given by transition rate matrices. Here, we show that no necessary criteria for infinitesimal
Markovian divisibility of the form proved for quantum channels can hold in general. However, we
describe subsets of all transition rate matrices for which our reasoning can be applied to obtain
necessary conditions for Markovian divisibility.

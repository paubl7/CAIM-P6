Quantum control can be employed in quantum metrology to improve the precision limit for the estimation
of unknown parameters. The optimal control, however, typically depends on the actual values of
the parameters which then needs to be designed adaptively with the updated estimations of those
parameters. Traditional methods, such as gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), need to be
rerun for each new set of parameters encountered, making the optimization costly especially when
many parameters are involved. Here we study the generalizability of optimal control, namely optimal
controls that can be systematically updated across a range of parameters with minimal cost. In cases
where control channels can completely reverse the shift in the Hamiltonian due to change in parameters,
we provide an analytical method which efficiently generates optimal controls for any parameter
starting from an initial optimal control found either by GRAPE or reinforcement learning. When
the control channels are restricted, the analytical scheme is invalid but reinforcement learning
still retains a level of generalizability, albeit in a narrower range. Lastly, in cases where the
shift in the Hamiltonian is impossible to be decomposed to available control channels, no generalizability
is found for either the reinforcement learning or the analytical scheme. We argue that the generalization
of reinforcement learning is through a mechanism similar to the analytical scheme. Our results
provide insights on when and how the optimal control in multi-parameter quantum metrology can be
generalized, thereby facilitating efficient implementation of optimal quantum estimation of
multiple parameters, particularly for an ensemble of systems with ranges of parameters.

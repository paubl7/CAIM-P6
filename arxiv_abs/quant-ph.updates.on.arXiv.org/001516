We study Smith-Purcell radiation from a conducting grating generated by a vortex electron with
an orbital angular momentum $\ell \hbar$, described as a generalized Laguerre-Gaussian packet,
which has an intrinsic magnetic dipole moment and an electric quadrupole moment. By using a multipole
expansion of the electromagnetic field of such an electron, we employ a generalized surface-current
method, applicable for a wide range of parameters. The radiated energy contains contributions
from the charge, from the magnetic moment, and from the electric quadrupole moment, as well as from
their interference. The quadrupole contribution grows as the packet spreads while propagating,
and it is enhanced for large $\ell$. In contrast to the linear growth of the radiation intensity from
the charge with a number of strips $N$, the quadrupole contribution reveals an $N^3$ dependence,
which puts a limit on the maximal grating length for which the radiation losses stay small. We study
spectral-angular distributions of the Smith-Purcell radiation both analytically and numerically
and demonstrate that the electron's vorticity can give rise to detectable effects for non-relativistic
and moderately relativistic electrons. On a practical side, preparing the incoming electron's
state in a form of a non-Gaussian packet with a quadrupole moment -- such as the vortex electron, an
Airy beam, a Schr\"odinger cat state, and so on -- one can achieve quantum enhancement of the radiation
power compared to the classical linear regime. Such an enhancement would be a hallmark of a previously
unexplored quantum regime of radiation, in which non-Gaussianity of the packet influences the
radiation properties much stronger than the quantum recoil.

We propose a measure, which we call the dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF), to characterize
the spectral statistics of non-Hermitian (and non-Unitary) matrices. We show that DSFF successfully
diagnoses dissipative quantum chaos, and reveals correlations between real and imaginary parts
of the complex eigenvalues up to arbitrary energy (and time) scale. Specifically, we provide the
exact solution of DSFF for the complex Ginibre ensemble (GinUE) and for a Poissonian random spectrum
(Poisson) as minimal models of dissipative quantum chaotic and integrable systems respectively.
For dissipative quantum chaotic systems, we show that DSFF exhibits an exact rotational symmetry
in its complex time argument $\tau$. Analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) behaviour for Gaussian
unitary ensemble, DSFF for GinUE shows a "dip-ramp-plateau" behavior in $|\tau|$: DSFF initially
decreases, increases at intermediate time scales, and saturates after a generalized Heisenberg
time which scales as the inverse mean level spacing. Remarkably, for large matrix size, the "ramp"
of DSFF for GinUE increases quadratically in $|\tau|$, in contrast to the linear ramp in SFF for Hermitian
ensembles. For dissipative quantum integrable systems, we show that DSFF takes a constant value
except for a region in complex time whose size and behavior depends on the eigenvalue density. Numerically,
we verify the above claims and additionally compute DSFF for real and quaternion real Ginibre ensembles.
As a physical example, we consider the quantum kicked top model with dissipation, and show that it
falls under the universality class of GinUE and Poisson as the `kick' is switched on or off. Lastly,
we study spectral statistics of ensembles of random classical stochastic matrices or Markov chains,
and show that these models fall under the class of Ginibre ensemble.

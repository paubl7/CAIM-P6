This work aims to investigate the corrosion inhibition of the mild steel in the 1 M HCl solution by
1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulphate 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulphate,
and 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, using electrochemical, weight loss, and surface
analysis methods as well as the full quantum-mechanical treatment. Polarization measurements
prove that studied compounds are mixed-type inhibitors with a predominantly anodic reaction.
The inhibition efficiency obtained from the polarization curves is about 80-92% for all of the 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium
salts with a concentration higher than 0.005 mol/l, while it is much lower for 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
hydrogen sulphate. The values measured in the weight loss experiments (after seven days) are to
some extent higher (reaching up to 98% efficiency). Furthermore, we have shown that the influence
of the alkyl chain length on the inhibition efficiency is much larger than that of the anion type.
Furthermore, we obtain a realistic model of a single molecule on iron surface Fe(110) by applying
the Density Functional Theory calculations. We use the state-of-the-art computational approach,
including the meta-GGA strongly-constrained and appropriately normed semilocal density functional
to model the electronic structure properties of both free and bounded-to-surface molecules of
1-butyl-, 1-hexyl-, and 1-octyl-3-methylimizadolium bromide, chloride, and hydrogen sulphate.
From the calculations we extract, the HOMO/LUMO gap, hardness, electronegativity, and charge
transfer of electrons from/to molecules-in-question. It supports the experimental findings
and explains the influence of the alkyl chain length and the functional group on the inhibition process.

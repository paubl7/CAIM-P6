Quantum entanglement of a many-body system is encoded in the reduced density matrix $\rho_{\mathrm
o}$, which is related to \textit{not only} Hamiltonian \textit{but also} how the real-space is
partitioned into two subregions. In this paper, we propose a mathematically rigorous duality to
diagnose quantum entanglement of non-Hermitian non-interacting systems with a complete set of
biorthonormal eigenvectors and an entirely real spectrum. The real space is partitioned via a projecting
operator $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm o}$. After dualization, we obtain a new reduced density matrix
$\rho_{\mathrm{d}}$ and a new real space projector $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm d}$. Remarkably, entanglement
spectrum and entanglement entropy keep invariant. Inspired by the duality, we defined two types
of non-Hermitian models, when $\mathcal R_{\mathrm{o}}$ is given. In type-I exemplified by the
"non-reciprocal model", there exists at least one duality such that $\rho_{\mathrm{d}}$ is Hermitian.
In other words, entanglement information of type-I non-Hermitian models with a given $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{o}}$
is entirely controlled by Hermitian models with $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{d}}$ that may be quite
different from $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{o}}$. As a result, we are allowed to apply known results
of Hermitian systems to efficiently extract entanglement information of type-I models. On the
other hand, the duals of type-II models, exemplified by "non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model", are always non-Hermitian. For the practical purpose, the duality provides a potentially
\textit{efficient} computation approach to entanglement of non-Hermitian systems. By building
bridges between different models, the duality also sheds lights on the role of non-Hermiticity
played in quantum entanglement, paving the way to systematic entanglement diagnosis of non-Hermitian
systems.

State-of-the-art sensors of force, motion and magnetic fields have reached the sensitivity where
the quantum noise of the meter is significant or even dominant. In particular, the sensitivity of
the best optomechanical devices has reached the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), which directly follows
from the Heisenberg uncertainty relation and corresponds to balancing the measurement imprecision
and the perturbation of the probe by the quantum back action of the meter. The SQL is not truly fundamental
and several methods for its overcoming have been proposed and demonstrated. At the same time, two
quantum sensitivity constraints which are more fundamental are known. The first limit arises from
the finiteness of the probing strength (in the case of optical interferometers - of the circulating
optical power) and is known as the Energetic Quantum Limit or, in a more general context, as the Quantum
Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound (QCRB). The second limit arises from the dissipative dynamics of the probe,
which prevents full efficacy of the quantum back action evasion techniques developed for overcoming
the SQL. No particular name has been assigned to this limit; we propose the term Dissipative Quantum
Limit (DQL) for it. Here we develop a unified theory of these two fundamental limits by deriving the
general sensitivity constraint from which they follow as particular cases. Our analysis reveals
a phase transition occurring at the boundary between the QCRB-dominated and the DQL regimes, manifested
by the discontinuous derivatives of the optimal spectral densities of the meter field quantum noise.
This leads to the counter-intuitive (but favorable) finding that quantum-limited sensitivity
can be achieved with certain lossy meter systems. Finally, we show that the DQL originates from the
non-autocommutativity of the internal thermal noise of the probe and that it can be overcome in non-stationary
measurements.

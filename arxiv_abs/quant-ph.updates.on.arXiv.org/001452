We propose a new theory to characterize equilibrium topological phase with non-equilibrium quantum
dynamics by introducing the concept of high-order topological charges, with novel phenomena being
predicted. Through a dimension reduction approach, we can characterize a $d$-dimensional ($d$D)
integer-invariant topological phase with lower-dimensional topological number quantified
by high-order topological charges, of which the $s$th-order topological charges denote the monopoles
confined on the $(s-1)$th-order band inversion surfaces (BISs) that are $(d-s+1)$D momentum subspaces.
The bulk topology is determined by the $s$th order topological charges enclosed by the $s$th-order
BISs. By quenching the system from trivial phase to topological regime, we show that the bulk topology
of post-quench Hamiltonian can be detected through a high-order dynamical bulk-surface correspondence,
in which both the high-order topological charges and high-order BISs are identified from quench
dynamics. This characterization theory has essential advantages in two aspects. First, the highest
($d$th) order topological charges are characterized by only discrete signs of spin-polarization
in zero dimension (i.e. the $0$th Chern numbers), whose measurement is much easier than the $1$st-order
topological charges that are characterized by the continuous charge-related spin texture in higher
dimensional space. Secondly, a more striking result is that a first-order high integer-valued
topological charge always reduces to multiple highest-order topological charges with unit charge
value, and the latter can be readily detected in experiment. The two fundamental features greatly
simplify the characterization and detection of the topological charges and also topological phases,
which shall advance the experimental studies in the near future.

Capacities of quantum channels and decoherence times both quantify the extent to which quantum
information can withstand degradation by interactions with its environment. However, calculating
capacities directly is known to be intractable in general. Much recent work has focused on upper
bounding certain capacities in terms of more tractable quantities such as specific norms from operator
theory. In the meantime, there has also been substantial recent progress on estimating decoherence
times with techniques from analysis and geometry, even though many hard questions remain open.
In this article, we introduce a class of continuous-time quantum channels that we called transferred
channels, which are built through representation theory from a classical Markov kernel defined
on a compact group. We study two subclasses of such kernels: H\"ormander systems on compact Lie-groups
and Markov chains on finite groups. Examples of transferred channels include the depolarizing
channel, the dephasing channel, and collective decoherence channels acting on $d$ qubits. Some
of the estimates presented are new, such as those for channels that randomly swap subsystems. We
then extend tools developed in earlier work by Gao, Junge and LaRacuente to transfer estimates of
the classical Markov kernel to the transferred channels and study in this way different non-commutative
functional inequalities. The main contribution of this article is the application of this transference
principle to the estimation of various capacities as well as estimation of entanglement breaking
times, defined as the first time for which the channel becomes entanglement breaking. Moreover,
our estimates hold for non-ergodic channels such as the collective decoherence channels, an important
scenario that has been overlooked so far because of a lack of techniques.

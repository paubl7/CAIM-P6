In open quantum systems, it is known that if the system and environment are in a product state, the
evolution of the system is given by a linear completely positive (CP) Hermitian map. CP maps are a
subset of general linear Hermitian maps, which also include non completely positive (NCP) maps.
NCP maps can arise in evolutions such as non-Markovian evolution, where the CP divisibility of the
map (writing the overall evolution as a composition of CP maps) usually fails. Positive but NCP maps
are also useful as entanglement witnesses. In this paper, we focus on transforming NCP maps to CP
maps through composition with the asymmetric depolarizing map. We use separate asymmetric depolarizing
maps acting on the individual subsystems. Previous work have looked at structural physical approximation
(SPA), which is a CP approximation of a NCP map using a mixture of the NCP map with a completely depolarizing
map. We prove that the composition can always be made CP without completely depolarizing in any direction.
It is often possible to depolarize less in some directions. We give the general proof by using the
Choi matrix and an isomorphism from a maximally entangled two qudit state to qubits. We also give
measures that describe the amount of disturbance the depolarization introduces to the original
map. Given our measures, we show that asymmetric depolarization has many advantages over SPA in
preserving the structure of the original NCP map. Finally, we give some examples. For some measures
and examples, completely depolarizing (while not necessary) in some directions can give a better
approximation than keeping the depolarizing parameters bounded by the required depolarization
if symmetric depolarization is used.

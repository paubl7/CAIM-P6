In order to solve the problem of data dimensionality reduction in quantum cloud computing under
the premise of ensuring security. A quantum principal component extraction algorithm is proposed.
And based on QPCE, a quantum homomorphic ciphertext dimensionality reduction scheme (QHEDR) is
proposed in quantum cloud computing. At present, in quantum computing, a non-interactive and completely
secure quantum fully homomorphic encryption scheme can be designed through the superposition
and entanglement of quantum states. In the face of the huge and complex data in cloud computing, the
parallel computing ability of quantum computing is also particularly important. Quantum principal
component analysis algorithm is used as a method of quantum state tomography. We perform feature
extraction on the eigenvalue matrix of the density matrix after feature decomposition to achieve
dimensionality reduction. Compared with the classic algorithm, this algorithm achieves an exponential
speedup under certain conditions. The specific realization of the quantum circuit is given. And
considering the limited computing power of the client, the client can encrypt the quantum data and
upload it to the cloud for computing. And through the quantum homomorphic encryption scheme to ensure
security. After the calculation is completed, the client updates the key locally and decrypts the
ciphertext result. We have implemented a quantum ciphertext dimensionality reduction scheme
implemented in the quantum cloud, which does not require interaction and ensures safety. In addition,
we have carried out experimental verification on the QPCE algorithm on IBM's real computing platform,
and given a simple example of executing hybrid quantum circuits in the cloud to verify the correctness
of our scheme. Experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively perform the dimensionality
reduction of ciphertext.

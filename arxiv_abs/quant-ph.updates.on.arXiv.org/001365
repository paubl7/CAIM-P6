If the systems of quantum theory are thought of as elementary information carriers in the first place,
rather than elementary constituents of matter, and their connections are logical connections
within a given algorithm, rather than space-time relations, then we need to find the origin of mechanical
concepts---that characterise quantum mechanics as a theory of physical systems. To this end, we
will illustrate how physical laws can be viewed as algorithms for the update of memory registers
that make a physical system. Imposing the characteristic properties of physical laws to such an
algorithm, i.e. homogeneity, reversibility and isotropy, we will show that the physical laws thus
selected are particular algorithms known as cellular automata. Further assumptions regarding
maximal simplicity of the algorithm lead to two cellular automata only, that in a suitable regime
can be described by Weyl's differential equations, lying at the basis of the dynamics of relativistic
quantum fields. We will finally discuss how the same cellular automaton can give rise to both Fermionic
field dynamics and to Maxwell's equations, that rule the dynamics of the electromagnetic field.
We will conclude reviewing the discussion of the relativity principle, that must be suitably adapted
to the scenario where space-time is not an elementary notion, through the definition of a change
of inertial reference frame, and whose formulation leads to the recovery of the symmetry of Minkowski
space-time, identified with Poincar\'e's group. Space-time thus emerges as one of the manifestations
of physical laws, rather than the background where they occur, and its features are determined by
the dynamics of systems, necessarily equipped with differential equations that express it. In
brief, there is no space-time unless an evolution rule requires it.

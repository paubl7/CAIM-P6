A solvable model of a periodically-driven trapped mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates, consisting
of $N_1$ interacting bosons of mass $m_1$ driven by a force of amplitude $f_{L,1}$ and $N_2$ interacting
bosons of mass $m_2$ driven by a force of amplitude $f_{L,2}$, is presented. The model generalizes
the harmonic-interaction model for mixtures to the time-dependent domain. The resulting many-particle
ground Floquet wavefunction and quasienergy, as well as the time-dependent densities and reduced
density matrices, are prescribed explicitly and analyzed at the many-body and mean-field levels
of theory for finite systems and at the limit of an infinite number of particles. We prove that the
time-dependent densities per particle are given at the limit of an infinite number of particles
by their respective mean-field quantities, and that the time-dependent reduced one-particle
and two-particle density matrices per particle of the driven mixture are $100\%$ condensed. Interestingly,
the quasienergy per particle {\it does not} coincide with the mean-field value at this limit, unless
the relative center-of-mass coordinate of the two Bose-Einstein condensates is not activated
by the driving forces $f_{L,1}$ and $f_{L,2}$. As an application, we investigate the imprinting
of angular momentum and its fluctuations when steering a Bose-Einstein condensate by an interacting
bosonic impurity, and the resulting modes of rotations. Whereas the expectation values per particle
of the angular-momentum operator for the many-body and mean-field solutions coincide at the limit
of an infinite number of particles, the respective fluctuations can differ substantially. The
results are analyzed in terms of the transformation properties of the angular-momentum operator
under translations and boosts and the interactions between the particles. Implications are briefly
discussed.

Topological quantum optical states in one-dimensional (1D) quasiperiodic cold atomic chains
are studied in this work. We propose that by introducing incommensurate modulations on the interatomic
distances of 1D periodic atomic chains, the off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model can
be mimicked, although the crucial difference is the existence of long-range dipole-dipole interactions.
The discrete band structures with respect to the modulation phase, which plays the role of a dimension
extension parameter, are calculated for finite chains beyond the nearest-neighbor approximation.
It is found that the present system indeed supports nontrivial topological states localized over
the boundaries. Despite the presence of long-range dipole-dipole interactions that leads to an
asymmetric band structure, it is demonstrated that this system inherits the topological properties
of two-dimensional integer quantum Hall systems. The spectral position, for both real and imaginary
frequencies, and number of these topologically protected edge states are still governed by the
gap-labeling theorem and characterized by the topological invariant, namely, the (first) Chern
number, indicating the validity of bulk-boundary correspondence. Due to the fractal spectrum
arising from the quasiperiodicity in a substantially wide range of system parameters, our system
provides a large number of topological gaps and optical states readily for practical use. It is also
revealed that a substantial proportion of the topological edge states are highly subradiant with
extremely low decay rates, which therefore offer an appealing route for controlling the emission
of external quantum emitters and achieving high-fidelity quantum state storage.

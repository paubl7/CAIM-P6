This work attempts a fundamental formulation of physics based on probabilities. The basic assumptions
are simple: One world exists. Humans can understand its properties by formulating laws based on
probabilities. Our probabilistic setting only employs the notions of a probability distribution,
observables and their expectation values, which are computed according to the classical statistical
rule. Time is an ordering structure among observables. Understanding the probabilistic laws enables
humans to make predictions for future events. Also space, spacetime and geometry emerge as structures
among observables. Within the classical statistical system the time structure induces the concepts
of wave functions, density matrices, non-commuting operators and many other aspects of quantum
physics. The classical density matrix encodes the probabilistic information of a time-local subsystem.
Subsystems are typically correlated with their environment, offering a much richer structure
than discussed commonly. We pay particular attention to subsystems with incomplete statistics
and probabilistic observables. Quantum systems are particular time-local subsystems that follow
an unitary evolution law. All laws of quantum mechanics are derived from the basic law for expectation
values in classical statistics. In particular, we discuss entangled quantum systems in terms of
classical probability distributions. In our approach quantum field theories have to be described
by an overall probability distribution for the whole Universe for all times. The fundamental functional
integral for quantum field theories should define a probability distribution, underlying the
functional integral with Minkowski signature. While this work remains in the context of theoretical
physics, the concepts developed here apply to a wide area of science.

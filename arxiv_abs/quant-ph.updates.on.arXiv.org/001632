A general consensus is--two causally disconnected Unruh-DeWitt detectors, depending upon their
motions, can be entangled through interaction with a common background field. Here we investigate
the effects of field temperature $T^{(f)}$ on entanglement harvesting between two uniformly accelerated
detectors. In case of their parallel motion, the thermal nature of fields does not produce any entanglement,
and therefore, the outcome is the same as the non-thermal situation. On the contrary, background
temperature $T^{(f)}$ does affect entanglement harvesting when the detectors are in anti-parallel
motion, i.e., one detector is in the right Rindler wedge (detector $A$), and the other one is in the
left Rindler wedge (detector $B$). While for $T^{(f)}=0$ entanglement harvesting is possible
for all acceleration values $a_A$ of detector $A$, in the presence of temperature, the situation
is quite different. In the latter case, entanglement harvesting is possible only within a narrow
range of $a_A$. For $(1+1)$ dimensions, the range starts from a certain value and extends to infinity,
and as we increase $T^{(f)}$, the required value of $a_A$ for starting entanglement increases.
Moreover, above a critical value, $a_A=a_c$ harvesting increases as we increase $T^{(f)}$, which
is just opposite for accelerations below it. This feature does not change even if both the detectors
move with equal acceleration. In $(1+3)$ dimensions, we found many critical values of $a_A$ when
the detectors moved with different accelerations. Besides, there exist several discrete ranges
of $a_A$, contrary to the single range in $(1+1)$ dimensions, for certain fixed values of $T^{(f)}$
within which the entanglement harvesting is possible. Interestingly, for detectors moving with
equal acceleration, instead of multiple critical values, one has a single critical point, with
nature quite similar to $(1+1)$ dimensional results.

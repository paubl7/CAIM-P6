Quantum two-level systems (TLSs) are present in the materials of qubits and are considered defects
because they limit qubit coherence. For superconducting qubits, the quintessential Josephson
junction barrier is made of amorphous alumina, which hosts TLSs. However, TLSs are not understood
generally, either structurally or in atomic composition, such that better characterization is
needed. In this study, we greatly extend the quantitative data available on TLSs by using an Electrical-Bridge
Quantum Defect Sensor (EBQuDS) to characterize two alumina types: gamma polycrystalline Al2O3
and amorphous a-AlOx. The EBQuDS is a circuit that electrically tunes individual TLSs close enough
to cavity resonance to form a cavity quantum electrodynamical (cQED) system. The sensor furthermore
uses the dc-electric field dependence to extract the dipole moments (sizes) of individual TLSs.
We find a clear difference in the dipole sizes from the film types, indicating a difference in TLS
structures. A large sample of about 400 individual TLSs are analyzed from the polycrystalline film
type. Their dipole along the growth direction, pz, have a mean value of 2.6(1) Debye (= 0.54 e Angstrom)
and a standard deviation of 1.6(1) Debye. Data from two devices fit well to a single Gaussian distribution,
consistent with a single defect type. The dipole analysis allows a comparison to recent structural
models simulated by Density Functional Theory (DFT). We find that polycrystalline TLSs are consistent
with hydrogen-based defect models. In contrast, about 200 individual TLSs are analyzed from amorphous
films. Of these, 11% of the TLSs have a dipole moment larger than 8 Debye. This is quantitatively consistent
with a delocalized oxygen model, but contrasts polycrystalline moment data and known hydrogen
models.

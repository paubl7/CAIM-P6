With quantum computers promising advantages even in the near-term NISQ era, there is a lively community
that develops software and toolkits for the design of corresponding quantum circuits. Although
the underlying problems are different, expertise from the design automation community, which
developed sophisticated design solutions for the conventional realm in the past decades, can help
here. In this respect, decision diagrams provide a promising foundation for tackling many design
tasks such as simulation, synthesis, and verification of quantum circuits. However, users of the
corresponding tools often do not have a proper background or an intuition about how these methods
based on decision diagrams work and what their strengths and limits are. In this work, we first review
the concepts of how decision diagrams can be employed, e.g., for the simulation and verification
of quantum circuits. Afterwards, in an effort to make decision diagrams for quantum computing more
accessible, we then present a visualization tool for quantum decision diagrams, which allows users
to explore the behavior of decision diagrams in the design tasks mentioned above. Finally, we present
decision diagram-based tools for simulation and verification of quantum circuits using the methods
discussed above as part of the open-source JKQ quantum toolset---a set of tools for quantum computing
developed at the Johannes Kepler University (JKU) Linz and released under the MIT license. More
information about the corresponding tools is available at https://github.com/iic-jku/. By this,
we provide an introduction of the concepts and tools for potential users who would like to work with
them as well as potential developers aiming to extend them.

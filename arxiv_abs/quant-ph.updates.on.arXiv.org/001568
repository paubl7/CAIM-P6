The non-dissipative non-linearity of a Josephson junction converts macroscopic superconducting
circuits into artificial atoms, enabling some of the best controlled quantum bits (qubits) today.
Three fundamental types of superconducting qubits are known, each reflecting a distinct behavior
of quantum fluctuations in a Cooper pair condensate: single charge tunneling (charge qubit), single
flux tunneling (flux qubit), and phase oscillations (phase qubit). Yet, the dual nature of charge
and flux suggests that circuit atoms must come in pairs. Here we introduce the missing one, named
"blochnium". It exploits a coherent insulating response of a single Josephson junction that emerges
from the extension of phase fluctuations beyond the $2\pi$-interval. Evidence for such effect
was found in an out-of-equilibrium dc-transport through junctions connected to high-impedance
leads, although a full consensus is absent to date. We shunt a weak junction with an exceptionally
high-value inductance -- the key technological innovation behind our experiment -- and measure
the rf-excitation spectrum as a function of external magnetic flux through the resulting loop.
The junction's insulating character manifests by the vanishing flux-sensitivity of the qubit
transition between the ground and the first excited states, which nevertheless rapidly recovers
for transitions to higher energy states. The spectrum agrees with a duality mapping of blochnium
onto transmon, which replaces the external flux by the offset charge and introduces a new collective
quasicharge variable in place of the superconducting phase. Our result unlocks the door to an unexplored
regime of macroscopic quantum dynamics in ultrahigh-impedance circuits, which may have applications
to quantum computing and quantum metrology of direct current.

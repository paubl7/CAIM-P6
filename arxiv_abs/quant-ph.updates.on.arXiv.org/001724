What does it take for real-deterministic c-valued (i.e., classical, commuting) variables to comply
with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle? Here, we construct a class of real-deterministic c-valued
variables out of the weak values obtained via a non-perturbing weak measurement of quantum operators
with a post-selection over a complete set of state vectors basis, which always satisfies the Kennard-Robertson-Schr\"odinger
uncertainty relation. First, we introduce an auxiliary global random variable and couple it to
the imaginary part of the weak value to transform the incompatibility between the quantum operator
and the basis into the fluctuation of an `error term', and then superimpose it onto the real-part
of the weak value. We show that this class of ``c-valued physical quantities'' provides a real-deterministic
contextual hidden variable model for the quantum expectation value of a certain class of operators.
We then show that the Schr\"odinger and the Kennard-Robertson lower bounds can be obtained separately
by imposing the classical uncertainty relation to the c-valued physical quantities associated
with a pair of Hermitian operators. Within the representation, the complementarity between two
incompatible quantum observables manifests the absence of a basis wherein the error terms of the
associated two c-valued physical quantities simultaneously vanish. Furthermore, quantum uncertainty
relation is captured by a specific irreducible epistemic restriction, foreign in classical mechanics,
constraining the allowed form of the joint distribution of the two c-valued physical quantities.
We then suggest an epistemic interpretation of the two terms decomposing the c-valued physical
quantity as the optimal estimate under the epistemic restriction and the associated estimation
error, and discuss the classical limit.

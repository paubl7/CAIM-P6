Quantum machine learning (QML) can complement the growing trend of using learned models for a myriad
of classification tasks, from image recognition to natural speech processing. A quantum advantage
arises due to the intractability of quantum operations on a classical computer. Many datasets used
in machine learning are crowd sourced or contain some private information. To the best of our knowledge,
no current QML models are equipped with privacy-preserving features, which raises concerns as
it is paramount that models do not expose sensitive information. Thus, privacy-preserving algorithms
need to be implemented with QML. One solution is to make the machine learning algorithm differentially
private, meaning the effect of a single data point on the training dataset is minimized. Differentially
private machine learning models have been investigated, but differential privacy has yet to be
studied in the context of QML. In this study, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical model that is
trained to preserve privacy using differentially private optimization algorithm. This marks
the first proof-of-principle demonstration of privacy-preserving QML. The experiments demonstrate
that differentially private QML can protect user-sensitive information without diminishing
model accuracy. Although the quantum model is simulated and tested on a classical computer, it demonstrates
potential to be efficiently implemented on near-term quantum devices (noisy intermediate-scale
quantum [NISQ]). The approach's success is illustrated via the classification of spatially classed
two-dimensional datasets and a binary MNIST classification. This implementation of privacy-preserving
QML will ensure confidentiality and accurate learning on NISQ technology.

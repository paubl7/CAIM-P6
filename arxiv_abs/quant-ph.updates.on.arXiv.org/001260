The measurement of Cesium (Cs) 7D5/2 excited state's hyperfine splitting intervals and hyperfine-interaction
constants has been experimentally investigated based on ladder-type (852 nm + 698 nm) three-level
Cs system (6S1/2 - 6P3/2 - 7D5/2) with room-temperature Cs atomic vapor cell. By scanning the 698-nm
coupling laser's frequency, the Doppler-free high-resolution electromagnetically-induced
transparency (EIT) assisted double-resonance optical pumping (DROP) spectra have been demonstrated
via transmission enhancement of the locked 852-nm probe laser. The EIT-assisted DROP spectra are
employed to study the hyperfine splitting intervals for the Cs 7D5/2 excited state with a room-temperature
cesium atomic vapor cell, and the radio-frequency modulation sideband of a waveguide-type electro-optic
phase modulator(EOPM) is introduced for frequency calibration to improve the accuracy of frequency
interval measurement. The existence of EIT makes the DROP spectral linewidth much narrower, and
it is very helpful to improve the spectroscopic resolution significantly. Benefiting from the
higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and much better resolution of the EIT-assisted DROP spectra,
the hyperfine splitting intervals between the hyperfine folds of (F" = 6), (F" = 5), and (F" = 4) of
cesium 7D5/2 state (HFS6"-5" = -10.60(0.17) MHz and HFS5"-4" = -8.54(0.15) MHz) have been measured,
and therefore the magnetic-dipole hyperfine-interaction constant (A = -1.70(0.03) MHz) and the
electric-quadrupole hyperfine-interaction constant (B = -0.77(0.58) MHz) have been derived
for the Cs 7D5/2 state. These constants have important reference value for the improvement of precise
measurement and determination of basic physical constants.

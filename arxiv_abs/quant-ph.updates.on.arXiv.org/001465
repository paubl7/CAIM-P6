Topological insulators, along with Chern insulators and Quantum Hall insulator phases, are considered
as paradigms for symmetry protected topological phases of matter. This article reports the experimental
realization of the time-reversal invariant helical edge-modes in bilayer graphene/monolayer
WSe$_2$-based heterostructures -- a phase generally considered as a precursor to the field of generic
topological insulators. Our observation of this elusive phase depended crucially on our ability
to create mesoscopic devices comprising both a moir\'e superlattice potential and strong spin-orbit
coupling; this resulted in materials whose electronic band structure could be tuned from trivial
to topological by an external displacement field. We find that the topological phase is characterized
by a bulk bandgap and by helical edge-modes with electrical conductance quantized exactly to $2e^2/h$
in zero external magnetic field. We put the helical edge-modes on firm grounds through supporting
experiments, including the verification of predictions of the Landauer-B$\mathrm{\ddot{u}}$ttiker
model for quantum transport in multi-terminal mesoscopic devices. Our non-local transport properties
measurements show that the helical edge-modes are dissipationless and equilibrate at the contact
probes. We achieved the tunability of the different topological phases with electric and magnetic
fields, which allowed us to achieve topological phase transitions between trivial and multiple,
distinct topological phases. We also present results of a theoretical study of a realistic model
which, in addition to replicating our experimental results, explains the origin of the topological
insulating bulk and helical edge-modes. Our experimental and theoretical results establish a
viable route to realizing the time-reversal invariant $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase of matter.

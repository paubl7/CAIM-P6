In the context of Frenkel exciton dynamics in aggregated molecules the polaron transformation
technique facilitates a treatment where diagonal elements attributed to electronic excited-state
populations are decoupled from fluctuations associated with vibrational degrees-of-freedom.
In this article we describe for the first time how the polaron transformation can be applied in the
context of the "Hierarchical Equations of Motion" (HEOM) technique for treatment of open quantum
systems with all vibrational components attributed to an environment. By using a generating function
approach to introduce a shift in the excited state potential energy surface, we derive hierarchical
equations for polaron transformation in analogy to those for time propagation. We demonstrate
the applicability of the developed approach by calculating the dynamics of underdamped and overdamped
oscillators coupled to electronic excitation of a monomer without and with previous polaron transformation
and study the dynamics of the expectation value of the respective vibrational coordinates. Furthermore,
we investigate the dynamics of a dimer with a barrier comparable to the thermal energy between the
minima of the lower excitonic potential energy surface. It turns out that the assumption of localization
at the monomer unit with energetically higher potential minimum, introduced via polaron transformation,
has a substantial influence on the transfer dynamics. Here, it makes a clear difference whether
the polaron transformation is performed in the local or exciton basis. This reflects the fact that
the polaron transformation only accounts for equilibration of the vibrational, but not of the excitonic
dynamics. We sketch an approach to compensate this shortcoming in view of obtaining an initial state
for the calculation of emission spectra of molecular aggregates.

The absolute/relative debate on the nature of space and time is ongoing for thousands of years. Here
we attempt to investigate space and time from the information theoretic point of view to understand
spatial and temporal correlations under the relative assumption. Correlations, as a measure of
relationship between two quantities, do not distinguish space and time in classical probability
theory; quantum correlations in space are well-studied but temporal correlations are not well
understood. The thesis investigates quantum correlations in space-time, by treating temporal
correlations equally in form as spatial correlations and unifying quantum correlations in space
and time. In particular, we follow the pseudo-density matrix formalism in which quantum states
in spacetime are properly defined by correlations from measurements. We first review classical
correlations, quantum correlations in space and time, to motivate the pseudo-density matrix formalism
in finite dimensions. Next we generalise the pseudo-density matrix formulation to the Gaussian
case, general continuous variables via Wigner representations, and general measurement processes
like weak measurements. Then we compare the pseudo-density matrix formalism with other spacetime
formulations: indefinite causal structures, consistent histories, generalised non-local games,
out-of-time-order correlation functions, and path integrals. We argue that in non-relativistic
quantum mechanics, different spacetime formulations are closely related via quantum correlations,
except path integrals. Finally, we apply the pseudo-density matrix formulation to time crystals.
By defining time crystals as long-range order in time, we analyse continuous and discrete time translation
symmetry as well as discuss the existence of time crystals from an algebraic point of view. Finally,
we summarise our work and provide the outlook for future directions.

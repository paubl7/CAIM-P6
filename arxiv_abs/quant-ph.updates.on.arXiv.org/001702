Port-based teleportation (PBT) is a protocol of quantum teleportation in which a receiver does
not have to correct the transmitted state. Two spatially separated parties can teleport an unknown
quantum state only by exploiting joint measurements on shared $d-$dimensional maximally entangled
states (resource state) together with a state to be teleported and one way classical communication.
In this paper we analyse so called recycling protocol for deterministic PBT introduced earlier.
It was stated by other authors that such protocol allows in principle for exploiting the same resource
state in many rounds $k$ of PBT, arguing that the resource state does not degrade too much after each
round. In particular, there is a claim that the fidelity between ideal resource state and its real
version, each of them after one round of PBT, reaches asymptotically 1 when the number of shared entangled
pairs tends to infinity. The similar statement is claimed for $k$ uses of PBT, when the error accumulates
at most linearly in $k$. Here, considering original setup for the recycling protocol, we disprove
these claims. We show the resource state is heavily distorted after even one round of PBT with fidelity
not exceeding the value $1/d$. This bound was obtained by referring only to Schwarz inequality and
general properties of measurements exploited in the protocol. As additional results we present
explicit formula for the mentioned fidelity involving group-theoretic parameters describing
irreducible representations in the Schur-Weyl duality. The qubit case is discussed separately
resulting in compact expression for fidelity, depending only on the number of shared entangled
pairs. Additionally, we claim that fidelity of the recycling protocol is not quantity which judges
usefulness of the state for PBT definitely.

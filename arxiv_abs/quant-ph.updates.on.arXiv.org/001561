In this work we present a derivation of Dirac's equation in a curved space-time starting from a Weyl-invariant
action principle in 4+K dimensions. The Weyl invariance of Dirac's equation (and of Quantum Mechanics
in general) is made possible by observing that the difference between the Weyl and the Riemann scalar
curvatures in a metric space is coincident with Bohm's Quantum potential. This circumstance allows
a completely geometrical formulation of Quantum Mechanics, the Conformal Quantum Geometrodynamics
(CQG), which was proved to be useful, for example, to clarify some aspects of the quantum paradoxes
and to simplify the demonstration of difficult theorems as the Spin-Statistics connection. The
present work extends our previous derivation of Dirac's equation from the flat Minkowski space-time
to a general curved space-time. Charge and the e.m. fields are introduced by adding extra-coordinates
and then gauging the associated group symmetry. The resulting Dirac's equation yields naturally
to the correct gyromagnetic ratio $g_e=2$ for the electron, but differs from the one derived in the
Standard Quantum Mechanics (SQM) in two respects. First, the coupling with the space-time Riemann
scalar curvature is found to be about 1/4 in the CQG instead of 1/2 as in the SQM and, second, in the CQG
result two very small additional terms appear as scalar potentials acting on the particle. One depends
on the derivatives of the e.m. field tensor and the other is the scalar Kretschmann term $R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$.
Both terms, not present in the SQM, become appreciable only at distances of the order of the electron
Compton length or less. The Kretschmann term, in particular, is the only one surviving in an external
gravitational field obeying Einstein's equations in vacuum. These small differences render the
CQG theory confutable by very accurate experiments, at least in principle.

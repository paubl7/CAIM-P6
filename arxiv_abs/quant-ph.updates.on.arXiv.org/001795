The first two decades of the 21st century have witnessed remarkable progress in harnessing the power
of quantum mechanics, on-chip, enabled by the development in epitaxial semiconductor nanoscience
with proof-of-principle demonstrations -- many tour-de force -- of quantum functionalities such
as entanglement and teleportation amongst photon and matter qubits -- quintessential quantum
phenomena that underpin the development of quantum technologies. A basic hindrance to such development
however has been the absence of a platform of on-demand single photon sources with adequate spectral
characteristics and arranged in spatially regular arrays necessary for their incorporation in
surrounding light manipulation units to enable quantum networks. Here we report on the first spatially-ordered,
scalable platform of deterministic, bright, spectrally highly uniform, pure, and indistinguishable
single photon sources (SPSs). At 19.5K, and without Purcell enhancement, these SPSs exhibit emission
purity ~99.2% and two-photon interference (TPI) indistinguishability ~57%. Oscillation behavior
of the photon emission indicates that photons originate from a coherent superposition of two excitonic
states, revealing effectively a three-level electronic structure which can be exploited as potential
two-frequency qubit generating energy entangled photons for teleportation. Time-dependent
two photon interference (HOM interferometry) coincidence counts g(2)({\tau}) near {\tau}=0
shows effectively zero count which, analyzed using the three-level model, reveals a highly encouraging
dephasing time of ~0.58ns at ~20K. Such SPS arrays in a planarized structure open the pathway to creating
interconnected quantum networks for application in communication, sensing, computing and more.

The canonical ensemble plays a crucial role in statistical mechanics in and out of equilibrium.
For example, the standard derivation of the fluctuation theorem relies on the assumption that the
initial state of the heat bath is the canonical ensemble. On the other hand, the recent progress in
the foundation of statistical mechanics has revealed that a thermal equilibrium state is not necessarily
described by the canonical ensemble but can be a quantum pure state or even a single energy eigenstate,
as formulated by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Then, a question raised is how
these two pictures, the canonical ensemble and a single energy eigenstate as a thermal equilibrium
state, are compatible in the fluctuation theorem. In this paper, we theoretically and numerically
show that the fluctuation theorem holds in both of the long and short-time regimes, even when the
initial state of the bath is a single energy eigenstate of a many-body system. Our proof of the fluctuation
theorem in the long-time regime is based on the ETH, while it was previously shown in the short-time
regime on the basis of the Lieb-Robinson bound and the ETH [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 100601 (2017)].
The proofs for these time regimes are theoretically independent and complementary, implying the
fluctuation theorem in the entire time domain. We also perform a systematic numerical simulation
of hard-core bosons by exact diagonalization and verify the fluctuation theorem in both of the time
regimes by focusing on the finite-size scaling. Our results contribute to the understanding of
the mechanism that the fluctuation theorem emerges from unitary dynamics of quantum many-body
systems, and can be tested by experiments with, e.g., ultracold atoms.

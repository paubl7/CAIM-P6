Using M-theory in physics, Cho, Gang, and Kim (JHEP 2020, 115 (2020) ) recently outlined a program
that connects two parallel subjects of three dimensional manifolds, namely, geometric topology
and quantum topology. They suggest that classical topological invariants such as Chern-Simons
invariants of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-flat connections and adjoint Reidemeister torsions
of a three manifold can be packaged together to produce a $(2+1)$-topological quantum field theory,
which is essentially equivalent to a modular tensor category. It is further conjectured that every
modular tensor category can be obtained from a three manifold and a semi-simple Lie group. In this
paper, we study this program mathematically, and provide strong support for the feasibility of
such a program. The program produces an algorithm to generate the potential modular $T$-matrix
and the quantum dimensions of a candidate modular data. The modular $S$-matrix follows from essentially
a trial-and-error procedure. We find modular tensor categories that realize candidate modular
data constructed from Seifert fibered spaces and torus bundles over the circle that reveal many
subtleties in the program. We make a number of improvements to the program based on our computations.
Our main result is a mathematical construction of a premodular category from each Seifert fibered
space with three singular fibers and a family of torus bundles over the circle with Thurston SOL geometry.
The premodular categories from Seifert fibered spaces are related to Temperley-Lieb-Jones categories
and the ones from torus bundles over the circle are related to metaplectic categories. We conjecture
that a resulting premodular category is modular if and only if the three manifold is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-homology
sphere and condensation of bosons in premodular categories leads to either modular or super-modular
categories.

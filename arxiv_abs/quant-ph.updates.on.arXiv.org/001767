Quantum channels, which break entanglement, incompatibility, or nonlocality, are not useful
for entanglement-based, one-sided device-independent, or device-independent quantum information
processing, respectively. Here, we show that such breaking channels are related to certain temporal
quantum correlations, i.e., temporal separability, channel unsteerability, temporal unsteerability,
and macrorealism. More specifically, we first define the steerability-breaking channel, which
is conceptually similar to the entanglement and nonlocality-breaking channels and prove that
it is identical to the incompatibility-breaking channel. Similar to the hierarchy relations of
the temporal and spatial quantum correlations, the hierarchy of non-breaking channels is discussed.
We then introduce the concept of the channels which break temporal correlations, explain how they
are related to the standard breaking channels, and prove the following results: (1) A certain measure
of temporal nonseparability can be used to quantify a non-entanglement-breaking channel in the
sense that the measure is a memory monotone under the framework of the resource theory of the quantum
memory. (2) A non-steerability-breaking channel can be certified with channel steering because
the steerability-breaking channel is equivalent to the incompatibility-breaking channel. (3)
The temporal steerability and non-macrorealism can, respectively, distinguish the steerability-breaking
and the nonlocality-breaking unital channel from their corresponding non-breaking channels.
Finally, a two-dimensional depolarizing channel is experimentally implemented as a proof-of-principle
example to compare the temporal quantum correlations with non-breaking channels.

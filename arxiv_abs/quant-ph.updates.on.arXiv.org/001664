We investigate the time evolution and asymptotic behavior of a system of two two-level atoms (qubits)
interacting off-resonance with a single mode radiation field. The two atoms are coupled to each
other through dipole-dipole as well as Ising interactions. An exact analytic solution for the system
dynamics that spans the entire phase space is provided. We focus on initial states that cause the
system to evolve to entanglement sudden death (ESD) between the two atoms. We find that combining
the Ising and dipole-dipole interactions is very powerful in controlling the entanglement dynamics
and ESD compared with either one of them separately. Their effects on eliminating ESD may add up constructively
or destructively depending on the type of Ising interaction (Ferromagnetic or anti-Ferromagnetic),
the detuning parameter value, and the initial state of the system. The asymptotic behavior of the
ESD is found to depend substantially on the initial state of the system, where ESD can be entirely
eliminated by tuning the system parameters except in the case of an initial correlated Bell state.
Interestingly, the entanglement, atomic population and quantum correlation between the two atoms
and the field synchronize and reach asymptotically quasi-steady dynamic states. Each one of them
ends up as a continuous irregular oscillation, where the collapse periods vanish, with a limited
amplitude and an approximately constant mean value that depend on the initial state and the system
parameters choice. This indicates an asymptotic continuous exchange of energy (and strong quantum
correlation) between the atoms and the field takes place, accompanied by diminished ESD for these
chosen setups of the system. This system can be realized in spin states of quantum dots or Rydberg
atoms in optical cavities, and superconducting or hybrid qubits in linear resonators.

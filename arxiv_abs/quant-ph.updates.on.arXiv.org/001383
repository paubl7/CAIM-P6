Quantum entanglement is a key resource for quantum computation and quantum communication \cite{Nielsen2010}.
Scaling to large quantum communication or computation networks further requires the deterministic
generation of multi-qubit entanglement \cite{Gottesman1999,Duan2001,Jiang2007}. The deterministic
entanglement of two remote qubits has recently been demonstrated with microwave photons \cite{Kurpiers2018,Axline2018,Campagne2018,Leung2019,Zhong2019},
optical photons \cite{Humphreys2018} and surface acoustic wave phonons \cite{Bienfait2019}.
However, the deterministic generation and transmission of multi-qubit entanglement has not been
demonstrated, primarily due to limited state transfer fidelities. Here, we report a quantum network
comprising two separate superconducting quantum nodes connected by a 1 meter-long superconducting
coaxial cable, where each node includes three interconnected qubits. By directly connecting the
coaxial cable to one qubit in each node, we can transfer quantum states between the nodes with a process
fidelity of $0.911\pm0.008$. Using the high-fidelity communication link, we can prepare a three-qubit
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state \cite{Greenberger1990,Neeley2010,Dicarlo2010}
in one node and deterministically transfer this state to the other node, with a transferred state
fidelity of $0.656\pm 0.014$. We further use this system to deterministically generate a two-node,
six-qubit GHZ state, globally distributed within the network, with a state fidelity of $0.722\pm0.021$.
The GHZ state fidelities are clearly above the threshold of $1/2$ for genuine multipartite entanglement
\cite{Guhne2010}, and show that this architecture can be used to coherently link together multiple
superconducting quantum processors, providing a modular approach for building large-scale quantum
computers \cite{Monroe2014,Chou2018}.

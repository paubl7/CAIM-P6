The HSSS quantum search process owns the dual character that it obeys both the unitary quantum dynamics
and the mathematical-logical principle of the unstructured search problem. It is essentially
different from a conventional quantum search algorithm. It is constructed with the duality-character
oracle operations of unstructured search problem. It consists of the two consecutive steps: (1)
the search-space dynamical reduction and (2) the dynamical quantum-state-difference amplification
(QUANSDAM). The QUANSDAM process is directly constructed with the SIC unitary propagators, while
the latter each are prepared with the basic SIC unitary operators. Here the preparation for the SIC
unitary propagators of a single-atom system is concretely carried out by starting from the basic
SIC unitary operators. The SIC unitary propagator of a quantum system may reflect the quantum symmetry
of the quantum system, while the basic SIC unitary operators may not. The quantum symmetry is considered
as the fundamental quantum-computing-speedup resource in the quantum-computing speedup theory.
The purpose for the preparation is ultimately to employ the quantum symmetry to speed up the QUANSDAM
process. The preparation is a solution-information transfer process. It is unitary and deterministic.
It obeys the information conservation law. In methodology it is based on the energy eigenfunction
expansion and the multiple-quantum operator algebra space. Furthermore, a general theory mainly
based on the Feynman path integration technique and also the energy eigenfunction expansion method
is established to treat theoretically and calculate a SIC unitary propagator of any quantum system
in the coordinate representation, which may be further used to construct theoretically an exponential
QUANSDAM process in future.

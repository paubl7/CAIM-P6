In a time-reversal invariant system, while the anomalous Hall effect identically vanishes in the
linear response regime due to the constraint of time-reversal symmetry on the distribution of Berry
curvature, a nonlinear Hall effect can emerge in the second-order response regime if the inversion
symmetry is broken to allow a nonzero Berry curvature dipole (BCD) on the Fermi surface. In this work,
we study the nonlinear Hall effect of the BCD origin in two-dimensional doped insulators and semimetals
belonging to the symmetry class AI which has spinless time-reversal symmetry. Despite that the
class AI does not host any strong topological insulator phase in two dimensions, we find that they
can still be classified as topologically obstructed insulators and trivial insulators if putting
certain constraint on the Hamiltonians. When the insulator gets closer to the phase boundary of
the two distinct phases, we find that the BCDs will become more prominent if the doping level is located
near the band edge. Moreover, when the insulator undergoes a phase transition between the two distinct
phases, we find that the BCDs will dramatically change their signs. For the semimetals without inversion
symmetry, we find that the BCDs will sharply reverse their signs when the doping level crosses the
Dirac points. With the shift of the locations of Dirac points in energy, the critical doping level
at which the BCDs sharply reverse their signs will accordingly change. Our study reveals that class
AI materials can also have interesting geometrical and topological properties, and remarkable
nonlinear Hall effect can also appear in this class of materials even though the spin-orbit coupling
is negligible. Our findings broaden the scope of materials to study the nonlinear Hall effect and
provide new perspectives for the application of this effect.

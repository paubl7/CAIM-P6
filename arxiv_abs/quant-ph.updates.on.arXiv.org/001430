We study the notion of zero-knowledge secure against quantum polynomial-time verifiers (referred
to as quantum zero-knowledge) in the concurrent composition setting. Despite being extensively
studied in the classical setting, concurrent composition in the quantum setting has hardly been
studied. We initiate a formal study of concurrent quantum zero-knowledge. Our results are as follows:
-Bounded Concurrent QZK for NP and QMA: Assuming post-quantum one-way functions, there exists
a quantum zero-knowledge proof system for NP in the bounded concurrent setting. In this setting,
we fix a priori the number of verifiers that can simultaneously interact with the prover. Under the
same assumption, we also show that there exists a quantum zero-knowledge proof system for QMA in
the bounded concurrency setting. -Quantum Proofs of Knowledge: Assuming statistical receiver-private
post-quantum oblivious transfer, there exists a bounded concurrent zero-knowledge proof system
for NP satisfying quantum proof of knowledge property. We then instantiate the oblivious transfer
protocol based on a new assumption, called learning with errors with cloning security. Our extraction
mechanism simultaneously allows for extraction probability to be negligibly close to acceptance
probability (extractability) and also ensures that the prover's state after extraction is statistically
close to the prover's state after interacting with the verifier (simulatability). The seminal
work of [Unruh EUROCRYPT'12], and all its followups, satisfied a weaker version of extractability
property and moreover, did not achieve simulatability. Our result yields a proof of quantum knowledge
system for QMA with better parameters than prior works.

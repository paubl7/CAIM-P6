We develop a possibilistic semantic for quantum phenomena in an operational perspective. This
semantic is based on a Chu duality between preparation processes and yes/no tests, the target space
being a three-valued set equipped with an informational interpretation. After having defined
the notion of states, we develop a precise axiomatic for the space of states. The 'information principle',
proposed as a building block for some quantum axiomatic program, is translated into our framework
to emphasize the quantum character of our description. This principle suffices to constrain the
space of states to be a locally-boolean qualitative domain. The subset of pure states is then characterized
within this domain structure. After having carefully precised the notions of properties and measurements,
we explore the notion of compatibility between measurements. The existence of minimally-disturbing
measurements is then emphasized as a key axiom to describe the space of yes/no tests. The conditions
of existence of such measurements is translated into a simple property on the space of states, and
an explicit formula for these measurements is given. Having reduced the space of yes/no tests to
this set of minimally-disturbing operations, our Chu space becomes bi-extensional. The space
of 'descriptions', associated to families of compatible measurements, inherits a structure of
coherence domain. A subset of properties corresponding to 'classical properties' is identified
and explored. Endly, the symmetries of the system are characterized as a general sub-class of Chu
morphisms. We prove that these symmetries preserve the class of minimally-disturbing measurements
and the orthogonality relation between states. Explicit expressions of these symmetries are identified
for a large class of them.

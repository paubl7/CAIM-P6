Gaussian states have played on important role in the physics of continuous-variable quantum systems.
They are appealing for the experimental ease with which they can be produced, and for their compact
and elegant mathematical description. Nevertheless, many proposed quantum technologies require
us to go beyond the realm of Gaussian states and introduce non-Gaussian elements. In this Tutorial,
we provide a roadmap for the physics of non-Gaussian quantum states. We introduce the phase-space
representations as a framework to describe the different properties of quantum states in continuous-variable
systems. We then use this framework in various ways to explore the structure of the state space. We
explain how non-Gaussian states can be characterised not only through the negative values of their
Wigner function, but also via other properties such as quantum non-Gaussianity and the related
stellar rank. For multimode systems, we are naturally confronted with the question of how non-Gaussian
properties behave with respect to quantum correlations. To answer this question, we first show
how non-Gaussian states can be created by performing measurements on a subset of modes in a Gaussian
state. Then, we highlight that these measured modes must be correlated via specific quantum correlations
to the remainder of the system to create quantum non-Gaussian or Wigner-negative states. On the
other hand, non-Gaussian operations are also shown to enhance or even create quantum correlations.
Finally, we will demonstrate that Wigner negativity is a requirement to violate Bell inequalities
and to achieve a quantum computational advantage. At the end of the Tutorial, we also provide an overview
of several experimental realisations of non-Gaussian quantum states in quantum optics and beyond.

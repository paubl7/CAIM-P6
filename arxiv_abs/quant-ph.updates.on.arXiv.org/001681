Optimization algorithms play a central role in chemistry since optimization is the computational
keystone of most molecular and electronic structure calculations. Herein, we introduce the iterative
power algorithm (IPA) for global optimization and a formal proof of convergence for both discrete
and continuous global search problems, which is essential for applications in chemistry such as
molecular geometry optimization. IPA implements the power iteration method in quantics tensor
train (QTT) representations. Analogous to the imaginary time propagation method with infinite
mass, IPA starts with an initial probability distribution and iteratively applies the recurrence
relation $\rho_{k+1}({\bf x})=U({\bf x})\rho_k({\bf x})/\|U\rho_k\|_{L^1}$, where $U({\bf
x})=e^{-V({\bf x})}$ is defined in terms of the potential energy surface (PES) $V({\bf x})$. Upon
convergence, the probability distribution becomes a delta function, so the global minimum can
be obtained as the position expectation value. QTT representations are generated by fast adaptive
interpolation of multidimensional arrays to bypass the curse of dimensionality and the need to
evaluate $V({\bf x})$ for all possible ${\bf x}$. We illustrate the capabilities of IPA for global
search optimization of two multidimensional PESs, including a differentiable model PES of a DNA
chain and a discrete non-differentiable PES, $V(p)=\text{mod}(N,p)$, that resolves the prime
factors of an integer $N$, with $p$ in the space of prime numbers folded as a $d$-dimensional $2_1
\times 2_2 \times \cdots \times 2_d$ tensor. We find that IPA resolves multiple degenerate global
minima even when separated by large energy barriers in the highly rugged landscape of the potentials.
Therefore, IPA should be of great interest for a wide range of other optimization problems ubiquitous
in molecular and electronic structure calculations.

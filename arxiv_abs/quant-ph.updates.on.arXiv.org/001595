The qubit-mapping problem aims to assign qubits from a quantum circuit to a realistic NISQ device
in order to maximize limited resources. Many algorithmic solutions for the qubit-mapping problem
have been introduced, but much work remains in order to evaluate the effectiveness of a qubit-mapping
algorithm with respect to mapping a circuit to devices while taking into account the noise characteristics
of the device. In this work, we make progress on this question. Firstly, we introduce a noise-aware
heuristic mapping algorithm which fares well when compared to brute-force and trivial mapping
solutions for several benchmarks. This comparison serves to provide effective upper and lower
bounds for our heuristic mapper in terms of an algorithm's success rate. Subsequently, we analyze
how the performance of the mapping algorithm is affected by the characteristics of the interaction
graph, which represents the interactions of qubits in a quantum circuit. We observe that as interaction-graph
edges are added to benchmarks in either depth-first or breadth-first fashion, our heuristic algorithm's
calculated success rate varies significantly, implying that both the amount of interaction-graph
vertex degree and the distribution of edges in a quantum circuit's interaction graph play a significant
role in the calculated success rate when our greedy heuristic maps to a quantum device's coupling
graph. Lastly, we discovered that our heuristic algorithm provides substantial benefits over
the trivial solution when mapping quantum circuits to QPUs, provided that less than approximately
75\% of the QPU is occupied. Lastly, as the size of the quantum processor in our simulation grows,
so do the purported benefits from utilizing our heuristic mapper. This work takes the first steps
towards the characterization of quantum algorithms with respect to efficient qubit-mapping solutions
in NISQ-era devices.

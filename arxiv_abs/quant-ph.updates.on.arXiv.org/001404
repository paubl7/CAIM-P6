In this work we consider a superradiant phase transition problem for the Dicke-Ising model, which
generalizes the Dicke and Ising models for annealed complex networks presuming spin-spin interaction.
The model accounts the interaction between a spin (two-level) system and external classical (magnetic)
and quantized (transverse) fields. We examine regular, random, and scale-free network structures
characterized by the delta-function, random (Poisson), and power-law exponent degree distributions,
respectively. To describe paramagnetic (PM) - ferromagnetic (FM) and superradiant (SR) phase
transitions we introduce two order parameters: the total weighted spin z-component and the normalized
transverse field amplitude, which correspond to the spontaneous magnetization in z and x directions,
respectively. Due to the interplay between the spin interaction and the finite size effects in the
networks we first elucidate novel features of the SR state in the presence of the PM-FM phase transition.
We reveal that the critical temperature of the SR phase transition grows monotonically from some
certain value that corresponds to the critical number of nodes. For the scale-free networks we find
that this critical temperature rises with the degree exponent increase accompanied both by establishing
spontaneous magnetization in a quantum transverse field and vanishing of the collective spin component
in z direction. In addition, we establish the conditions for the network parameters to obtain a quantum
phase transition in the spin system when the critical temperature approaches zero. The fundamental
features, which involve critical values of the classical and quantum field parameters, are discussed
for the occurrence of the superradiance phase in this limit.

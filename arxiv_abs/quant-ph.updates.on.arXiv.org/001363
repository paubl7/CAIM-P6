We study a three-fold variant of the hypergraph product code construction, differing from the standard
homological product of three classical codes. When instantiated with 3 classical LDPC codes, this
"XYZ product" yields a non CSS quantum LDPC code which might display a large minimum distance. The
simplest instance of this construction, corresponding to the product of 3 repetition codes, is
a non CSS variant of the 3-dimensional toric code known as the Chamon code. The general construction
was introduced in Maurice's PhD thesis, but has remained poorly understood so far. The reason is
that while hypergraph product codes can be analyzed with combinatorial tools, the XYZ product codes
depend crucially on the algebraic properties of the parity-check matrices of the three classical
codes, making their analysis much more involved. Our main motivation for studying XYZ product codes
is that the natural representatives of logical operators are two-dimensional objects. This contrasts
with standard hypergraph product codes in 3 dimensions which always admit one-dimensional logical
operators. In particular, specific instances of XYZ product codes might display a minimum distance
as large as $\Theta(N^{2/3})$ which would beat the current record for the minimum distance of quantum
LDPC codes held by fiber bundle codes. While we do not prove this result here, we obtain the dimension
of a large class of XYZ product codes, and when restricting to codes with dimension 1, we reduce the
problem of computing the minimum distance to a more elementary combinatorial problem involving
binary 3-tensors. We also discuss in detail some families of XYZ product codes in three dimensions
with local interaction. Some of these codes seem to share properties with Haah's cubic codes and
might be interesting candidates for self-correcting quantum memories with a logarithmic energy
barrier.

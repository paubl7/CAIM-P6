Quantum states of light can enable sensing configurations with sensitivities beyond the shot-noise
limit (SNL). In order to better take advantage of available quantum resources and obtain the maximum
possible sensitivity, it is necessary to determine fundamental sensitivity limits for different
possible configurations for a given sensing system. Here, due to their wide applicability, we focus
on optical resonance sensors, which detect a change in a parameter of interest through a resonance
shift. We compare their fundamental sensitivity limits set by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB)
based on the estimation of changes in transmission or phase of a probing bright two-mode squeezed
state (bTMSS) of light. We show that the fundamental sensitivity results from an interplay between
the QCRB and the transfer function of the system. As a result, for a resonance sensor with a Lorentzian
lineshape a phase-based scheme outperforms a transmission-based one for most of the parameter
space; however, this is not the case for lineshapes with steeper slopes, such as higher order Butterworth
lineshapes. Furthermore, such an interplay results in conditions under which the phase-based
scheme provides a higher sensitivity than the transmission-based one but a smaller degree of quantum
enhancement. We also study the effect of losses external to the sensor on the degree of quantum enhancement
and show that for certain conditions probing with a classical state can provide a higher sensitivity
than probing with a bTMSS. Finally, we discuss detection schemes, namely optimized intensity-difference
and optimized homodyne detection, that can achieve the fundamental sensitivity limits even in
the presence of external losses.

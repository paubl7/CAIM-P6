Most material properties of great physical interest are directly related to nuclear dynamics,
e.g. the ionic thermal conductivity, Raman/IR vibrational spectra, inelastic X-ray, and Neutron
scattering. A theory able to compute from first principles these properties, fully accounting
for the quantum nature of the nuclei and the anharmonicity in the nuclear energy landscape that can
be implemented in systems with hundreds of atoms is missing. Here, we derive an approximated theory
for the quantum time evolution of lattice vibrations at finite temperature. This theory introduces
the time dynamics in the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) and shares with the static
case the same computational cost. It is nonempirical, as pure states evolve according to the Dirac
least action principle and the dynamics of the thermal ensemble conserves both energy and entropy.
The static SCHA is recovered as a stationary solution of the dynamical equations. We apply perturbation
theory around the static SCHA solution and derive an algorithm to compute efficiently quantum dynamical
correlation functions. Thanks to this new algorithm, we have access to the response function of
any general external time-dependent perturbation, enabling the simulation of phonon spectra
without following any perturbative expansion of the nuclear potential or empirical methods. We
benchmark the method on the IR and Raman spectroscopy of high-pressure hydrogen phase III, with
a simulation cell of 96 atoms. Our work also explores the nonlinear regime of the dynamical nuclear
motion, providing a paradigm to simulate the interaction with intense or multiple probes, as in
pump-probe spectroscopy, or chemical reactions involving light atoms, as the proton transfer
in biomolecules.

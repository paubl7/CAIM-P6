Topological matter and topological optics have been studied in many systems, with promising applications
in materials science and photonics technology. These advances motivate the study of the interaction
between topological matter and light, as well as topological protection in light-matter interactions.
In this work, we study a waveguide-interfaced topological atom array. The light-matter interaction
is nontrivially modified by topology, yielding novel optical phenomena. We find topology-enhanced
photon absorption from the waveguide for large Purcell factor, i.e., $\Gamma/\Gamma_0\gg 1$,
where $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma_0$ are the atomic decays to waveguide and environment, respectively.
To understand this unconventional photon absorption, we propose a multi-channel scattering approach
and study the interaction spectra for edge- and bulk-state channels. We find that, by breaking inversion
and time-reversal symmetries, optical anisotropy is enabled for reflection process, but the transmission
is isotropic. Through a perturbation analysis of the edge-state channel, we show that the anisotropy
in the reflection process originates from the waveguide-mediated non-Hermitian interaction.
However, the inversion symmetry in the non-Hermitian interaction makes the transmission isotropic.
At a topology-protected atomic spacing, the subradiant edge state exhibits huge anisotropy. Due
to the interplay between edge- and bulk-state channels, a large topological bandgap enhances nonreciprocal
reflection of photons in the waveguide for weakly broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e., $\Gamma_0/\Gamma\ll
1$, producing complete photon absorption. We show that our proposal can be implemented in superconducting
quantum circuits. The topology-enhanced photon absorption is useful for quantum detection. This
work shows the potential to manipulate light with topological quantum matter.

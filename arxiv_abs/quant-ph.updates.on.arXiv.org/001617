Optimization of quantum circuits using an efficient compiler is key to its success for NISQ computers.
Several 3rd party compilers are evolving to offer improved performance for large quantum circuits.
These 3rd parties, or just a certain release of an otherwise trustworthy compiler, may possibly
be untrusted and this could lead to an adversary to Reverse Engineer (RE) the quantum circuit for
extracting sensitive aspects e.g., circuit topology, program, and its properties. In this paper,
we propose obfuscation of quantum circuits to hide the functionality. Quantum circuits have inherent
margin between correct and incorrect outputs. Therefore, obfuscation (i.e., corruption of functionality)
by inserting dummy gates is nontrivial. We insert dummy SWAP gates one at a time for maximum corruption
of functionality before sending the quantum circuit to an untrusted compiler. If an untrusted party
clones the design, they get incorrect functionality. The designer removes the dummy SWAP gate post-compilation
to restore the correct functionality. Compared to a classical counterpart, the quantum chip does
not reveal the circuit functionality. Therefore, an adversary cannot guess the SWAP gate and location/validate
using an oracle model. Evaluation of realistic quantum circuit with/without SWAP insertion is
impossible in classical computers. Therefore, we propose a metric-based SWAP gate insertion process.
The objective of the metric is to ensure maximum corruption of functionality measured using Total
Variation Distance (TVD). The proposed approach is validated using IBM default noisy simulation
model. Our metric-based approach predicts the SWAP position to achieve TVD of upto 50%, and performs
7.5% better than average TVD, and performs within 12.3% of the best obtainable TVD for the benchmarks.
We obtain an overhead of < 5% for the number of gates and circuit depth after SWAP addition.

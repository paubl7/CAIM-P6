Squeezing of collective atomic spins has been shown to improve the sensitivity of atomic clocks
and magnetometers to levels significantly below the standard quantum limit. In most cases the requisite
atom-atom entanglement has been generated by dispersive interaction with a quantized probe field,
or by state dependent collisions in a quantum gas. Such experiments typically use complex multilevel
atoms like Rb or Cs, with the relevant interactions designed so atoms behave like pseudo-spin-$1/2$
particles. We demonstrate the viability of spin squeezing for collective spins composed of the
physical angular momenta of $\sim 10^6$ Cs atoms, each in an internal spin-4 hyperfine state. A peak
metrological squeezing of $\gtrsim -5$dB was generated by quantum backaction from a dispersive
quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement, implemented using a two-color optical probe that minimizes
tensor light shifts without sacrificing measurement strength. Other significant developments
include the successful application of composite pulse techniques for accurate dynamical control
of the collective spin, enabled by broadband suppression of background magnetic fields inside
a state-of-the-art magnetic shield. The absence of classical noise has allowed us to compare the
observed quantum projection noise and squeezing to a theoretical model that properly accounts
for both the relevant atomic physics and the spatial mode of the collective spin, finding good quantitative
agreement and thereby validating its use in other contexts. Thus, our work sets the stage for experiments
on quantum feedback, deterministic squeezing, closed-loop magnetometry, and new types of quantum
simulation based on continuous QND measurement and feedback.

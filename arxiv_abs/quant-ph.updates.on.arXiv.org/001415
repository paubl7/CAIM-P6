Quantum random access memory (QRAM)--memory which stores classical data but allows queries to
be performed in superposition--is required for the implementation of numerous quantum algorithms.
While naive implementations of QRAM are highly susceptible to decoherence and hence not scalable,
it has been argued that the bucket brigade QRAM architecture [Giovannetti et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
100 160501 (2008)] is highly resilient to noise, with the infidelity of a query scaling only logarithmically
with the memory size. In prior analyses, however, this favorable scaling followed directly from
the use of contrived noise models, thus leaving open the question of whether experimental implementations
would actually enjoy the purported scaling advantage. In this work, we study the effects of decoherence
on QRAM in full generality. Our main result is a proof that this favorable infidelity scaling holds
for arbitrary error channels (including, e.g., depolarizing noise and coherent errors). Our proof
identifies the origin of this noise resilience as the limited entanglement among the memory's components,
and it also reveals that significant architectural simplifications can be made while preserving
the noise resilience. We verify these results numerically using a novel classical algorithm for
the efficient simulation of noisy QRAM circuits. Our findings indicate that QRAM can be implemented
with existing hardware in realistically noisy devices, and that high-fidelity queries are possible
without quantum error correction. Furthermore, we also prove that the benefits of the bucket-brigade
architecture persist when quantum error correction is used, in which case the scheme offers improved
hardware efficiency and resilience to logical errors.

We present a quantitative, near-term experimental blueprint for the quantum simulation of topological
insulators using lattice-trapped ultracold polar molecules. In particular, we focus on the so-called
Hopf insulator, which represents a three-dimensional topological state of matter existing outside
the conventional tenfold way and crystalline-symmetry-based classifications of topological
insulators. Its topology is protected by a \emph{linking number} invariant, which necessitates
long-range spin-orbit coupled hoppings for its realization. While these ingredients have so far
precluded its realization in solid state systems and other quantum simulation architectures,
in a companion manuscript [1901.08597] we predict that Hopf insulators can in fact arise naturally
in dipolar interacting systems. Here, we investigate a specific such architecture in lattices
of polar molecules, where the effective `spin' is formed from sublattice degrees of freedom. We
introduce two techniques that allow one to optimize dipolar Hopf insulators with large band gaps,
and which should also be readily applicable to the simulation of other exotic bandstructures. First,
we describe the use of Floquet engineering to control the range and functional form of dipolar hoppings
and second, we demonstrate that molecular AC polarizabilities (under circularly polarized light)
can be used to precisely tune the resonance condition between different rotational states. To verify
that this latter technique is amenable to current generation experiments, we calculate from first
principles the AC polarizability for $\sigma^+$ light for ${}^{40}$K$^{87}$Rb. Finally, we show
that experiments are capable of detecting the unconventional topology of the Hopf insulator by
varying the termination of the lattice at its edges, which gives rise to three distinct classes of
edge mode spectra.

Several platforms are being considered as hardware for quantum technologies. For quantum computing
(QC), superconducting qubits and artificially trapped ions are among the leading platforms, but
many others also show promise, e.g. photons, cold atoms, defect centers including Rare-Earth (RE)
ions. So far, results are limited to the regime of noisy intermediate scale qubits (NISQ), with a
small number of qubits and a limited connectivity, and it is likely that future QC hardware will utilize
several existing platforms in different ways. Thus, it currently makes sense to invest resources
broadly and explore the full range of promising routes to quantum technology. Rare-earth ions in
solids constitute one of the most versatile platforms for future quantum technology. One advantage
is good coherence properties even when confined in strong natural traps inside a solid-state matrix.
This confinement allows very high qubit densities and correspondingly strong ion-ion couplings.
In addition, although their fluorescence is generally weak, cavity integration can enhance the
emission greatly and enable very good connections to photonic circuits, including at the telecom
wavelengths, making them promising systems for long-term scalability. The primary aim of this
roadmap is to provide a complete picture of what components a RE quantum computer would consist of,
to describe the details of all parts required to achieve a scalable system, and to discuss the most
promising paths to reach it. In brief, we find that clusters of 50-100 single RE ions can act as high
fidelity qubits in small processors, occupying only about (10 nm)^3. Due to the high capacity for
integration of the RE systems, they be optically read out and connected to other such clusters for
larger scalability. We make suggestions for future improvements, which could allow the REQC platform
to be a leading one.

Confinement of atoms inside various cavities has been studied for nearly eight decades. However,
the Compton profile for such systems has not yet been investigated. Here we construct the Compton
profile (CP) for a H atom radially confined inside a \emph{hard} spherical enclosure, as well as
in \emph{free condition}. Some exact analytical relations for the CP's of circular or nodeless
states of free atom is presented. By means of a scaling idea, this has been further extended to the
study of an H-like atom trapped inside an impenetrable cavity. The accuracy of these constructed
CP has been confirmed by computing various momentum moments. Apart from that, several information
theoretical measures, like Shannon entropy ($S$) and Onicescu energy ($E$) have been exploited
to characterize these profiles. Exact closed form expressions are derived for $S$ and $E$ using
the ground state CP in free H-like atoms. A detailed study reveals that, increase in confinement
inhibits the rate of dissipation of kinetic energy. At a fixed $\ell$, this rate diminishes with
rise in $n$. However, at a certain $n$, this rate accelerates with progress in $\ell$. A similar analysis
on the respective free counterpart displays an exactly opposite trend as that in confined system.
However, in both free and confined environments, CP generally gets broadened with rise in $Z$. Representative
calculations are done numerically for low-lying states of the confined systems, taking two forms
of position-space wave functions: (a) exact (b) highly accurate eigenfunctions through a generalized
pseudospectral method. In essence, CPs are reported for confined H atom (and isoelectronic series)
and investigated adopting an information-theoretic framework.

This thesis investigates geometric approaches to quantum hydrodynamics (QHD) in order to develop
applications in theoretical quantum chemistry. Based upon the momentum map geometric structure
of QHD and the associated Lie-Poisson and Euler-Poincar\'e equations, alternative geometric
approaches to the classical limit in QHD are presented. These include a new regularised Lagrangian
which allows for singular solutions called 'Bohmions' as well as a 'cold fluid' classical closure
quantum mixed states. The momentum map approach to QHD is then applied to the nuclear dynamics in
a chemistry model known as exact factorization. The geometric treatment extends existing approaches
to include unitary electronic evolution in the frame of the nuclear flow, with the resulting dynamics
carrying both Euler-Poincar\'e and Lie-Poisson structures. A new mixed quantum-classical model
is then derived by considering a generalised factorisation ansatz at the level of the molecular
density matrix. A new alternative geometric formulation of QHD is then constructed. Introducing
a $\mathfrak{u}(1)$ connection as the new fundamental variable provides a new method for incorporating
holonomy in QHD, which follows from its constant non-zero curvature. The fluid flow is no longer
irrotational and carries a non-trivial circulation theorem, allowing for vortex filament solutions.
Finally, non-Abelian connections are then considered in quantum mechanics. The dynamics of the
spin vector in the Pauli equation allows for the introduction of an $\mathfrak{so}(3)$ connection
whilst a more general $\mathfrak{u}(\mathscr{H})$ connection is introduced from the unitary
evolution of a quantum system. This is used to provide a new geometric picture for the Berry connection
and quantum geometric tensor, whilst relevant applications to quantum chemistry are then considered.

We explore the relationship between randomness and nonlocality based on arguments which demonstrate
nonlocality without requiring Bell-type inequalities, such as using Hardy relations and its variant
like Cabello-Liang (CL) relations. We first clarify the way these relations enable certification
of Genuine Randomness (GR) based on the No-signalling principle. Subsequently, corresponding
to a given amount of nonlocality, using the relevant quantifier of GR, we demonstrate the following
results: (a) We show that in the 2-2-2 scenario, it is possible to achieve close to the theoretical
maximum value of 2 bits amount of GR using CL relations. Importantly, this maximum value is achieved
using pure non-maximally entangled states for the measurement settings entailing small amount
of nonlocality. Thus, this illustrates quantitative incommensurability between maximum achievable
certified randomness, nonlocality and entanglement in the same testable context. (b) We also obtain
the device-independent guaranteed amount of GR based on Hardy and CL relations, taking into account
the effect of varying preparation procedure which is necessary for ensuring the desired security
in this case against adversarial guessing attack. This result is compared with that obtained earlier
for the Bell-CHSH case. We find that the monotonicity between such guaranteed randomness and nonlocality
persists for the Hardy/CL like for Bell-CHSH inequality, thereby showing commensurability between
guaranteed randomness and nonlocality, in contrast to the case of maximum achievable randomness.
The results of this combined study of maximum achievable as well as guaranteed amounts of GR, obtained
for both fixed and varying preparation procedures, demonstrate that the nature of quantitative
relationship between randomness and nonlocality is crucially dependent on which aspect (guaranteed/maximum
amount) of GR is considered.

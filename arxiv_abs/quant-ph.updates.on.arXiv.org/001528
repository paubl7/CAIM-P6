In the 1960s, computer engineers had to address the tyranny of numbers problem in which improvements
in computing and its applications required integrating an increasing number of electronic components.
From the first computers powered by vacuum tubes to the billions of transistors fabricated on a single
microprocessor chip today, transformational advances in integration have led to remarkable processing
performance and new unforeseen applications in computing. Today, quantum scientists and engineers
are facing similar integration challenges. Research labs packed with benchtop components, such
as tunable lasers, tables filled with optics, and racks of control hardware, are needed to prepare,
manipulate, and read out quantum states from a modest number of qubits. Analogous to electronic
circuit design and fabrication nearly five decades ago, scaling quantum systems (i.e. to thousands
or millions of components and quantum elements) with the required functionality, high performance,
and stability will only be realized through novel design architectures and fabrication techniques
that enable the chip-scale integration of electronic and quantum photonic integrated circuits
(QPIC). In the next decade, with sustained research, development, and investment in the quantum
photonic ecosystem (i.e. PIC-based platforms, devices and circuits, fabrication and integration
processes, packaging, and testing and benchmarking), we will witness the transition from single-
and few-function prototypes to the large-scale integration of multi-functional and reconfigurable
QPICs that will define how information is processed, stored, transmitted, and utilized for quantum
computing, communications, metrology, and sensing. This roadmap highlights the current progress
in the field of integrated quantum photonics, future challenges, and advances in science and technology
needed to meet these challenges.

We consider an oscillating micromirror replacing one of the two fixed mirrors of a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer. In this ideal optical set-up the quantum oscillator is subjected to the radiation
pressure interaction of travelling light waves, no cavity is involved. The aim of this configuration
is to show that squeezed light can be generated by pure scattering on a quantum system, without involving
a cavity. The squeezing can be detected at the output ports of the interferometer either by direct
detection or by measuring the spectrum of the difference current. We use the quantum-stochastic
Schroedinger equation (Hudson-Parthasarathy equation) to model the global evolution. Indeed,
it can describe the scattering of photons and the resulting radiation pressure interaction on the
quantum oscillator. Moreover, it allows to consider also the interaction with a thermal bath, so
that it can describe also the damping of the harmonic oscillator and non-Markovian thermal effects.
In this way we have a unitary dynamics giving the evolution of oscillator and fields. The Bose fields
of quantum stochastic calculus and the related generalized Weyl operators allow to describe the
whole optical circuit. By working in the Heisenberg picture, the quantum Langevin equations for
position and momentum and the output fields arise, which are used to describe the monitoring in continuous
time of the light at the output ports. In the case of strong laser and weak radiation pressure interaction
a pronounced squeezing is detected either by direct detection (a negative Mandel Q-parameter is
found), either by the intensity spectrum of the difference current of two photodetector; in the
second case a nearly complete cancellation of the shot noise can be reached.

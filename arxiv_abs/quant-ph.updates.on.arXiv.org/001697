A standard approach to quantifying resources is to determine which operations on the resources
are freely available, and to deduce the partial order over resources that is induced by the relation
of convertibility under the free operations. If the resource of interest is the nonclassicality
of the correlations embodied in a quantum state, i.e., entanglement, then the common assumption
is that the appropriate choice of free operations is Local Operations and Classical Communication
(LOCC). We here advocate for the study of a different choice of free operations, namely, Local Operations
and Shared Randomness (LOSR), and demonstrate its utility in understanding the interplay between
the entanglement of states and the nonlocality of the correlations in Bell experiments. Specifically,
we show that the LOSR paradigm (i) provides a resolution of the anomalies of nonlocality, wherein
partially entangled states exhibit more nonlocality than maximally entangled states, (ii) entails
new notions of genuine multipartite entanglement and nonlocality that are free of the pathological
features of the conventional notions, and (iii) makes possible a resource-theoretic account of
the self-testing of entangled states which generalizes and simplifies prior results. Along the
way, we derive some fundamental results concerning the necessary and sufficient conditions for
convertibility between pure entangled states under LOSR and highlight some of their consequences,
such as the impossibility of catalysis for bipartite pure states. The resource-theoretic perspective
also clarifies why it is neither surprising nor problematic that there are mixed entangled states
which do not violate any Bell inequality. Our results motivate the study of LOSR-entanglement as
a new branch of entanglement theory.

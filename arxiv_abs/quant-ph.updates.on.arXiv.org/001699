Local symmetric quantum circuits are those that contain only local unitaries that respect a certain
symmetry. These circuits provide a simple framework to study the dynamics and phases of complex
quantum systems with conserved charges; however, some of their basic properties have not yet been
understood. Recently, it has been shown that such quantum circuits only generate a restricted subset
of symmetric unitary transformations. In this paper, we consider circuits with 2-local SU(d)-invariant
unitaries acting on qudits, i.e., d-dimensional quantum systems. Our results reveal a significant
distinction between the cases of d=2 and d>=3. For qubits with SU(2) symmetry, arbitrary global
rotationally-invariant unitaries can be generated with 2-local ones, up to relative phases between
the subspaces corresponding to inequivalent irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetry,
i.e., sectors with different angular momenta. On the other hand, for d>=3, in addition to similar
constraints on relative phases between the irreps, locality also restricts the generated unitaries
inside these conserved subspaces. In particular, for certain irreps of SU(d), the dynamics under
2-local SU(d)-invariant unitaries can be mapped to the dynamics of a non-interacting (free) fermionic
system, whereas for general 3-local ones, the corresponding fermionic model is interacting. Using
this correspondence, we obtain new conservation laws for dynamics under 2-local SU(d)-invariant
unitaries. Furthermore, we identify a Z2 symmetry related to the parity of permutations which imposes
additional conservation laws for systems with n<=d^2 qudits for d>=3. Our results imply that the
distribution of unitaries generated by random 2-local SU(d)-invariant unitaries does not converge
to the Haar measure over the group of all SU(d)-invariant unitaries, and in fact, for d>=3, is not
even a 2-design for the Haar distribution.

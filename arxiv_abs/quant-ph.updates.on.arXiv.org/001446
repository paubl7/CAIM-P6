Since the birth of quantum optics, the measurement of quantum states of nonclassical light has been
of tremendous importance for advancement in the field. To date, conventional detectors such as
photomultipliers, avalanche photodiodes, and superconducting nanowires, all rely at their core
on linear excitation of bound electrons with light, posing fundamental restrictions on the detection.
In contrast, the interaction of free electrons with light in the context of quantum optics is highly
nonlinear and offers exciting possibilities. The first experiments that promoted this direction
appeared over the past decade as part of photon-induced nearfield electron microscopy (PINEM),
wherein free electrons are capable of high-order multi-photon absorption and emission. Here we
propose using free electrons for quantum-optical detection of the complete quantum state of light.
We show how the precise control of the electron before and after its interaction with quantum light
enables to extract the photon statistics and implement full quantum state tomography using PINEM.
This technique can reach sub-attosecond time resolutions, measure temporal coherence of any degree
(e.g., g(1), g(2)), and simultaneously detect large numbers of photons with each electron. Importantly,
the interaction of the electron with light is non-destructive, thereby leaving the photonic state
(modified by the interaction) intact, which is conceptually different from conventional detectors.
By using a pulse of multiple electrons, we envision how PINEM quantum detectors could achieve a single-shot
measurement of the complete state of quantum light, even for non-reproducible emission events.
Altogether, our work paves the way to novel kinds of photodetectors that utilize the ultrafast duration,
high nonlinearity, and non-destructive nature of electron-light interactions.

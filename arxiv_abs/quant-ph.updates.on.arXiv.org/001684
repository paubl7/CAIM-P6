Ab initio electronic excited state calculations are necessary for the quantitative study of photochemical
reactions, but their accurate computation on classical computers is plagued by prohibitive scaling.
The Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) is an extension of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver
(VQE) for calculating electronic excited state energies, and has the potential to address some
of these scaling challenges using quantum computers. However, quantum computers available in
the near term can only support a limited number of circuit operations, so reducing the quantum computational
cost in VQD methods is critical to their realisation. In this work, we investigate the use of adaptive
quantum circuit growth (ADAPT-VQE) in excited state VQD calculations, a strategy that has been
successful previously in reducing the resource for ground state energy VQE calculations. We also
invoke spin restrictions to separate the recovery of eigenstates with different spin symmetry
to reduce the number of calculations and accumulation of errors. We created a quantum eigensolver
emulation package - Quantum Eigensolver Building on Achievements of Both quantum computing and
quantum chemistry (QEBAB) - for testing the proposed adaptive procedure against two VQD methods
that use fixed-length quantum circuits. For a lithium hydride test case we found that the spin-restricted
adaptive growth variant of VQD uses the most compact circuits by far, consistently recovers adequate
electron correlation energy for different nuclear geometries and eigenstates while isolating
the singlet and triplet manifold. This work is a further step towards developing techniques which
improve the efficiency of hybrid quantum algorithms for excited state quantum chemistry, opening
up the possibility of exploiting real quantum computers for electronic excited state calculations
sooner than previously anticipated.

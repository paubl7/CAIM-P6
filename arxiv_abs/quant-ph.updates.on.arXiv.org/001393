For low dimension systems admitting a moment equation representation (MER), the development of
an effective eigenenergy bounding theory applicable to all discrete states had remained elusive,
until now. Whereas Handy et al (1988 Phys. Rev. Lett. 60 253) demonstrated the effectiveness of the
{\it Moment Problem} based, Eigenvalue Moment Method (EMM), for generating arbitrarily tight
bounds to the multidimensional, positive, bosonic ground state, its extension to arbitrary excited
states seemed intractable. We have discovered a new, moment representation based, quantization
formalism that achieves this. Unlike EMM, no convex optimization methods are required. The entire
formulation is algebraic. As a result of our preliminary investigation, we are able to match, or
surpass, the excellent, but intricate, analysis of Kravchenko et al (1996 Phys. Rev. A 54 287) with
respect to the quadratic Zeeman effect, for a broad range of magnetic field strengths. Unlike their
analysis, the proposed method is simple, involves no truncations, and the projection of the quantum
operator is exact, within each moment subspace. Our new approach, the Orthogonal Polynomial Projection
Quantization-Bounding Method (OPPQ-BM), exploits the implicit bounding capabilities of a previous
method developed by Handy and Vrinceanu (2013 J. of Phys. A: Math. Theor. 46 135202). What emerges
is a completely new type of analysis (i.e. constrained quadratic form minimization) that validates
the importance of moment equation representations for quantizing physical systems. Whereas the
underlying principles of EMM guarantee it to be more efficient than OPPQ-BM, the ability to implement
algebraic computations, as opposed to pursuing nonlinear convex optimization methods (which
can be relaxed through linear programming alternatives) recommends OPPQ-BM. We give an overview
of the new method with applications.

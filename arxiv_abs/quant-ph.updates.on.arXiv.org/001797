Focusing on the algebraical analysis of two various kinds of one-dimensional G-dynamics ${{\hat{w}}^{\left(
cl \right)}}$ and ${{\hat{w}}^{\left( ri\right)}}$ separately induced by different Hamiltonian
operators $\hat{H} $ are the keypoints. In this work, it's evidently proved that an identity ${{\hat{w}}^{\left(
cl \right)}}{{u}^{-1/2}}\equiv0$ always holds for any $u>0$ based on the formula of one-dimensional
G-dynamics ${{\hat{w}}^{\left( cl \right)}}$. We prove that the G-dynamics ${{\hat{w}}^{\left(
cl \right)}}$ and ${{\hat{w}}^{\left( ri\right)}}$ obey Leibniz identity if and only if ${{\hat{w}}^{\left(
cl \right)}}1=0$ and ${{\hat{w}}^{\left( ri\right)}}1=0$, respectively. \par In accordance
with the G-dynamics ${{\hat{w}}^{\left( cl \right)}}$, we investigate the unique eigenvalues
equation ${{\hat{w}}^{\left( cl \right)}}L\left( u,t,\lambda \right)=-\sqrt{-1}\lambda
L\left( u,t,\lambda \right)$ of the G-dynamics with a precise geometric eigenfunction $L\left(
u,t,\lambda \right)={{u}^{-1/2}}{{e}^{{{\lambda }}t}},~u>0$ as time $t\in \left[ 0,T \right]$
develops and the equation of energy spectrum is then induced. The non-Hermitian Hamiltonian operators
are studied as well, we obtain a series of ODE with their special solutions, and we prove multiplicative
property of the geometric eigenfunction. The coordinate derivative and time evolution of the G-dynamics
are respectively considered. Seeking the invariance of G-dynamics ${{\hat{w}}^{\left( cl \right)}}$
under coordinate transformation is considered, so that we think of one-dimensional G-dynamics
${{\hat{w}}^{\left( cl \right)}}$ on coordinate transformation, it gives the rule of conversion
between two coordinate systems. As a application, some examples are given for such rule of conversion.
Meanwhile, we search the conditions that quantum geometric bracket vanishes and a specific case
follows.

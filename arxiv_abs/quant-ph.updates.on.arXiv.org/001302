The fundamental vacuum state, related to Minkowski empty space, produces divergent fluctuations
of the quantum fields that have to be subtracted in order to bring reality to the description of the
physical system. This is a methodology well confirmed in laboratory with impressive accuracy.
Nonetheless, when we subtract such empty space contribution, we open the possibility to have negative
vacuum expectation values of classically positive-defined quantities. This is what has been addressed
in the literature as subvacuum phenomenon. Here it is investigated how a scalar charged particle
is affected by the vacuum fluctuations of massive scalar field in D + 1 spacetime when the background
evolves from empty space to a thermal bath, and also when a perfectly reflecting boundary is included.
It is shown that when the particle is brought into a thermal bath it gains an amount energy by means
of positive dispersions of its velocity components. The magnitude of this effect is dependent on
the temperature and also on the field mass. As an outcome no subvacuum effect occurs. However, when
a reflecting wall is inserted into this system, the dispersions can be positive or negative, showing
that subvacuum effect happens even in a finite temperature environment. This is what we believe
to be the main result of this paper. Another relevant aspect is that the magnitude of the effects here
discussed are fundamentally dependent on the switching interval of time the system takes to evolve
between two states. Such switching is implemented by means of smooth sample functions connecting
the considered states. In this way, the stochastic motion induced over the particle is essentially
different from a classical Brownian motion.

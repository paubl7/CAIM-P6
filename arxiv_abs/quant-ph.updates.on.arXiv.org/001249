We propose a nonadiabatic non-Abelian geometric quantum operation scheme to realize universal
quantum computation with mesoscopic Rydberg atoms. A single control atom entangles a mesoscopic
ensemble of target atoms through long-range interactions between Rydberg states. We demonstrate
theoretically that both the single qubit and two-qubit quantum gates can achieve high fidelities
around or above 99.9% in ideal situations. Besides, to address the experimental issue of Rabi frequency
fluctuation (Rabi error) in Rydberg atom and ensemble, we apply the dynamical-invariant-based
zero systematic-error sensitivity (ZSS) optimal control theory to the proposed scheme. Our numerical
simulations show that the average fidelity could be 99.98% for single ensemble qubit gate and 99.94%
for two-qubit gate even when the Rabi frequency of the gate laser acquires 10% fluctuations. We also
find that the optimized scheme can also reduce errors caused by higher-order perturbation terms
in deriving the Hamiltonian of the ensemble atoms. To address the experimental issue of decoherence
error between the ground state and Rydberg levels in Rydberg ensemble, we introduce a dispersive
coupling regime between Rydberg and ground levels, based on which the Rydberg state is adiabatically
discarded. The numerical simulation demonstrate that the quantum gate is enhanced. By combining
strong Rydberg atom interactions, nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation, dynamical invariant
and optimal control theory together, our scheme shows a new route to construct fast and robust quantum
gates with mesoscopic atomic ensembles. Our study contributes to the ongoing effort in developing
quantum information processing with Rydberg atoms trapped in optical lattices or tweezer arrays.

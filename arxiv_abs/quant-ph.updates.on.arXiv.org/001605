Quantum state estimation for continuously monitored dynamical systems involves assigning a quantum
state to an individual system at some time, conditioned on the results of continuous observations.
The quality of the estimation depends on how much observed information is used and on how optimality
is defined for the estimate. In this work, we consider problems of quantum state estimation where
some of the measurement records are not available, but where the available records come from both
before (past) and after (future) the estimation time, enabling better estimates than is possible
using the past information alone. Past-future information for quantum systems has been used in
various ways in the literature, in particular, the quantum state smoothing, the most-likely path,
and the two-state vector and related formalisms. To unify these seemingly unrelated approaches,
we propose a framework for partially-observed quantum system with continuous monitoring, wherein
the first two existing formalisms can be accommodated, with some generalization. The unifying
framework is based on state estimation with expected cost minimization, where the cost can be defined
either in the space of the unknown record or in the space of the unknown true state. Moreover, we connect
all three existing approaches conceptually by defining five new cost functions, and thus new types
of estimators, which bridge the gaps between them. We illustrate the applicability of our method
by calculating all seven estimators we consider for the example of a driven two-level system dissipatively
coupled to bosonic baths. Our theory also allows connections to classical state estimation, which
create further conceptual links between our quantum state estimators.

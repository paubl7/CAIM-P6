When a resonant photon traverses a sample of absorbing atoms, how much time do atoms spend in the excited
state? Does the answer depend on whether the photon is ultimately absorbed or transmitted? In particular,
if it is $\textit{not}$ absorbed, does it cause atoms to spend any time in the excited state, and if
so, how much? In an experiment with ultra-cold Rubidium atoms, we simultaneously record whether
atoms are excited by incident ("signal") photons and whether those photons are transmitted. We
measure the time spent by atoms in the excited state by using a separate, off-resonant "probe" laser
to monitor the index of refraction of the sample - that is, we measure the nonlinear phase shift written
by a signal pulse on this probe beam - and use direct detection to isolate the effect of single transmitted
photons. For short pulses (10 ns, to be compared to the 26 ns atomic lifetime) and an optically thick
medium (peak OD = 4, leading to 60% absorption given our broad bandwidth), we find that the average
time atoms spend in the excited state due to one transmitted photon is not zero, but rather (77 $\pm$
16)% of the time the average incident photon causes them to spend in the excited state. We attribute
this observation of "excitation without loss" to coherent forward emission, which can arise when
the instantaneous Rabi frequency (pulse envelope) picks up a phase flip - this happens naturally
when a broadband pulse propagates through an optically thick medium with frequency-dependent
absorption [1]. These results unambiguously reveal the complex history of photons as they propagate
through an absorbing medium and illustrate the power of utilizing post-selection to experimentally
investigate the past behaviour of observed quantum systems.

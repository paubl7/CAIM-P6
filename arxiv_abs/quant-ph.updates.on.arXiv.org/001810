In this essay, we explore the limits imposed by the impossibility of superluminal signalling on
the class of physically realisable quantum operations, focusing on the difference in approaches
one can take towards this problem in Hilbert space quantum theory and algebraic quantum field theory
(AQFT). We review a recent proposal by Fewster and Verch for a generally covariant measurement scheme
in AQFT, which we call the FV scheme; along the way, we argue that the framework as set up in its original
proposal can be greatly simplified without losing generality or physical motivation. We then discuss
the problem, introduced by Sorkin, that naive generalisations of the notion of operation to the
relativistic context can lead to signalling between spacelike observers by introducing a third
observer. We consider approaches to tackle this problem in Hilbert space quantum theory and argue
that these are sometimes ambiguous, since the physical (im)possibility of operations depends
in part on the specific spacetime embodiment of the quantum system under consideration, which lies
outside the Hilbert space formalism. In the AQFT context, we review and generalise a recent result
showing that operations induced by the FV measurement scheme do not enable superluminal signalling.
We connect this result to Hilbert space by introducing a concrete model of AQFT, which we call the
`hybrid model' as it provides a way to explicitly embed Hilbert space quantum theory into spacetime
using the formalism of AQFT. Finally, we show that in this model, under suitable necessary and sufficient
conditions, the converse result also holds: every operation that does not enable superluminal
signalling can be implemented in the FV framework.

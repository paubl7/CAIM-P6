Recently a theoretical and an experimental protocol known as quantum gravity induced entanglement
of masses (QGEM) has been proposed to test the quantum nature of gravity using two mesoscopic masses
each placed in a superposition of two locations. If, after eliminating all non-gravitational interactions
between them, the particles become entangled, one can conclude that the gravitational potential
is induced via a quantum mediator, i.e. a virtual graviton. In this paper, we examine a range of different
experimental set-ups, considering different geometries and the number of spatially superposed
states taken, in order to determine which would generate entanglement faster. We conclude that
without decoherence, and given a maximum distance $\Delta x$ between any two spatial states of a
superposition, a set of two qubits placed in spatial superposition parallel to one another will
outperform all other models given realistic experimental parameters. Furthermore, when a sufficiently
high decoherence rate is introduced, multi-component superpositions can outperform the two-qubit
set-up. This is further verified with an experimental simulation, showing that $O(10^3)$ measurements
are required to reject the no entanglement hypothesis with a parallel qubits set-up without decoherence
at a 99.9$\%$ confidence level. The number of measurements increases when decoherence is introduced.
When the decoherence rate reaches $0.125$~Hz, 6-dimensional qudits are required as the two-qubit
system entanglement cannot be witnessed anymore. However, in this case, $O(10^6)$ measurements
will be required. One can group the witness operators to measure in order to reduce the number of measurements
(up to ten-fold). However, this may be challenging to implement experimentally.

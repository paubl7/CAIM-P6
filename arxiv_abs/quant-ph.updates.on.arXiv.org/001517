Neutral atom arrays are promising for large-scale quantum computing especially because it is possible
to prepare large-scale qubit arrays. An unsolved issue is how to selectively excite one qubit deep
in a 3D atomic array to Rydberg states. In this work, we show two methods for this purpose. The first
method relies on a well-known result: in a dipole transition between two quantum states driven by
two off-resonant fields of equal strength but opposite detunings $\pm\Delta$, the transition
is characterized by two counter-rotating Rabi frequencies $\Omega e^{\pm i\Delta t}$~[or $\pm\Omega
e^{\pm i\Delta t}$ if the two fields have a $\pi$-phase difference]. This pair of detuned fields
lead to a time-dependent Rabi frequency $2\Omega \cos(\Delta t)$~[or $2i\Omega \sin(\Delta t)$],
so that a full transition between the two levels is recovered. We show that when the two detuned fields
are sent in different directions, one atom in a 3D optical lattice can be selectively addressed for
Rydberg excitation, and when its state is restored, the state of any nontarget atoms irradiated
in the light path is also restored. Moreover, we find that the Rydberg excitation by this method can
significantly suppress the fundamental blockade error of a Rydberg gate, paving the way for a high-fidelity
entangling gate with commonly used quasi-rectangular pulse that is easily obtained by pulse pickers.
Along the way, we find a second method for single-site Rydberg addressing in 3D, where a selected
target atom can be excited to Rydberg state while preserving the state of any nontarget atom due to
a spin echo sequence. The capability to selectively address a target atom in 3D atomic arrays for
Rydberg excitation makes it possible to design large-scale neutral-atom information processor
based on Rydberg blockade.

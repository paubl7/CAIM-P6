Most material properties of great physical interest are directly related to nuclear dynamics,
e.g. the ionic thermal conductivity, Raman/IR vibrational spectra, inelastic X-ray, and Neutron
scattering. A theory able to compute from first principles these properties, accounting for the
anharmonicity and quantum fluctuations in the nuclear energy landscape that can be implemented
in systems with hundreds of atoms is missing. Here, we derive an approximate theory for the quantum
time evolution of lattice vibrations at finite temperature. This theory introduces the time dynamics
in the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) and shares with the static case the same computational
cost. It is nonempirical, as pure states evolve according to the Dirac least action principle and
the dynamics of the thermal ensemble conserves both energy and entropy. The static SCHA is recovered
as a stationary solution of the dynamical equations. We apply perturbation theory around the static
SCHA solution and derive an algorithm to compute efficiently quantum dynamical response functions.
Thanks to this new algorithm, we have access to the response function of any general external time-dependent
perturbation, enabling the simulation of phonon spectra without following any perturbative expansion
of the nuclear potential or empirical methods. We benchmark the algorithm on the IR and Raman spectroscopy
of high-pressure hydrogen phase III, with a simulation cell of 96 atoms. Our work also explores the
nonlinear regime of the dynamical nuclear motion, providing a paradigm to simulate the interaction
with intense or multiple probes, as in pump-probe spectroscopy, or chemical reactions involving
light atoms, as the proton transfer in biomolecules

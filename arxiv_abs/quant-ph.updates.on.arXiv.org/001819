A neo-classical relativistic mechanics model is presented where the spin of an electron is a natural
part of its space-time path. The fourth-order equation of motion corresponds to the same Lagrangian
function in proper time as in special relativity except for an additional spin energy term. The total
motion can be decomposed into a sum of a local circular motion giving the spin and a global motion of
the spin center, each being governed by a second-order differential equation. The local spin motion
corresponds to Schr\"odinger's zitterbewegung and is a perpetual motion; it produces magnetic
and electric dipoles through the Lorentz force on the electron's point charge. The global motion
is sub-luminal and described by Newton's second law in proper time, the time for a clock fixed at the
spin center, where the inertia to acceleration resides. The total motion occurs at the speed of light
c, consistent with the eigenvalues of Dirac's velocity operators having magnitude c. A spin tensor
is introduced that is the angular momentum of the electron's total motion about its spin center.
The fundamental equations of motion expressed using this tensor are identical to those of the Barut-Zanghi
theory; they can be expressed in an equivalent form using the same operators as in Dirac's theory
for the electron but applied to a state function of proper time satisfying a Dirac-Schr\"odinger
spinor equation. This state function produces a neo-classical wave function that satisfies Dirac's
relativistic wave equation for the free electron when the Lorentz transformation is used to express
proper time in terms of an observer's space-time coordinates. In summary, the theory provides a
hidden-variable model for spin that leads to Dirac's relativistic wave equation and explains the
electron's moment coupling to an electro-magnetic field, albeit with a magnetic moment that is
one half of that in Dirac's theory.

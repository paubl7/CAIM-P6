Light beams offer many degrees of freedom to be explored in discrete and continuous domains. In addition
to the possibility of entangling photons in these many degrees of freedom, it makes light a very useful
and versatile tool for quantum information and quantum foundation purposes. In this thesis, we
endorse its importance and versatility by presenting novel contributions that further explore
both discrete and continuous degrees of freedom. It begins with two experiments that use classical
light and explore its analogous behavior to quantum systems. The first one is a classical optics
simulation of the dynamics of a relativistic quantum particle. The second work is related to the
theory of mutually unbiased measurements that are effectively discrete but constructed from continuous
variables systems. In the second part of the thesis, three works are presented that use the polarization
and path discrete degrees of freedom. The first one is a redefinition of the quantum nonlocal correlation
called steering in the multipartite scenario, based on an inconsistency in the previous definition,
namely the creation of this correlation from scratch using operations that supposedly would not
be able to do so. We call this exposure of quantum steering. Steering exposure is observed with entangled
photons. The other two works are related to the experimental implementation of quantum channels
of qubits, one of them is a particular channel for which we test for non-Markovianity using a operational
measure called conditional past-future (CPF) correlation. The thesis finishes with a proposal
for an experimental realization of any quantum channel of a single qubit, where the qubit is realized
by the polarization of single photons. The functioning of all optical devices used is didactically
explained.

Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is a paradigm for low-power, general-purpose, classical
computing designed to overcome the challenges facing CMOS in the extreme limits of scaling. A molecular
implementation of QCA offers nanometer-scale devices with device densities and operating speeds
which may surpass CMOS device densities and speeds by several orders of magnitude, all at room temperature.
Here, a proposal for electric field bit write-in to molecular QCA circuits is extended to synchronous
QCA circuits clocked using an applied electric field, \(\vec{E}\). Input electrodes, which may
be much larger than the cells themselves, immerse an input circuit in an input field \(E_y \hat{y}\),
in addition to the applied clocking field \(E_z \hat{z}\). The input field selects the input bit
on a field-sensitive portion of the circuit. Another portion of the circuit with reduced \(E_y\)-sensitivity
functions as a shift register, transmitting the input bit to downstream QCA logic for processing.
It is shown that a simple rotation of the molecules comprising the shift register makes them immune
to unwanted effects from the input field or fringing fields in the direction of the input field. Furthermore,
the circuits also tolerate a significant unwanted field component \(E_x \hat{x}\) in the third
direction, which is neither the clocking nor input direction. The write-in of classical bits to
molecular QCA circuits is a road-block that must be cleared in order to realize energy-efficient
molecular computation using QCA. The results presented here show that interconnecting shift registers
may be designed to function in the presence of significant unwanted fringing fields from large input
electrodes. Furthermore, the techniques devloped here may also enable molecular QCA logic to tolerate
these same unwanted fringing fields.

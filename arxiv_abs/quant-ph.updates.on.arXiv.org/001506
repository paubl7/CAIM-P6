Quantum materials exhibit a wide array of exotic phenomena and practically useful properties.
A better understanding of these materials can provide deeper insights into fundamental physics
in the quantum realm as well as advance technology for entertainment, healthcare, and sustainability.
The emergence of digital quantum computers (DQCs), which can efficiently perform quantum simulations
that are otherwise intractable on classical computers, provides a promising path forward for testing
and analyzing the remarkable, and often counter-intuitive, behavior of quantum materials. Equipped
with these new tools, scientists from diverse domains are racing towards physical quantum supremacy
(i.e., using a quantum computer to learn new physics with a computation that cannot feasibly be run
on any classical computer). The aim of this review, therefore, is to provide a summary of progress
made towards this goal that is accessible to scientists across the physical sciences. We will first
review the available technology and algorithms, and detail the myriad ways to represent materials
on quantum computers. Next, we will showcase the simulations that have been successfully performed
on currently available DQCs, emphasizing the variety of properties, both static and dynamic, that
can be studied with this nascent technology. Finally, we work through two examples of how to map a
materials problem onto a DQC, with full code included in the Supplementary Material. It is our hope
that this review can serve as an organized overview of progress in the field for domain experts and
an accessible introduction to scientists in related fields interested in beginning to perform
their own simulations of quantum materials on DQCs.

Models for non-unitary quantum dynamics, such as quantum circuits that include projective measurements,
have been shown to exhibit rich quantum critical behavior. There are many complementary perspectives
on this behavior. For example, there is a known correspondence between d-dimensional local non-unitary
quantum circuits and tensor networks on a D=(d+1)-dimensional lattice. Here, we show that in the
case of systems of non-interacting fermions, there is furthermore a full correspondence between
non-unitary circuits in d spatial dimensions and unitary non-interacting fermion problems with
static Hermitian Hamiltonians in D=(d+1) spatial dimensions. This provides a powerful new perspective
for understanding entanglement phases and critical behavior exhibited by non-interacting circuits.
Classifying the symmetries of the corresponding non-interacting Hamiltonian, we show that a large
class of random circuits, including the most generic circuits with randomness in space and time,
are in correspondence with Hamiltonians with static spatial disorder in the ten Altland-Zirnbauer
symmetry classes. We find the criticality that is known to occur in all of these classes to be the origin
of the critical entanglement properties of the corresponding random non-unitary circuit. To exemplify
this, we numerically study the quantum states at the boundary of Haar-random Gaussian fermionic
tensor networks of dimension D=2 and D=3. We show that the most general such tensor network ensemble
corresponds to a unitary problem of non-interacting fermions with static disorder in Altland-Zirnbauer
symmetry class DIII, which for both D=2 and D=3 is known to exhibit a stable critical metallic phase.
Tensor networks and corresponding random non-unitary circuits in the other nine Altland-Zirnbauer
symmetry classes can be obtained from the DIII case by implementing Clifford algebra extensions
for classifying spaces.

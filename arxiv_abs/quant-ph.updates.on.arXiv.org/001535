We reconsider the all-optical homodyne-measurement based experimental schemes that aim to reveal
Bell nonclassicality of a single photon, often termed `nonlocality'. We focus on the schemes put
forward by Tan, Walls and Collett (TWC, 1991) and Hardy (1994). In the light of our previous work the
Tan, Walls and Collett setup can be described by a precise local hidden variable model, hence the
claimed nonclassicality of this proposal is apparent, whereas the nonclassicality proof proposed
by Hardy is impeccable. In this work we resolve the following problem: which feature of the Hardy's
approach is crucial for its successful confirmation of nonclassicality. The scheme of Hardy differs
from the Tan, Walls and Collett setup in two aspects. (i) It introduces a superposition of a single
photon excitation with vacuum as the initial state of one of the input modes of a 50-50 beamsplitter,
which creates the superposition state of two separable (exit) modes under investigation. (ii)
In the final measurements Hardy's proposal utilises a varying strengths of the local oscillator
fields, whereas in the TWC case they are constant. In fact the local oscillators in Hardy's scheme
are either on or off (the local setting is specified by the presence or absence of the local auxiliary
field). We show that it is the varying strength of the local oscillators, from setting to setting,
which is the crucial feature enabling violation of local realism in the Hardy setup, whereas it is
not necessary to use initial superposition of a single photon excitation with vacuum as the initial
state of the input mode. Neither one needs to operate in the fully on/off detection scheme. Despite
the failure of the Tan, Walls and Collett scheme in proving Bell nonclassicality, we show that their
scheme can serve as an entanglement indicator.

Device-Independent (DI) security is the best form of quantum cryptography, providing information-theoretic
security based on the very laws of nature. In its highest form, security is guaranteed against adversaries
limited only by the no-superluminal signalling rule of relativity. The task of randomness amplification,
to generate secure fully uniform bits starting from weakly random seeds, is of both cryptographic
and foundational interest, being important for the generation of cryptographically secure random
numbers as well as bringing deep connections to the existence of free-will. DI no-signalling proof
protocols for this fundamental task have thus far relied on esoteric proofs of non-locality termed
pseudo-telepathy games, complicated multi-party setups or high-dimensional quantum systems,
and have remained out of reach of experimental implementation. In this paper, we construct the first
practically relevant no-signalling proof DI protocols for randomness amplification based on
the simplest proofs of Bell non-locality and illustrate them with an experimental implementation
in a quantum optical setup using polarised photons. Technically, we relate the problem to the vast
field of Hardy paradoxes, without which it would be impossible to achieve amplification of arbitrarily
weak sources in the simplest Bell non-locality scenario consisting of two parties choosing between
two binary inputs. Furthermore, we identify a deep connection between proofs of the celebrated
Kochen-Specker theorem and Hardy paradoxes that enables us to construct Hardy paradoxes with the
non-zero probability taking any value in $(0,1]$. Our methods enable us, under the fair-sampling
assumption of the experiment, to realize up to $25$ bits of randomness in $20$ hours of experimental
data collection from an initial private source of randomness $0.1$ away from uniform.

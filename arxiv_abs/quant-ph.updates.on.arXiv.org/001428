A promising use of quantum computers is to prepare quantum states that model complex domains, such
as correlated electron wavefunctions or the underlying distribution of a complex dataset. Such
states need to be verified in view of algorithmic approximations and device imperfections. As quantum
computers grow in size, however, verifying the states they produce becomes increasingly problematic.
Relatively efficient methods have been devised for verifying sparse quantum states, but dense
quantum states have remained costly to verify. Here I present a novel method for estimating the fidelity
$F(\mu,\tau)$ between a preparable quantum state $\mu$ and a classically specified target state
$\tau$, using simple quantum circuits and on-the-fly classical calculation (or lookup) of selected
amplitudes of $\tau$. Notably, in the targeted regime the method demonstrates an exponential quantum
advantage in sample efficiency over any classical method. The simplest version of the method is
efficient for anticoncentrated quantum states (including many states that are hard to simulate
classically), with a sample cost of approximately $4\epsilon^{-2}(1-F)dp_{\text{coll}}$ where
$\epsilon$ is the desired precision of the estimate, $d$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space in
which $\mu$ and $\tau$ reside, and $p_{\text{coll}}$ is the collision probability of the target
distribution. I also present a more sophisticated version of the method, which uses any efficiently
preparable and well-characterized quantum state as an importance sampler to further reduce the
number of copies of $\mu$ needed. Though some challenges remain, this work takes a significant step
toward scalable verification of complex states produced by quantum processors.

A prototypical model of a one-dimensional metallic monatomic solid containing noninteracting
electrons is studied, where the argument of the cosine potential energy periodic with the lattice
contains the first reciprocal lattice vector G1 = 2pi/a, where a is the lattice constant. The time-independent
Schrodinger equation can be written in reduced variables as a Mathieu equation for which numerically-exact
solutions for the band structure and wave functions are obtained. The band structure has band gaps
that increase with increasing amplitude q of the cosine potential. In the extended-zone scheme,
the energy gaps decrease with increasing index n of the Brillouin-zone boundary ka = n pi where k is
the crystal momentum of the electron. The wave functions at the bottoms and tops of the bands are found
to be real or imaginary, respectively, corresponding to standing waves at these energies. Irrespective
of the wave vector k within the first Brillouin zone, the electron probability density is found to
be periodic with the lattice. The Fourier components of the wave functions are derived versus q,
which reveal multiple reciprocal-lattice-vector components with variable amplitudes in the
wave functions unless q = 0. The magnitudes of the Fourier components are found to decrease exponentially
as a power of n for n ~ 3 to 45 for ka = pi/2 and q = 2 and a precise fit is obtained to the data. The probability
densities and probability currents obtained from the wave functions are also discussed. The probability
currents are found to be zero for crystal momenta at the tops and bottoms of the energy bands, because
the wave functions for these crystal momenta are standing waves. Finally, the band structure is
calculated from the central equation and compared to the numerically-exact band structure.

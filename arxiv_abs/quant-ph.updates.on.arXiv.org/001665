Drawing on ideas from game theory and quantum physics, we investigate nonlocal correlations from
the point of view of equilibria in games of incomplete information. These equilibria can be classified
in decreasing power as communication equilibria, belief-invariant equilibria, and correlated
equilibria, all of which contain the familiar Nash equilibria. The notion of belief-invariant
equilibrium appeared in game theory in the 90s. However, the class of non-signalling correlations
associated to belief-invariance arose naturally already in the 80s in the foundations of quantum
mechanics. In the present work, we explain and unify these two origins of the idea and study the above
classes of equilibria, together with quantum correlated equilibria, using tools from quantum
information but the language of (algorithmic) game theory. We present a general framework of belief-invariant
communication equilibria, which contains correlated equilibria and quantum correlated equilibria
as special cases. Our framework also contains the theory of Bell inequalities and their violations
due to non-locality, which is a question of intense interest in the foundations of quantum mechanics,
and it was indeed the original motivation for the aforementioned studies. Moreover, in our framework
we can also model quantum games where players have conflicting interests, a recent developing topic
in physics. We then use our framework to show new results related to the social welfare of equilibria.
Namely, we exhibit a game where belief-invariance is socially better than any correlated equilibrium,
and a game where all non-belief-invariant communication equilibria have a suboptimal social welfare.
We also show that optimal social welfare can sometimes be achieved by quantum mechanical correlations,
which do not need an informed mediator to be implemented, and go beyond the classical shared randomness
approach.

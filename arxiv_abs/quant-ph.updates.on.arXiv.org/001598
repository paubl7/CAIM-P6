Formation of quantum scars in many-body systems provides a novel mechanism for enhancing coherence
of weakly entangled states. At the same time, coherence of edge modes in certain symmetry protected
topological (SPT) phases can persist away from the ground state. In this work we show the existence
of many-body scars and their implications on bulk coherence in such an SPT phase. To this end, we study
the eigenstate properties and the dynamics of an interacting spin-$1/2$ chain with three-site
"cluster" terms hosting a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ SPT phase. Focusing on the weakly
interacting regime, we find that eigenstates with volume-law entanglement coexist with area-law
entangled eigenstates throughout the spectrum. We show that a subset of the latter can be constructed
by virtue of repeated cluster excitations on the even or odd sublattice of the chain, resulting in
an equidistant "tower" of states, analogous to the phenomenology of quantum many-body scars. We
further demonstrate that these scarred eigenstates support nonthermal expectation values of
local cluster operators in the bulk and exhibit signatures of topological order even at finite energy
densities. Studying the dynamics for out-of-equilibrium states drawn from the noninteracting
"cluster basis", we unveil that nonthermalizing bulk dynamics can be observed on long time scales
if clusters on odd and even sites are energetically detuned. In this case, cluster excitations remain
essentially confined to one of the two sublattices such that inhomogeneous cluster configurations
cannot equilibrate and thermalization of the full system is impeded. Our work sheds light on the
role of quantum many-body scars in preserving SPT order at finite temperature and the possibility
of coherent bulk dynamics in models with SPT order beyond the existence of long-lived edge modes.

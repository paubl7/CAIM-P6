Quantum dynamics of coherent states is studied within quantum field theory using two complementary
methods: by organizing the evolution as a Taylor series in elapsed time and by perturbative expansion
in coupling within the interaction-picture formalism. One of the important aspects of our analysis
consists in utilizing the operators and the vacuum of interacting theory in constructing the states,
without invoking asymptotic particles. Focusing on a coherent state describing a spatially homogeneous
field configuration, it is demonstrated that both adopted methods successfully account for nonlinear
classical dynamics, giving distinguishable quantum effects. In particular, according to the
time-expansion analysis the initial field-acceleration, with which the field departs from its
initial expectation value, is governed by the tree-level potential with renormalized mass and
bare coupling constant. The interaction-picture computation, instead, can be manipulated to
give the nonlinear dynamics, determined in terms of renormalized coupling and mass. However, it
results in a logarithmic initial-time singularity in the field-acceleration, reminiscent of
the similar behaviour encountered within semi-classical formalism, for certain choices of the
initial state for fluctuations. Within our coherent-state analysis, the above mentioned peculiarities
are artefacts of an expansion: in the first case over infinitesimal time, while in the second case
in the coupling constant. Despite this, we show that the evolution obtained within the interaction-picture
analysis is valid for extended period of time. Moreover, on top of the desired classical dynamics,
it serves us with interesting quantum corrections, previously proposed by Dvali-Gomez-Zell.

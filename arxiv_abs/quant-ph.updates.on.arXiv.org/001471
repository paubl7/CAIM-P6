We propose a reinterpretation and reformulation of the single-particle Green's function in nonrelativistic
quantum many-body theory with an emphasis on normalization. By downfolding a correlation function
covering all of Fock space into the observable portion, we derive a nonlocal Dyson equation which
depends on an unknown downfolding frequency. The downfolding frequency is determined by solving
the inverse problem so that the spectral function of the single-particle propagator is a Dirac-$\delta$
function. Upon measurement, the system collapses stochastically onto one of these normalized
solutions. This collapse has a nonlocal effect on the path the particle takes, in agreement with
quantum entanglement. We postulate that the multiplicity of each quantized solution is directly
related to the ensemble averaged spectrum and the entropy created by measurement of the particle.
In the final part, we outline a new picture of dynamics in quantum many-body systems. As a function
of the coupling strength, the multiplicity for collapse has a complicated form due to the shape of
the quantization condition. This structure creates an entropic force from counting quantized
solutions which is predominantly attractive but likely also has a narrow repulsive regime at weak
coupling. Upon collapse, an internal spacetime forms between the two points in order to carry the
information gained from the reduction of the probabilistic many-body state. The repeated creation
of these spacetime bridges defines an internal spacetime with a complicated shape and history.
We treat the quantum system as a finite informational resource that holds information about possible
normalized outcomes, collapses the wave function to reset after encountering a conflict, and creates
an internal spacetime to carry the information gained with every collapse.

We introduce and study a certain discrete probability distribution $P_{n,m,k,l}$ having non-negative
integer parameters $n,m,k,l$, motivated by the asymmetry problem in quantum information theory.
Its analysis reveals the number of orthogonal vectors among permuted vectors of the tensor product
of asymmetric and invariant vectors. The distribution is defined by irreducible decomposition
of the tensor product $\Xi_{n,m|k,l}$ of a certain asymmetric state and the Dicke state in the $\operatorname{SU}(2)$-$\mathfrak{S}_n$-bimodule
$(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}$ appearing in the classical Schur-Weyl duality. We derive several
explicit formulas of the probability mass function $p(x)=p(x|n,m,k,l)$ involving hypergeometric
orthogonal polynomials via representation theoretic methods. Among them, Racah presentation
is the most remarkable and useful formula, which expresses the pmf $p(x)$ by a single Racah polynomial.
We also derive a formula expressing the cumulative distribution function in terms of a terminating
${}_4 F_3$-hypergeometric series. Using these explicit formulas, we study asymptotic behavior
of $P_{n,m,k,l}$ in two types of limit $n \to \infty$. In the first limit, we fix $k$, $l$ and $m/n$,
and show that the asymptotic discrete distribution is the convolution of two binomial distributions.
In the second limit, we fix $m/n$, $k/n$ and $l/n$, and prove the central limit theorem of $P_{n,m,k,l}$,
of which the limit normal distribution is derived by the three-term recurrence relation of $p(x)$
coming from that of Racah polynomial. We also describe the asymptotic behavior of the expectation
and the variance beyond the central limit theorem. Based on these asymptotic analysis, we discuss
the degree of asymmetry of the tensor product state $\Xi_{n,m|k,l}$. In the appendix, we discuss
$\mathbf{q}$-analogue of the computations on $P_{n,m,k,l}$.

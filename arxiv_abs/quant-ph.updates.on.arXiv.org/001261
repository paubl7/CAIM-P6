We have recently proposed a Lagrangian in trace dynamics at the Planck scale, for unification of
gravitation, Yang-Mills fields, and fermions. Dynamical variables are described by odd-grade
(fermionic) and even-grade (bosonic) Grassmann matrices. Evolution takes place in Connes time.
At energies much lower than Planck scale, trace dynamics reduces to quantum field theory. In the
present paper we explain that the correct understanding of spin requires us to formulate the theory
in 8-D octonionic space. The automorphisms of the octonion algebra, which belong to the smallest
exceptional Lie group $G_2$, replace space-time diffeomorphisms and internal gauge transformations,
bringing them under a common unified fold. Building on earlier work by other researchers on division
algebras, we propose the Lorentz-weak unification at the Planck scale, the symmetry group being
the stabiliser group of the quaternions inside the octonions. This is one of the two maximal subgroups
of $G_2$, the other one being $SU(3)$, the element preserver group of octonions. This latter group,
coupled with $U(1)_{em}$, describes the electro-colour symmetry, as shown earlier by Furey. We
predict a new massless spin one boson [the Lorentz boson] which should be looked for in experiments.
Our Lagrangian correctly describes three fermion generations, through three copies of the group
$G_2$, embedded in the exceptional Lie group $F_4$. This is the unification group for the four fundamental
interactions, and it also happens to be the automorphism group of the exceptional Jordan algebra.
Gravitation is shown to be an emergent classical phenomenon. Whereas at the Planck scale, there
is present a quantised version of the Lorentz symmetry, mediated by the Lorentz boson. We argue that
at sub-Planck scales, the self-adjoint part of the octonionic trace dynamics bears a relationship
with string theory in eleven dimensions.

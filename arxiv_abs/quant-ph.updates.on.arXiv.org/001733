Usually duality process keeps energy spectrum invariant. In this paper, we provide a duality, which
keeps entanglement spectrum invariant, in order to diagnose quantum entanglement of non-Hermitian
non-interacting fermionic systems. We limit our attention to non-Hermitian systems with a complete
set of biorthonormal eigenvectors and an entirely real energy spectrum. The original system has
a reduced density matrix $\rho_\mathrm{o}$ and the real space is partitioned via a projecting operator
$\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm o}$. After dualization, we obtain a new reduced density matrix $\rho_{\mathrm{d}}$
and a new real space projector $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm d}$. Remarkably, entanglement spectrum
and entanglement entropy keep invariant. Inspired by the duality, we defined two types of non-Hermitian
models, upon $\mathcal R_{\mathrm{o}}$ is given. In type-I exemplified by the ``non-reciprocal
model'', there exists at least one duality such that $\rho_{\mathrm{d}}$ is Hermitian. In other
words, entanglement information of type-I non-Hermitian models with a given $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{o}}$
is entirely controlled by Hermitian models with $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{d}}$. As a result, we are
allowed to apply known results of Hermitian systems to efficiently obtain entanglement properties
of type-I models. On the other hand, the duals of type-II models, exemplified by ``non-Hermitian
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model'', are always non-Hermitian. For the practical purpose, the duality
provides a potentially \textit{efficient} computation route to entanglement of non-Hermitian
systems. Via connecting different models, the duality also sheds lights on either trivial or nontrivial
role of non-Hermiticity played in quantum entanglement, paving the way to potentially systematic
classification and characterization of non-Hermitian systems from the entanglement perspective.

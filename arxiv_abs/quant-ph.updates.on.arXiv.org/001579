The extension of many-body quantum dynamics to the non-unitary domain has led to a series of exciting
developments, including new out-of-equilibrium entanglement phases and phase transitions.
We show how a duality transformation between space and time on one hand, and unitarity and non-unitarity
on the other, can be used to realize steady state phases of non-unitary dynamics that exhibit a rich
variety of behavior in their entanglement scaling with subsystem size -- from logarithmic to extensive
to \emph{fractal}. We show how these outcomes in non-unitary circuits (that are "spacetime-dual"
to unitary circuits) relate to the growth of entanglement in time in the corresponding unitary circuits,
and how they differ, through an exact mapping to a problem of unitary evolution with boundary decoherence,
in which information gets "radiated away" from one edge of the system. In spacetime-duals of chaotic
unitary circuits, this mapping allows us to uncover a non-thermal volume-law entangled phase with
a logarithmic correction to the entropy distinct from other known examples. Most notably, we also
find novel steady state phases with \emph{fractal} entanglement scaling, $S(\ell) \sim \ell^{\alpha}$
with tunable $0 < \alpha < 1$ for subsystems of size $\ell$ in one dimension. These fractally entangled
states add a qualitatively new entry to the families of many-body quantum states that have been studied
as energy eigenstates or dynamical steady states, whose entropy almost always displays either
area-law, volume-law or logarithmic scaling. We also present an experimental protocol for preparing
these novel steady states with only a very limited amount of postselection via a type of "teleportation"
between spacelike and timelike slices of quantum circuits.

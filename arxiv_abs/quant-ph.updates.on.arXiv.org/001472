Quantum Hall states - the progenitors of the growing family of topological insulators -- are rich
source of exotic quantum phases. The nature of these states is reflected in the gapless edge modes,
which in turn can be classified as integer - carrying electrons, fractional - carrying fractional
charges; and neutral - carrying excitations with zero net charge but a well-defined amount of heat.
The latter two may obey anyonic statistics, which can be abelian or non-abelian. The most-studied
putative non-abelian state is the spin-polarized filling factor {\nu}=5/2, whose charge e/4 quasiparticles
are accompanied by neutral modes. This filling, however, permits different possible topological
orders, which can be abelian or non-abelian. While numerical calculations favor the non-abelian
anti-Pfaffian (A-Pf) order to have the lowest energy, recent thermal conductance measurements
suggested the experimentally realized order to be the particle-hole Pfaffian (PH-Pf) order. It
has been suggested that lack of thermal equilibration among the different edge modes of the A-Pf
order can account for this discrepancy. The identification of the topological order is crucial
for the interpretation of braiding (interference) operations, better understanding of the thermal
equilibration process, and the reliability of the numerical studies. We developed a new method
that helps identifying the topological order of the {\nu}=5/2 state. By creating an interface between
the two 2D half-planes, one hosting the {\nu}=5/2 state and the other an integer {\nu}=3 state, the
interface supported a fractional {\nu}=1/2 charge mode with 1/2 quantum conductance and a neutral
Majorana mode. The presence of the Majorana mode, probed by measuring noise, propagating in the
opposite direction to the charge mode, asserted the presence of the PH-Pf order but not that of the
A-Pf order.

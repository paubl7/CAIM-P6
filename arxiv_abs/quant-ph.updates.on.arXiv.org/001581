Useful fault-tolerant quantum computers require very large numbers of physical qubits. Quantum
computers are often designed as arrays of static qubits executing gates and measurements. Photonic
qubits require a different approach. In photonic fusion-based quantum computing (FBQC), the main
hardware components are resource-state generators (RSGs) and fusion devices connected via waveguides
and switches. RSGs produce small entangled states of a few photonic qubits, whereas fusion devices
perform entangling measurements between different resource states, thereby executing computations.
In addition, low-loss photonic delays such as optical fiber can be used as fixed-time quantum memories
simultaneously storing thousands of photonic qubits. Here, we present a modular architecture
for FBQC in which these components are combined to form "interleaving modules" consisting of one
RSG with its associated fusion devices and a few fiber delays. Exploiting the multiplicative power
of delays, each module can add thousands of physical qubits to the computational Hilbert space.
Networks of modules are universal fault-tolerant quantum computers, which we demonstrate using
surface codes and lattice surgery as a guiding example. Our numerical analysis shows that in a network
of modules containing 1-km-long fiber delays, each RSG can generate four logical distance-35 surface-code
qubits while tolerating photon loss rates above 2% in addition to the fiber-delay loss. We illustrate
how the combination of interleaving with further uses of non-local fiber connections can reduce
the cost of logical operations and facilitate the implementation of unconventional geometries
such as periodic boundaries or stellated surface codes. Interleaving applies beyond purely optical
architectures, and can also turn many small disconnected matter-qubit devices with transduction
to photons into a large-scale quantum computer.

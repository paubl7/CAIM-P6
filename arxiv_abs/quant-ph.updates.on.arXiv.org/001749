Recently, there has been intense research in proposing and developing various methods for constructing
high-order exceptional points (EPs) in dissipative systems. These EPs can possess a number of intriguing
properties related to, e.g., chiral transport and enhanced sensitivity. Previous proposals to
realize non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) with high-order EPs have been mainly based on either
direct construction of spatial networks of coupled modes or utilization of synthetic dimensions,
e.g., of mapping spatial lattices to time or photon-number space. Both methods rely on the construction
of effective NHHs describing classical or postselected quantum fields, which neglect the effects
of quantum jumps, and which, thus, suffer from a scalability problem in the {\it quantum regime},
when the probability of quantum jumps increases with the number of excitations and dissipation
rate. Here, by considering the full quantum dynamics of a quadratic Liouvillian superoperator,
we introduce a simple and effective method for engineering NHHs with high-order quantum EPs, derived
from evolution matrices of system operators moments. That is, by quantizing higher-order moments
of system operators, e.g., of a quadratic two-mode system, the resulting evolution matrices can
be interpreted as alternative NHHs describing, e.g., a spatial lattice of coupled resonators,
where spatial sites are represented by high-order field moments in the synthetic space of field
moments. As an example, we consider a $U(1)$-symmetric quadratic Liouvillian describing a {\it
bimodal} cavity with incoherent mode coupling, which can also possess anti-$\cal PT$-symmetry,
whose field moment dynamics can be mapped to an NHH governing a spatial {\it network} of coupled resonators
with high-order EPs.

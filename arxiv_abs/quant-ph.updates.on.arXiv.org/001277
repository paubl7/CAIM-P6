In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, solving the electronic structure problem
from chemistry is considered as the "killer application" for near-term quantum devices. In spite
of the success of variational hybrid quantum/classical algorithms in providing accurate energy
profiles for small molecules, careful considerations are still required for the description of
complicated features of potential energy surfaces. Because the current quantum resources are
very limited, it is common to focus on a restricted part of the Hilbert space (determined by the set
of active orbitals). While physically motivated, this approximation can severely impact the description
of these complicated features. A perfect example is that of conical intersections (i.e. a singular
point of degeneracy between electronic states), which are of primary importance to understand
many prominent reactions. Designing active spaces so that the improved accuracy from a quantum
computer is not rendered useless is key to finding useful applications of these promising devices
within the field of chemistry. To answer this issue, we introduce a NISQ-friendly method called
"State-Averaged Orbital-Optimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver" (SA-OO-VQE) which combines
two algorithms: (1) a state-averaged orbital-optimizer, and (2) a state-averaged VQE. To demonstrate
the success of the method, we classically simulate it on a minimal Schiff base model (namely the formaldimine
molecule CH2NH) relevant also for the photoisomerization in rhodopsin -- a crucial step in the process
of vision mediated by the presence of a conical intersection. We show that merging both algorithms
fulfil the necessary condition to describe the molecule's conical intersection, i.e. the ability
to treat degenerate (or quasi-degenerate) states on the same footing.

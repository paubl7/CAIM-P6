Knowledge on evolving physical fields is of paramount importance in science, technology, and economics.
Dynamical field inference (DFI) addresses the problem of reconstructing a stochastically driven,
dynamically evolving field from finite data. It relies on information field theory (IFT), the information
theory for fields. Here, the relations of DFI, IFT, and the recently developed supersymmetric theory
of stochastics (STS) are established in a pedagogical discussion. In IFT, field expectation values
can be calculated from the partition function of the full space-time inference problem. The partition
function of the inference problem invokes a functional Dirac function to guarantee the dynamics,
as well as a field-dependent functional determinant, to establish proper normalization, both
impeding the necessary evaluation of the path integral over all field configurations. STS replaces
these problematic expressions via the introduction of fermionic ghost and bosonic Lagrange fields,
respectively. The action of these fields has a supersymmetry, which means there exists an exchange
operation between bosons and fermions that leaves the system invariant. In contrast to this, measurements
of the dynamical fields do not adhere to this supersymmetry. The supersymmetry can also be broken
spontaneously, in which case the system evolves chaotically. This affects the predictability
of the system and thereby make DFI more challenging. We investigate the interplay of measurement
constraints with the non-linear chaotic dynamics of a simplified, illustrative system with the
help of Feynman diagrams and show that the Fermionic corrections are essential to obtain the correct
posterior statistics over system trajectories.

In early days of navigation over sea and ocean it has been considered that when a ship, governed by
waves, arrives as some critical distance of the global character, then this ship must absolute collapse,
i.e. must fall in the nothing. Only remarkable Magellan voyage definitely "experimentally" realized
proof that there is no absolute collapse of the ship trajectory on the ocean, that different collapses
of the ship trajectories have always less or more local character, and, that only spherical-symmetric
form of the Earth has absolute character. Within standard quantum mechanical formalism collapse
by measurement, i.e. detection must be postulated independently of the unitary symmetric (that
conserves superposition or entanglement) quantum mechanical dynamics since to this day there
is no realized experiment on the existence of the entanglement between quantum system and detector
(Schrodinger cat effect). In this work we suggest an original, realistic and simple, form of the
experiment of interference of single photon at beam splitter. Here quantum entanglement between
photon and photon trajectories detector (which corresponds to single simple two-level system,
practically single atom) is studied. (All this is equivalent to elementary processes within typical
gas laser tube and in this sense suggested entanglement can be considered even experimentally verified.)
It admits model of the collapse by detection as the spontaneous breaking of the unitary symmetry
of quantum mechanical dynamics as an especial case of the general formalism of the spontaneous symmetry
breaking. Collapse represents an effective,local phenomena, while unitary symmetry represents
an absolute exact, global phenomena. It can be extremely important for the quantum mechanics foundation.

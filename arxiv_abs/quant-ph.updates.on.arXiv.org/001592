Quantum annealing aims at finding optimal solutions to complex optimization problems using a suitable
quantum many body Hamiltonian encoding the solution in the ground state. To find the solution one
typically evolves the ground state of a simple initial Hamiltonian adiabatically to the ground
state of the designated final Hamiltonian. Here we explore whether and when a full quantum representation
of the dynamics leads to a higher probability to end up in the desired ground when compared to a classical
mean field approximation. As a simple but nontrivial example, we target the ground state of interacting
bosons trapped in a tight binding lattice with a small local defect by turning on long range interactions.
Already two atoms in four sites interacting via two cavity modes prove complex enough to exhibit
significant differences between the full quantum model and a mean field approximation for the cavity
fields mediating the interactions. We find a large parameter region of highly successful quantum
annealing, where the semi-classical approach largely fails. Here we see strong evidence for the
importance of entanglement to end close to the optimal solution. The quantum model also reduces
the minimal time for a high target occupation probability. Maybe surprisingly, different numerical
cut-offs of the Hilbert space reveal an improved performance for lower cut-offs, i.e. a nonphysical
reduced Hilbert space, at short simulated times. Hence a less faithful representation of the full
quantum dynamics sometimes creates a higher success probability in an even shorter time. However,
a sufficiently high cut-off proves relevant to obtain near perfect fidelity for long simulated
times. Overall our results exhibit a clear improvement to find the optimal solution based on a quantum
model versus simulations based on a classical field approximation.

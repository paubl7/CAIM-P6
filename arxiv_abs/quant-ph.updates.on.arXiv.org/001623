The relations between the resource theoretic measures of quantum coherence are rigorously investigated
for various Markovian and non-Markovian channels for the two-qubit $X$ states with specific attention
to the maximum and minimum attainable coherence and usefulness of these states in performing quantum
teleportation in noisy environment. The investigation has revealed that under both dephasing
and dissipative type noises the maximally entangled mixed states and Werner states lose their form
and usefulness. However, maximally non-local mixed states (MNMSs) lose their identity in dissipative
noise only. Thus, MNMSs are established to be useful in teleporting a qubit with fidelity greater
than the classical limit in the presence of dephasing noise. MNMSs also remain useful for device
independent quantum key distribution in this case as they still violate Bell's inequality. In the
presence of noise, coherence measured by relative entropy of coherence is found to fall faster than
the same measured using $l_1$ norm of coherence. Further, information back-flow from the environment
to the system is observed over non-Markovian channels which leads to revival in coherence. Additionally,
sequential interaction of two qubits with the same environment is found to result in correlated
noise on both qubits, and coherence is observed to be frozen in this case under dephasing channel.
Under the effect of Markovian and non-Markovian dephasing channels studied here, we observed that
MNMSs have maximum relative coherence, i.e., they have the maximum amount of $l_1$ norm of coherence
among the states with the same amount of relative entropy of coherence. However, this feature is
not visible in any $X$ state evolving over dissipative channels.

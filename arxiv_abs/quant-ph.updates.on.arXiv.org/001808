Simulated quantum annealing based on the path-integral Monte Carlo is one of the most common tools
to simulate quantum annealing on classical hardware. Nevertheless, it is in principle highly non-trivial
whether or not this classical algorithm can correctly reproduce the quantum dynamics of quantum
annealing, particularly in the diabatic regime. We study this problem numerically through the
generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism of defect distribution in the simplest ferromagnetic one-dimensional
transverse-field Ising model with and without coupling to the environment. We find that,in the
absence of coupling to the environment, simulated quantum annealing correctly describes the annealing-time
dependence of the average number of defects, but a detailed analysis of the defect distribution
shows clear deviations from the theoretical prediction. When the system is open (coupled to the
environment), the average number of defects does not follow the theoretical prediction but is qualitatively
compatible with the numerical result by the infinite time-evolving block decimation combined
with the quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral, which is valid in a very short time region. The
distribution of defects in the open system turns out to be not far from the theoretical prediction.
It is surprising that the classical stochastic dynamics of simulated quantum annealing ostensibly
reproduce some aspects of the quantum dynamics. However, a serious problem is that it is hard to predict
for which physical quantities in which system it is reliable. Those results suggest the necessity
to exert a good amount of caution in using simulated quantum annealing to study the detailed quantitative
aspects of the dynamics of quantum annealing.

A metal can be driven to an insulating phase through distinct mechanisms. A possible way is via the
Coulomb interaction, which then defines the Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT). Another possibility
is the MIT driven by disorder, the so-called Anderson MIT. Here we analyze interacting particles
in disordered Hubbard chains $-$ thus comprising the Mott-Anderson physics $-$ by investigating
the ground-state entanglement with density functional theory. The localization signature on
entanglement is found to be a local minimum at a certain critical density. Individually, the Mott
(Anderson) MIT has a single critical density whose minimum entanglement decreases as the interaction
(disorder) enhances. While in the Mott MIT entanglement saturates at finite values, characterizing
partial localization, in the Anderson MIT the system reaches full localization, with zero entanglement,
for sufficiently strong disorder. In the combined Mott-Anderson MIT, we find three critical densities
referring to local minima on entanglement. One of them is the same as for the Anderson MIT, but now
the presence of interaction requires a stronger disorder potential to induce localization. A second
critical density is related to the Mott MIT, but due to disorder it is displaced by a factor proportional
to the concentration of impurities. The third local minimum on entanglement is unique to the concomitant
presence of disorder and interaction, found to be related to an effective density phenomenon, thus
referred to as a Mott-like MIT. Since entanglement has been intrinsically connected to the magnetic
susceptibility $-$ a quantity promptly available in cold atoms experiments $-$ our detailed numerical
description might be useful for the experimental investigation of Mott-Anderson MIT.

Optically addressable paramagnetic defects in wide-band-gap semiconductors are promising platforms
for quantum communications and sensing. The presence of avoided crossings between the electronic
levels of these defects can substantially alter their quantum dynamics and be both detrimental
and beneficial for quantum information applications. Avoided crossings give rise to clock transitions,
which can significantly improve protection from magnetic noise and favorably increase coherence
time. However, the reduced coupling between electronic and nuclear spins at an avoided crossing
may be detrimental to applications where nuclear spins act as quantum memories. Here we present
a combined theoretical and experimental study of the quantum dynamics of paramagnetic defects
interacting with a nuclear spin bath at avoided crossings. We develop a computational approach
based on a generalization of the cluster expansion technique, which can account for processes beyond
pure dephasing and describe the dynamics of any solid-state spin-qubits near avoided crossings.
Using this approach and experimental validation, we determine the change in nature and source of
noise at avoided crossings for divacancies in SiC. We find that we can condition the clock transition
of the divacancies in SiC on multiple adjacent nuclear spins states. In our experiments, we demonstrate
that one can suppress the effects of fluctuating charge impurities with depletion techniques,
leading to an increased coherence time at clock transition, limited purely by magnetic noise. Combined
with ab-initio predictions of spin Hamiltonian parameters, the proposed theoretical approach
paves the way to designing the coherence properties of spin qubits from first principles.

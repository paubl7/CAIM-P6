We describe a quantum-assisted machine learning (QAML) method in which multivariate data is encoded
into quantum states in a Hilbert space whose dimension is exponentially large in the length of the
data vector. Learning in this space occurs through applying a low-depth quantum circuit with a tree
tensor network (TTN) topology, which acts as an unsupervised feature extractor to identify the
most relevant quantum states in a data-driven fashion. This unsupervised feature extractor then
feeds a supervised linear classifier and encodes the output in a small-dimensional quantum register.
In contrast to previous work on \emph{quantum-inspired} TTN classifiers, in which the embedding
map and class decision weights did not map the data to well-defined quantum states, we present an
approach that can be implemented on gate-based quantum computing devices. In particular, we identify
an embedding map with accuracy similar to exponential machines (Novikov \emph{et al.}, arXiv:1605.03795),
but which produces valid quantum states from classical data vectors, and utilize manifold-based
gradient optimization schemes to produce isometric operations mapping quantum states to a register
of qubits defining a class decision. We detail methods for efficiently obtaining one- and two-point
correlation functions of the decision boundary vectors of the quantum model, which can be used for
model interpretability, as well as methods for obtaining classifications from partial data vectors.
Further, we show that the use of isometric tensors can significantly aid in the human interpretability
of the correlation functions extracted from the decision weights, and may produce models that are
less susceptible to adversarial perturbations. We demonstrate our methodologies in applications
utilizing the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and a multivariate timeseries dataset of human activity
recognition.

Measurement in classical physics is examined here as a process involving the joint evolution of
object-system and measuring apparatus. For this, a model of measurement is proposed which lends
itself to theoretical analysis using Hamiltonian mechanics and Bayesian probability. At odds
with a widely-held intuition, it is found that the ideal measurement capable of extracting finite
information without disturbing the system is ruled out (by the third law of thermodynamics). And
in its place a Heisenberg-like precision-disturbance relation is found, with the role of $\hbar/2$
played by $k_BT/\Omega$; where $T$ and $\Omega$ are a certain temperature and frequency characterizing
the ready-state of the apparatus. The proposed model is argued to be maximally efficient, in that
it saturates this Heisenberg-like inequality, while various modifications of the model fail to
saturate it. The process of continuous measurement is then examined; yielding a novel pair of Liouville-like
master equations -- according to whether the measurement record is read or discarded -- describing
the dynamics of (a rational agent's knowledge of) a system under continuous measurement. The master
equation corresponding to discarded record doubles as a description of an open thermodynamic system.
The fine-grained Shannon entropy is found to be a Lyapunov function (i.e. $\dot S\geq0$) of the dynamics
when the record is discarded, providing a novel H-theorem suitable for studying the second law and
non-equilibrium statistical physics. These findings may also be of interest to those working on
the foundations of quantum mechanics, in particular along the lines of attempting to identify and
unmix a possible epistemic component of quantum theory from its ontic content. More practically,
these results may find applications in the fields of precision measurement, nanoengineering and
molecular machines.

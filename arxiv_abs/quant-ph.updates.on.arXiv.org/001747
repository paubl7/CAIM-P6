The delocalization or scrambling of quantum information has emerged as a central ingredient in
the understanding of thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems. Recently, significant
progress has been made analytically by modeling non-integrable systems as stochastic systems,
lacking a Hamiltonian picture, while honest Hamiltonian dynamics are frequently limited to small
system sizes due to computational constraints. In this paper, we address this by investigating
the role of conservation laws (including energy conservation) in the thermalization process from
an information-theoretic perspective. For general non-integrable models, we use the equilibrium
approximation to show that the maximal amount of information is scrambled (as measured by the tripartite
mutual information of the time-evolution operator) at late times even when a system conserves energy.
In contrast, we explicate how when a system has additional symmetries that lead to degeneracies
in the spectrum, the amount of information scrambled must decrease. This general theory is exemplified
in case studies of holographic conformal field theories (CFTs) and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK)
model. Due to the large Virasoro symmetry in 1+1D CFTs, we argue that, in a sense, these holographic
theories are not maximally chaotic, which is explicitly seen by the non-saturation of the second
R\'enyi tripartite mutual information. The roles of particle-hole and U(1) symmetries in the SYK
model are milder due to the degeneracies being only two-fold, which we confirm explicitly at both
large- and small-$N$. We reinterpret the operator entanglement in terms the growth of local operators,
connecting our results with the information scrambling described by out-of-time-ordered correlators,
identifying the mechanism for suppressed scrambling from the Heisenberg perspective.

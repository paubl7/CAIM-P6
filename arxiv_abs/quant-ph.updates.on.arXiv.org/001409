Entanglement transitions in quantum dynamics present a novel class of phase transitions in non-equilibrium
systems. When a many-body quantum system undergoes hybrid quantum dynamics, consisting of unitary
evolution interspersed with monitored random measurements, the steady-state can exhibit a phase
transition between volume- and area-law entanglement. The role of dimension in the nature of these
transitions is an open problem. There is a dimensional correspondence between measurement-induced
transitions in non-unitary quantum circuits in $d$ spatial dimensions and classical statistical
mechanical models in $d+1$ dimensions, where the time dimension in the quantum problem is mapped
to a spatial dimension in the classical model. In this work we show that the role of dimension is considerably
richer by unveiling a form of `dimensional hybridity': critical properties of the steady-state
entanglement are governed by a combination of exponents consistent with $d$-dimensional percolation
and $(d+1)$-dimensional percolation. We uncover this dimensional hybridity in 1+1D and 2+1D circuits
using a graph-state based simulation algorithm where the entanglement structure is encoded in
an underlying graph, providing access to the geometric structure of entanglement. We locate the
critical point using the tripartite information, revealing area-law entanglement scaling at
criticality, and showing that the entanglement transition coincides with the purification transition.
The emergence of this `dimensional hybridity' in these non-unitary quantum circuits sheds new
light on the universality of measurement-induced transitions, and opens the way for analyzing
the quantum error correcting properties of random unitary circuits in higher dimensions.

Levitated systems are desirable due to reduced clamping losses and reduced thermal contact. These
advantageous properties have been exploited in optomechanics to achieve ultra-strong coupling
between the mechanical mode and the electromagnetic mode. Such schemes provide an opportunity
for the quantum manipulation of a macroscopic system. In this letter, we report the first successful
experiments with a levitated millimeter-scale neodymium magnet within a centimeter-scale superconducting
aluminum coaxial quarter-wave stub cavity. The magnet levitated near the top of the stub, where
the electric field is concentrated, perturbs the electric field distribution allowing for small
perturbations in the magnet's position to be detected through shifts in the resonance frequency.
Resonance spectra are collected via a vector network analyzer (VNA) between temperatures of 5 K
and 50 mK revealing movement of the magnet inside of the cavity. Room temperature measurements and
finite element calculations are done to calculate the shift in frequency for various positions
of the magnet, and an experimentally measured 100 MHz upshift when transitioning into a superconducting
state confirms levitation with remanences up to 140 times stronger than the critical field of the
aluminum. We achieve levitation heights of 1 - 1.8 mm. We investigate the dependence of levitation
height and levitation temperature on the strength of the magnet and, surprisingly, we observe that
the levitation temperature and height both increase with permanent magnet strength. Our work describes
a novel macroscopic mechanical system capable of sensing and transducing forces, thus allowing
for the coupling of disparate classical and quantum systems.

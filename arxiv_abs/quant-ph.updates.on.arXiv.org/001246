Current, near-term quantum devices have shown great progress in recent years culminating with
a demonstration of quantum supremacy. In the medium-term, however, quantum machines will need
to transition to greater reliability through error correction, likely through promising techniques
such as surface codes which are well suited for near-term devices with limited qubit connectivity.
We discover quantum memory, particularly resonant cavities with transmon qubits arranged in a
2.5D architecture, can efficiently implement surface codes with substantial hardware savings
and performance/fidelity gains. Specifically, we *virtualize logical qubits* by storing them
in layers distributed across qubit memories connected to each transmon. Surprisingly, distributing
each logical qubit across many memories has a minimal impact on fault tolerance and results in substantially
more efficient operations. Our design permits fast transversal CNOT operations between logical
qubits sharing the same physical address which are 6x faster than lattice surgery CNOTs. We develop
a novel embedding which saves ~10x in transmons with another 2x from an additional optimization
for compactness. Although Virtualized Logical Qubits (VLQ) pays a 10x penalty in serialization,
advantages in the transversal CNOT and area efficiency result in performance comparable to 2D transmon-only
architectures. Our simulations show fault tolerance comparable to 2D architectures while saving
substantial hardware. Furthermore, VLQ can produce magic states 1.22x faster for a fixed number
of transmon qubits. This is a critical benchmark for future fault-tolerant quantum computers.
VLQ substantially reduces the hardware requirements for fault tolerance and puts within reach
a proof-of-concept experimental demonstration of around 10 logical qubits, requiring only 11
transmons and 9 attached cavities in total.

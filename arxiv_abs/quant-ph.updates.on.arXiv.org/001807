We examine the internal structure of two-mode entanglement criteria for quadrature and number-phase
squeezed states. (i) We first address entanglement criteria obtained via partial transpose of
Schrodinger-Robertson inequality, where presence of an extra term makes them stronger. We show
that this extra term performs an optimization within two intra-mode rotations, for the variables
mixing in the entanglement criterion. We demonstrate this situation both for quadrature and number-phase
squeezed states. (ii) We realize that Simon's criterion performs this optimization automatically.
(iii) Hence, we derive a Simon-like criterion for number-phase squeezed states which performs
this optimization in the number-phase plane. The method can be generalized also for other states,
e.g., amplitude-squeezed states. In addition to examining the intra-mode rotations, (iv) we also
present an entanglement scheme in terms of product of the noises of the two modes, i.e., noise-area.
We question, analytically and numerically, whether the well-known entanglement criteria are
actually search mechanisms for a noise-area below unity. In this regard, we also numerically show
the following. We consider an entangled state. We minimize the noise-area for the product form of
the Duan-Giedke-Cirac-Zoller criterion (Mancini {\it et. al.}) with respect to the intra-mode
rotations. We observe that this noise-area (actually) is the input nonclassicality that a beam-splitter
necessitates in order to generate exactly the amount of entanglement our particular state possesses.
(vi) Additionally, we define an alternative entanglement measure for Gaussian states which can
also be adapted to multimode entanglement. We further raise some intriguing questions, e.g., on
the existence of an easier definition of an entanglement depth for number-phase squeezed states.

A coherent transmission methodology for a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD)
system based on quantum-heterodyne measurement through a coherent intradyne receiver is experimentally
demonstrated in the framework of 5G mobile fronthaul links. Continuous optical carrier synchronization
is obtained through training information, which is multiplexing to the quantum signal as pilot
tone in both, frequency and polarization. Spectral tailoring by means of optical carrier suppression
and single-sideband modulation is adopted to simultaneously mitigate crosstalk into the quantum
channel and self-interference for the pilot tone, thus allowing for a high signal-to-noise ratio
for this training signal. Frequency offset correction and optical phase estimation for the free-running
local oscillator of the receiver is accurately performed and guarantees low-noise quantum signal
reception at high symbol rates of 250 MHz and 500 MHz with additional Nyquist pulse shaping. A low
excess noise in the order of 0.1% to 0.5% of shot-noise units is obtained for fiber-based transmission
over a fronthaul link reach of 13.2 km. Moreover, co-existence with 11 carrier-grade classical
signals is experimentally investigated. Joint signal transmission in the C-band of both, quantum
signal and classical signals, is successfully demonstrated. Secure-key rates of 18 and 10 Mb/s
are obtained under strict security assumptions, where Eve has control of the receiver noise, for
a dark and a lit fiber link, respectively. Moreover, rates of 85 and 72 Mb/s are resulting for a trusted
receiver scenario. These secure-key rates are well addressing the requirements for time-shared
CV-QKD system in densified 5G radio access networks with cloud-based processing.

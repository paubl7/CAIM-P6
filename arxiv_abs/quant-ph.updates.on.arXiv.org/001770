Quantum information processing exploits non-local functionality that has led to significant
breakthroughs in the successful deployment of quantum mechanical protocols. In this regard, we
address the dynamics of entanglement and coherence for three non-interacting qubits initially
prepared as maximally entangled GHZ-like state coupled with independent classical environments.
Two different Gaussian noises in pure and mixed noisy situations, namely, pure power-law noise,
pure fractional Gaussian noise, power-law noise maximized and fractional Gaussian noise maximized
cases are assumed to characterize the environments. With the help of time-dependent entanglement
witnesses, purity, and decoherence measures, within the full range of parameters, we show that
the current mixed noise cases are more detrimental than pure ones where entanglement and coherence
are found short-lived. The power-law noise phase, in particular, appears to be more flexible and
exploitable for long-term preservation effects. In contrast, we find that in both pure and mixed
noise cases, where entanglement and coherence degrade at a relatively high rate, there is no ultimate
solution for avoiding the detrimental dephasing effects of fractional Gaussian noise. The three-qubit
state becomes disentangled and decoherent within independent classical environments driven
by both pure and mixed Gaussian noises, either in long or short interaction time. In addition, due
to the lack of the entanglement revival phenomenon, there is no information exchange between the
system and the environment. The three-qubit GHZ-like states have thus been realized to be an excellent
resource for long enough quantum correlations, coherence, and quantum information preservation
in classical independent channels driven by pure power-law noise with extremely low parameter
values.

Almost all of the entropy in the universe is in the form of Bekenstein--Hawking (BH) entropy of super-massive
black holes. This entropy, if it satisfies Boltzmann's equation $S=\log{\cal N}$, hence represents
almost all the accessible phase space of the Universe, somehow associated to objects which themselves
fill out a very small fraction of ordinary three-dimensional space. Although time scales are very
long, it is believed that black holes will eventually evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation,
which is thermal when counted mode by mode. A pure quantum state collapsing to a black hole will hence
eventually re-emerge as a state with strictly positive entropy, which constitutes the famous black
hole information paradox. Expanding on a remark by Hawking we posit that BH entropy is a thermodynamic
entropy, which must be distinguished from information-theoretic entropy. The paradox can then
be explained by information return in Hawking radiation. The novel perspective advanced here is
that if BH entropy counts the number of accessible physical states in a quantum black hole, then the
paradox can be seen as an instance of the fundamental problem of statistical mechanics. We suggest
a specific analogy to the increase of the entropy in a solvation process. We further show that the
huge phase volume (${\cal N}$), which must be made available to the universe in a gravitational collapse,
cannot originate from the entanglement between ordinary matter and/or radiation inside and outside
the black hole. We argue that, instead, the quantum degrees of freedom of the gravitational field
must get activated near the singularity, resulting in a final state of the `entangled entanglement'
form involving both matter and gravity.

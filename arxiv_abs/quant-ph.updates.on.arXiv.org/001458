We propose to take advantage of the weak coupling of ground-helium 3 nuclear spin to its environment
to produce long-lived macroscopic quantum states, nuclear spin squeezed states, in a vapor cell
at room temperature. To perform a quantum non-destructive measurement of a transverse component
of the polarized collective nuclear spin, we maintain a population in helium 3 metastable state
with a discharge. The collective spin associated to $F=1/2$ metastable level hybridizes with the
ground state one by metastability exchange collisions. To access nuclear spin fluctuations, one
continuously measures the light leaking out of an optical cavity, where it has interacted dispersively
with the metastable state collective spin. In a three coupled collective spin model (nuclear, metastable
and Stokes), we calculate moments of the nuclear spin squeezed component $I_z$ conditioned to the
time averaged optical signal. In the photon counting scheme, the squeezed observable is $I_z^2$
rather than $I_z$. In the homodyne detection scheme, we solve the stochastic equation on the system
state conditioned to the measurement; the conditional expectation value of $I_z$ depends linearly
on the signal and the conditional variance of $I_z$ does not depend on it. The conditional variance
decreases as $(\Gamma_{\rm sq}^{\rm gen}t)^{-1}$, where the squeezing rate $\Gamma_{\rm sq}^{\rm
gen}$ depends linearly on the light intensity in the cavity at weak atom-field coupling and saturates
at strong coupling to the ground state metastability exchange effective rate, proportional to
the metastable atom density. Including de-excitation of metastables on the walls, which induces
nuclear spin decoherence with an effective rate $\gamma_\alpha$, we find a limit $\propto(\gamma_\alpha/\Gamma_{\rm
sq}^{\rm gen})^{1/2}$ on the conditional variance reached in a time $\propto(\gamma_\alpha\Gamma_{\rm
sq}^{\rm gen})^{-1/2}$.

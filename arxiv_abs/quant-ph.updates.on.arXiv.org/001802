Quantum chemistry applications on quantum computers currently rely heavily on the variational
quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. This hybrid quantum-classical algorithm aims at finding
ground state solutions of molecular systems based on the variational principle. VQE calculations
can be systematically implemented for perturbations to each molecular degree of freedom, generating
a Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface (PES) for the molecule. The PES can then be used to derive
thermodynamic properties, which are often desirable for applications in chemical engineering
and materials design. It is clear from this process that quantum chemistry applications contain
a substantial classical computing component in addition to steps that can be performed using a quantum
computer. In order to design efficient work-flows that take full advantage of each hardware-type,
it is critical to consider the entire process so that the high-accuracy electronic energies possible
from quantum computing are not squandered in the process of calculating thermodynamic properties.
We present a summary of the hybrid quantum-classical work-flow to compute thermodynamic properties.
This work-flow contains many options that can significantly affect the efficiency and the accuracy
of the results, including classical optimizer attributes, number of ansatz repetitions, and how
the vibrational Schroedinger equation is solved to determine vibrational modes. We also analyze
the effects of these options by employing robust statistics along with simulations and experiments
on actual quantum hardware. We show that through careful selection of work-flow options, nearly
order-of-magnitude increases in accuracy are possible at equivalent computing time.

Free electron beams such as those employed in electron microscopes have evolved into powerful tools
to investigate photonic nanostructures with an unrivaled combination of spatial and spectral
precision through the analysis of electron energy losses and cathodoluminescence light emission.
In combination with ultrafast optics, the emerging field of ultrafast electron microscopy utilizes
synchronized femtosecond electron and light pulses that are aimed at the sampled structures, holding
the promise to bring simultaneous sub-Angstrom--sub-fs--sub-meV space-time-energy resolution
to the study of materials and optical fields dynamics. Also, these advances enable the manipulation
of the wave function of individual free electrons in unprecedented ways, opening promising prospects
to probe and manipulate quantum excitations at the nanoscale. Here, we provide an overview of photonics
research based on free electrons, we present original theoretical insights, and we discuss several
stimulating challenges and opportunities. In particular, we show that the excitation probability
by a single electron is independent of its wave function, apart from a classical average over the
transverse beam density profile, whereas the probability for two or more modulated electrons depends
on their relative spatial arrangement, thus reflecting the quantum nature of their interactions.
We derive first-principles expressions that embody these results and have general applicability
to shaped electrons and any type of electron-sample interaction. We conclude with some perspectives
on various exciting directions that include disruptive approaches to non-invasive spectroscopy
and microscopy, the possibility of sampling the nonlinear optical response at the nanoscale, the
manipulation of the density matrices associated with free electrons and optical sample modes,
and applications in optical modulation of electron beams.

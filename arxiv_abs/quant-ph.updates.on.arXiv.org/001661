The uncanny ability of multiple particles to interfere with one another is one of the core principles
of quantum mechanics, and serves as foundation for quantum information processing. In particular,
the interplay of constructive and destructive interference with the characteristic exchange
statistics of indistinguishable particles give rise to the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, where
the bunching of bosons can lead to a perfect suppression of two-particle coincidences between the
output ports of a balanced beam splitter. Conversely, in the case of two fermions, anti-bunching
can systematically enhance these coincidences up to twice the baseline value of distinguishable
particles. As such, the respective emergence of dips or peaks in the HOM experiment may at first glance
appear to be indicative of the bosonic/fermionic nature of the incident particles. In this work,
we demonstrate experimentally that the two-particle coincidence statistics of two bosons can
instead be seamlessly tuned from the expected case of suppression to substantial enhancement by
an appropriate choice of the observation basis. To this end, our photonic setting leverages birefringent
polarization couplers to selectively introduce dissipation in the photons polarization degree
of freedom. Notably, the mechanism underpinning this this highly unusual behaviour does not act
on the individual phases accumulated by pairs of particles along specific paths, but instead allows
them to jointly evade losses, while indistinguishable photons are prevented from being simultaneously
detected in orthogonal modes. Our findings reveal a new approach to harnessing non-Hermitian settings
for the manipulation of multi-particle quantum states and as functional elements in quantum simulation
and information processing.

Establishing long-distance quantum entanglement, i.e., entanglement transmission, in quantum
networks (QN) is a key and timely challenge for developing efficient quantum communication. Traditional
comprehension based on classical percolation assumes a necessary condition for successful entanglement
transmission between any two infinitely distant nodes: they must be connected by at least a path
of perfectly entangled states (singlets). Here, we relax this condition by explicitly showing
that one can focus not on optimally converting singlets but on establishing concurrence -- a key
measure of bipartite entanglement. We thereby introduce a new statistical theory, concurrence
percolation theory (ConPT), remotely analogous to classical percolation but fundamentally different,
built by generalizing bond percolation in terms of "sponge-crossing" paths instead of clusters.
Inspired by resistance network analysis, we determine the path connectivity by series/parallel
rules and approximate higher-order rules via star-mesh transforms. Interestingly, we find that
the entanglement transmission threshold predicted by ConPT is lower than the known classical-percolation-based
results and is readily achievable on any series-parallel networks such as the Bethe lattice. ConPT
promotes our understanding of how well quantum communication can be further systematically improved
versus classical statistical predictions under the limitation of QN locality -- a "quantum advantage"
that is more general and efficient than expected. ConPT also shows a percolation-like universal
critical behavior derived by finite-size analysis on the Bethe lattice and regular two-dimensional
lattices, offering new perspectives for a theory of criticality in entanglement statistics.

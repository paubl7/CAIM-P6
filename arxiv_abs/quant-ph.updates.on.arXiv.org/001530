Renormalisation group (RG) methods provide one of the most important techniques for analysing
the physics of many-body systems, both analytically and numerically. By iterating an RG map, which
"course-grains" the description of a many-body system and generates a flow in the parameter space,
physical properties of interest can be extracted even for complex models. RG analysis also provides
an explanation of physical phenomena such as universality. Many systems exhibit simple RG flows,
but more complicated -- even chaotic -- behaviour is also known. Nonetheless, the structure of such
RG flows can still be analysed, elucidating the physics of the system, even if specific trajectories
may be highly sensitive to the initial point. In contrast, recent work has shown that important physical
properties of quantum many-body systems, such as its spectral gap and phase diagram, can be uncomputable.
In this work, we show that such undecidable systems exhibit a novel type of RG flow, revealing a qualitatively
different and more extreme form of unpredictability than chaotic RG flows. In contrast to chaotic
RG flows in which initially close points can diverge exponentially, trajectories under these novel
uncomputable RG flows can remain arbitrarily close together for an uncomputable number of iterations,
before abruptly diverging to different fixed points that are in separate phases. The structure
of such uncomputable RG flows is so complex that it cannot be computed or approximated, even in principle.
We give a mathematically rigorous construction of the block-renormalisation-group map for the
original undecidable many-body system that appeared in the literature (Cubitt, P\'erez-Garcia,
Wolf, Nature 528, 207-211 (2015)). We prove that each step of this RG map is computable, and that it
converges to the correct fixed points, yet the resulting RG flow is uncomputable.

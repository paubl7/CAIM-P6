Attosecond science is well developed for atoms and promising results have been obtained for molecules
and solids. Here, we review the first steps in developing attosecond time-resolved measurements
in liquids. These advances provide access to time-domain studies of electronic dynamics in the
natural environment of chemical reactions and biological processes. We concentrate on two techniques
that are representative of the two main branches of attosecond science: pump-probe measurements
using attosecond pulses and high-harmonic spectroscopy (HHS). In the first part, we discuss attosecond
photoelectron spectroscopy with cylindrical microjets and its application to measure time delays
between liquid and gaseous water. We present the experimental techniques, the new data-analysis
methods and the experimental results. We describe in detail the conceptual and theoretical framework
required to fully describe attosecond chronoscopy in liquids at a quantum-mechanical level. This
includes photoionization delays, scattering delays, as well as a coherent description of electron
transport and (laser-assisted) photoemission and scattering. As a consequence, we show that attosecond
chronoscopy of liquids is, in general, sensitive to both types of delays, as well as the electron
mean-free paths. Through detailed modeling, involving state-of-the-art quantum scattering
and Monte-Carlo trajectory methods, we show that the photoionization delays dominate in attosecond
chronoscopy of liquid water at photon energies of 20-30 eV. This conclusion is supported by a near-quantitative
agreement between experiment and theory. In the second part, we introduce HHS of liquids based on
flat microjets. These results represent the first observation of high-harmonic generation (HHG)
in liquids extending well beyond the visible into the extreme-ultraviolet regime.

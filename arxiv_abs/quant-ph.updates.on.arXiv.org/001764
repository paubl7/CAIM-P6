In general relativity, the description of spacetime relies on idealised rods and clocks, which
identify a reference frame. In any concrete scenario, reference frames are associated to physical
systems, which are ultimately quantum in nature. A relativistic description of the laws of physics
hence needs to take into account such quantum reference frames (QRFs), through which spacetime
can be given an operational meaning. Here, we introduce the notion of a spacetime QRF, associated
to a quantum particle in spacetime. Such formulation has the advantage of treating space and time
on equal footing, and of describing the dynamical evolution of a set of quantum systems from the perspective
of another quantum system, where the evolution parameter coincides with the proper time of the particle
taken as the QRF. Crucially, the proper times in two different QRFs are not related by a standard transformation,
but they might be in a quantum superposition. Concretely, we consider N relativistic quantum particles
in a weak gravitational field and introduce a timeless formulation in which the global state of the
N particles appears "frozen", but the dynamical evolution is recovered in terms of relational quantities.
The position and momentum Hilbert space of the particles is used to fix the QRF via a transformation
to the local frame of the particle such that the metric is locally inertial at the origin of the QRF.
The internal Hilbert space corresponds to the clock space, keeping the proper time in the local frame
of the particle. This fully relational construction shows how the remaining particles evolve from
the perspective of the QRF and includes the Page-Wootters mechanism for non interacting clocks
when the external degrees of freedom are neglected. Finally, we observe a quantum superposition
of gravitational redshifts and a quantum superposition of special-relativistic time dilations
in the QRF.

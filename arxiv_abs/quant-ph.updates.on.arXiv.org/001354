We give the first systematic study on the second order asymptotics of the operational task of coherence
distillation with and without assistance. In the unassisted setting, we introduce a variant of
randomness extraction framework where free incoherent operations are allowed before the incoherent
measurement and the randomness extractors. We then show that the maximum number of random bits extractable
from a given quantum state is precisely equal to the maximum number of coherent bits that can be distilled
from the same state. This relation enables us to derive tight second order expansions of both tasks
in the independent and identically distributed setting. Remarkably, the incoherent operation
classes that can empower coherence distillation for generic states all admit the same second order
expansions, indicating their operational equivalence for coherence distillation in both asymptotic
and large block length regime. We then generalize the above line of research to the assisted setting,
arising naturally in bipartite quantum systems where Bob distills coherence from the state at hand,
aided by the benevolent Alice possessing the other system. More precisely, we introduce a new assisted
incoherent randomness extraction task and establish an exact relation between this task and the
assisted coherence distillation. This strengthens the one-shot relation in the unassisted setting
and confirms that this cryptographic framework indeed offers a new perspective to the study of quantum
coherence distillation. Likewise, this relation yields second order characterizations to the
assisted tasks. As by-products, we show the strong converse property of the aforementioned tasks
from their second order expansions.

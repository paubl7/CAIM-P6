We develop a framework for analyzing layered quantum algorithms such as quantum alternating operator
ans\"atze. Our framework relates quantum cost gradient operators, derived from the cost and mixing
Hamiltonians, to classical cost difference functions that reflect cost function neighborhood
structure. By considering QAOA circuits from the Heisenberg picture, we derive exact general expressions
for expectation values as series expansions in the algorithm parameters, cost gradient operators,
and cost difference functions. This enables novel interpretability and insight into QAOA behavior
in various parameter regimes. For single- level QAOA1 we show the leading-order changes in the output
probabilities and cost expectation value explicitly in terms of classical cost differences, for
arbitrary cost functions. This demonstrates that, for sufficiently small positive parameters,
probability flows from lower to higher cost states on average. By selecting signs of the parameters,
we can control the direction of flow. We use these results to derive a classical random algorithm
emulating QAOA1 in the small-parameter regime, i.e., that produces bitstring samples with the
same probabilities as QAOA1 up to small error. For deeper QAOAp circuits we apply our framework to
derive analogous and additional results in several settings. In particular we show QAOA always
beats random guessing. We describe how our framework incorporates cost Hamiltonian locality for
specific problem classes, including causal cone approaches, and applies to QAOA performance analysis
with arbitrary parameters. We illuminate our results with a number of examples including applications
to QUBO problems, MaxCut, and variants of MaxSat. We illustrate the application to QAOA circuits
using mixing unitaries beyond the transverse-field mixer through two examples of constrained
optimization, Max Independent Set and Graph Coloring.

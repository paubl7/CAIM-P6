A generic qubit unitary operator affected by depolarizing noise is duplicated and inserted in a
quantum switch process realizing a superposition of causal orders. The characterization of the
resulting switched quantum channel is worked out for its action on the joint state of the probe-control
qubit pair. The switched channel is then specifically investigated for the important metrological
task of phase estimation on the noisy unitary operator, with the performance assessed by the Fisher
information, classical or quantum. A comparison is made with conventional techniques of estimation
where the noisy unitary is directly probed in a one-stage or two-stage cascade with definite order,
or several uses of them with two or more qubits. In the switched channel with indefinite order, specific
properties are reported, meaningful for estimation and not present with conventional techniques.
It is shown that the control qubit, although it never directly interacts with the unitary, can nevertheless
be measured alone for effective estimation, while discarding the probe qubit that interacts with
the unitary. Also, measurement of the control qubit maintains the possibility of efficient estimation
in difficult conditions where conventional estimation becomes less efficient, as with ill-configured
input probes, or in blind situations when the axis of the unitary is unknown. Effective estimation
by measuring the control qubit remains possible even when the input probe tends to align with the
axis of the unitary, or with a fully depolarized input probe, while in these conditions conventional
estimation gets inoperative. Measurement of the probe qubit of the switched channel is also shown
to add useful capabilities for phase estimation. The results contribute to the analysis of switched
quantum channels with indefinite order for information processing, and uncover new possibilities
for qubit metrology.

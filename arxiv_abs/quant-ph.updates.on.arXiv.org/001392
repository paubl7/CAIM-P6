We present a fully comprehensive multi-mode quantum treatment based on the truncated Wigner approximation
(TWA) to study many-body effects and quantum fluctuations on the formation of a discrete time crystal
(DTC) in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) bouncing resonantly on an atom mirror, driven at period
T. Our theoretical approach avoids the restrictions both of mean-field theory, where all bosons
are assumed to remain in a single mode, and of time-dependent Bogoliubov theory, which assumes boson
depletion from the condensate mode is small. For realistic initial conditions corresponding to
a harmonic trap condensate mode function, our TWA calculations performed for period-doubling
agree broadly with recent mean-field calculations for times out to at least 2000 T, except at interaction
strengths very close to the threshold value for DTC formation where the position probability density
differs significantly from that determined from mean-field theory. For typical attractive interaction
strengths above the threshold value for DTC formation and for the chosen trap and driving parameters,
the TWA calculations indicate a quantum depletion due to quantum many-body fluctuations of less
than about two atoms out of 600 atoms at times corresponding to 2000 T, in agreement with time-dependent
Bogoliubov theory calculations. On the other hand, for interaction strengths very close to the
threshold value for DTC formation, the TWA calculations predict a large quantum depletion - as high
as about 260 atoms out of 600. We also show that the mean energy of the DTC does not increase significantly
for times out to at least 2000 mirror oscillations, so TWA theory predicts that thermalisation is
absent. Finally, we find that the dynamical behaviour is similar for attractive or repulsive boson-boson
interactions, and that a stable DTC based on repulsive interactions can be created.

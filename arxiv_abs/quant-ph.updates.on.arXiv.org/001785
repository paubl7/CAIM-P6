Thermodynamic equilibrium properties of a macroscopic system emerge from an interaction with
a thermal bath. In the weak coupling regime, the description of thermodynamic states turns possible
to describe the system in terms of its time-independent intensive and extensive variables. However,
this is not an obvious task in both the classical and quantum cases when either dealing with finite
systems described by a few degrees of freedom when the statistical fluctuations play an important
role, i.e., not in the thermodynamic limit, or the coupling between the system and the environment
is of the same order of magnitude as their energies. On the other hand, in recent years, metrology
has been extended to the quantum regime in such a way that the fluctuation of physical quantities
plays a crucial role in the precise estimation of parameters. Using metrology tools, it is possible
to derive an uncertainty relation between the internal energy and temperature of systems for arbitrary
linear coupling scales, showing an important connection between the two research fields. Our work
is dedicated to the generalization of the thermodynamic uncertainty relations between an intensive
and an extensive quantity for all coupling regimes in the quantum scenario through the generalized
Gibbs ensemble (GGE). First, we demonstrate a fundamental limit between the intensive and extensive
quantity for a total GGE state, which makes it possible to take the trace of the degrees of freedom
of one of the systems and evaluate the uncertainty relation in the system of interest. After that,
we performed a series of examples to corroborate the results already existing in the literature,
thus showing the versatility of our method.

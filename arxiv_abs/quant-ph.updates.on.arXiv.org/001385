This work addresses quantum adiabatic decoherence of many-body systems coupled with a boson field,
in the framework of open quantum systems theory. We focus on a partition of non-interacting subsystems
to highlight the collective correlation that appears exclusively due to the coupling with a common,
correlated environment. Remarkably, this simple, exactly solvable model encompasses relevant
features of a many-body open quantum system and highlights the subtle quantum effects that arise
when the size scales up to a macroscopic level. We derive an analytical expression for the time dependence
of the density matrix elements (in the preferred basis) without assuming coarse-graining. We introduce
a system-environment interaction Hamiltonian that accounts for the many-body character of the
model system; in this way, our proposal generalizes the traditional spin-boson model. The resulting
decoherence function is a complex exponential whose exponent has a real part that introduces a decay
similar to that in the spin-boson model. On the contrary, the imaginary part of the exponent depends
on the quantum numbers and geometry of the whole partition and does not reflect the system temperature.
Motivated by solid-state NMR, and in search of realistic numerical estimations, we applied the
theoretical results to a partition of dipole-coupled spin pairs in contact with a common phonon
bath. As a significant novelty, the decoherence function phase depends on the eigenvalue distribution
throughout the sample. It plays the leading role, overshadowing the mechanism associated with
the bath thermal state. The proposal allows estimating a decoherence rate in terms of the system
physical constants: sound velocity and width of the eigenvalue distribution of the dipole interaction.
Its value and frequency dependence are remarkably similar to those measured in NMR time-reversal
experiments.

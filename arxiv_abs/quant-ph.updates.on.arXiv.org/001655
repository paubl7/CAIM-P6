For space-based laser communications, when the mean photon number per received optical pulse is
much smaller than one, there is a large gap between communications capacity achievable with a receiver
that performs individual pulse-by-pulse detection, and the quantum-optimal "joint-detection
receiver" that acts collectively on long codeword-blocks of modulated pulses; an effect often
termed "superadditive capacity". In this paper, we consider the simplest scenario where a large
superadditive capacity is known: a pure-loss channel with a coherent-state binary phase-shift
keyed (BPSK) modulation. The two BPSK states can be mapped conceptually to two non-orthogonal states
of a qubit, described by an inner product that is a function of the mean photon number per pulse. Using
this map, we derive an explicit construction of the quantum circuit of a joint-detection receiver
based on a recent idea of "belief-propagation with quantum messages" (BPQM) (arXiv:1607.04833).
We quantify its performance improvement over the Dolinar receiver that performs optimal pulse-by-pulse
detection, which represents the best "classical" approach. We analyze the scheme rigorously and
show that it achieves the quantum limit of minimum average error probability in discriminating
8 (BPSK) codewords of a length-5 binary linear code with a tree factor graph. Our result suggests
that a BPQM-receiver might attain the Holevo capacity of this BPSK-modulated pure-loss channel.
Moreover, our receiver circuit provides an alternative proposal for a quantum supremacy experiment,
targeted at a specific application that can potentially be implemented on a small, special-purpose,
photonic quantum computer capable of performing cat-basis universal qubit logic.

Quantum non-locality tests have been of interest since the 1960's paper by Bell on the original EPR
paradox.The present paper discusses whether the CGLMP (Bell) inequalities are possible tests
for showing that quantum theory is not underpinned by local hidden variable theory (LHVT). It is
found by applying Fine's theorem that the CGLMP approach involves a LHVT for the joint probabilities
associated with the measurement of one observable from each of the two sub-systems, even though
the underlying probabilities for joint measurements of all four observables may involve a non-local
HVT. The latter HVT probabilities involve simultaneous measurements of observables corresponding
to non-commuting quantum operators - allowable in classical theory. Although the CGLMP inequalities
involve probabilities for measurements of one observable per sub-system and are compatible with
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, there is no unambiguous quantum measurement process linked
to the probabilities in the CGLMP inequalities, and these quantum measurements each have different
probabilities. However, violation of a CGLMP inequality based on any one of the possible quantum
measurement sequences is sufficient to show that the Collins et al LHVT predicts different results
to quantum theory. This occurs for a state considered in their paper - though for observables whose
physical interpretation is unclear. In spite of this issue and in spite of the contextuality loophole,
it is concluded that the CGLMP inequalities are indeed suitable for ruling out both local (and non-local)
hidden variable theories. The state involved could apply to a macroscopic system, so the CGLMP Bell
inequalities are important for finding cases of macroscopic violations of Bell locality. Possible
experiments in double-well Bose condensates for atoms with two hyperfine components are discussed.

Quantum entanglement is commonly assumed to be a central resource for quantum computing and quantum
simulation. Nonetheless, the capability to detect it in many-body systems is severely limited
by the absence of sufficiently scalable and flexible certification tools. This issue is particularly
critical in situations where the structure of entanglement is \textit{a priori} unknown, and where
one cannot rely on existing entanglement witnesses. Here, we develop and validate a novel scheme,
where the knowledge of the mean value of arbitrary observables can be used to probe multipartite
entanglement in a scalable, certified and systematic manner. Specifically, we derive a complete
hierarchy of positive semidefinite conditions, independent of partial-transposition-based
criteria, necessarily obeyed if the data can be reproduced by a separable state. The violation of
any of these conditions yields a specific entanglement witness, tailored to the data of interest,
revealing the salient features of the data which are impossible to reproduce without entanglement.
We validate this approach by probing theoretical many-body states of several hundreds of qubits
relevant to existing experiments: a single-particle quench in a one-dimensional $XX$ chain; a
many-body quench in a two-dimensional $XX$ model with $1/r^3$ interactions; and thermal equilibrium
states of Heisenberg and transverse-field Ising chains. In all cases, these investigations have
lead us to discover new entanglement witnesses, some of which could be characterized analytically,
generalizing existing results in the literature. In summary, our method represents both a fundamental
contribution to the theory of multipartite entanglement and a flexible data-driven entanglement
detection technique for uncharacterized quantum many-body states, of immediate relevance to
experiments in a quantum advantage regime.

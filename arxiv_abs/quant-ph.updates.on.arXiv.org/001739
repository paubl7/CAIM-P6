We theoretically study the superconducting properties of multi-band two-dimensional transition
metal oxide superconductors by analyzing not only the role played by conventional singlet pairings,
but also by the triplet order parameters, favored by the spin-orbit couplings present in these materials.
In particular, we focus on the two-dimensional electron gas at the (001) interface between LaAlO3
and SrTiO3 band insulators where the low electron densities and the sizeable spin-orbit couplings
affect the superconducting features. Our theoretical study is based on an extended superconducting
mean-field analysis of the typical multi-band tight-binding Hamiltonian, as well as on a parallel
analysis of the effective electronic bands in the low-momentum limit, including static on-site
and inter-site intra-band attractive potentials under applied magnetic fields. The presence
of triplet pairings is able to strongly reduce the singlet order parameters which, as a result, are
no longer a monotonic function of the charge density. The interplay between the singlet and the triplet
pairings affects the dispersion of quasi-particle excitations in the Brillouin zone and also induces
anisotropy in the superconducting behavior under the action of an in-plane and of an out-of-plane
magnetic fields. Finally, non-trivial topological superconducting states become stable as a
function of the charge density, as well as of the magnitude and of the orientation of the magnetic
field. In addition to the chiral, time-reversal breaking, topological superconducting phase,
favored by the linear Rashba couplings and by the on-site attractive potentials in the presence
of an out-of-plane magnetic field, we find that a time-reversal invariant topological helical
superconducting phase is promoted by not-linear spin-orbit couplings and by the inter-site attractive
interactions in the absence of magnetic field.

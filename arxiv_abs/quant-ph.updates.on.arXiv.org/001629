We present a reconstruction of finite-dimensional quantum theory where all of the postulates are
stated in diagrammatic terms, making them intuitive. Equivalently, they are stated in category-theoretic
terms, making them mathematically appealing. Again equivalently, they are stated in process-theoretic
terms, establishing that the conceptual backbone of quantum theory concerns the manner in which
systems and processes compose. Aside from the diagrammatic form, the key novel aspect of this reconstruction
is the introduction of a new postulate, symmetric purification. Unlike the ordinary purification
postulate, symmetric purification applies equally well to classical theory as well as quantum
theory. Therefore we first reconstruct the full process theoretic description of quantum theory,
consisting of composite classical-quantum systems and their interactions, before restricting
ourselves to just the `fully quantum' systems as the final step. We propose two novel alternative
manners of doing so, `no-leaking' (roughly that information gain causes disturbance) and `purity
of cups' (roughly the existence of entangled states). Interestingly, these turn out to be equivalent
in any process theory with cups & caps. Additionally, we show how the standard purification postulate
can be seen as an immediate consequence of the symmetric purification postulate and purity of cups.
Other tangential results concern the specific frameworks of generalised probabilistic theories
(GPTs) and process theories (a.k.a. CQM). Firstly, we provide a diagrammatic presentation of GPTs,
which, henceforth, can be subsumed under process theories. Secondly, we argue that the `sharp dagger'
is indeed the right choice of a dagger structure as this sharpness is vital to the reconstruction.

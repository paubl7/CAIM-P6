Superconducting cavities with high quality factors play an essential role in circuit quantum electrodynamics
and quantum computing. In measurements of the the intrinsic loss rates of high frequency modes,
it can be challenging to design an appropriate coupling to the measurement circuit in such a way that
the resulting signal is sufficiently strong but also that this coupling does not lead to unwanted
loading circuit, obscuring the intrinsic internal loss rates. Here, we propose and demonstrate
a spectroscopic probe of high-Q resonators based on the phenomena of electromagnetically-induced
transparency (EIT) between the resonator and qubit in the weak dispersive coupling regime. Applying
a sideband drive signal to the qubit, we observe an interference dip originated from EIT in the qubit
spectroscopy, originating from the quantum interference between the qubit probe signal and sideband
transition. From the width and the depth of the dip, we are able to extract the single-photon linewidth
of the resonator from an analytical model. Working in a previously unexplored regime in which the
qubit has a larger linewidth than the resonator reduces the technical challenge of making a high-coherence
qubit and is advantageous for remaining in the weakly-invasive limit of coupling to the resonator.
Furthermore, the sideband and the dispersive coupling between the resonator and the qubit can be
tuned $in~situ$ controlling the strength of the sideband drive power. This $in-situ$ tuneability
allows the technique to be applied for efficient measurement of the resonator loss rate for any quality
factor below a fixed upper bound, on the order of $10^8$ for our device, allowing a wide range of quality
factors to probed using a single design.

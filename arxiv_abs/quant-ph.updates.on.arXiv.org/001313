Considering two non-interacting qubits in the context of open quantum systems, it is well known
that their common environment may act as an entangling agent. In a perturbative regime the influence
of the environment on the system dynamics can effectively be described by a unitary and a dissipative
contribution. For the two-spin Boson model with (sub-) Ohmic spectral density considered here,
the particular unitary contribution (Lamb shift) easily explains the buildup of entanglement
between the two qubits. Furthermore it has been argued that in the adiabatic limit, adding the so-called
counterterm to the microscopic model compensates the unitary influence of the environment and,
thus, inhibits the generation of entanglement. Investigating this assertion is one of the main
objectives of the work presented here. Using the hierarchy of pure states (HOPS) method to numerically
calculate the exact reduced dynamics, we find and explain that the degree of inhibition crucially
depends on the parameter $s$ determining the low frequency power law behavior of the spectral density
$J(\omega) \sim \omega^s e^{-\omega/\omega_c}$. Remarkably, we find that for resonant qubits,
even in the adiabatic regime (arbitrarily large $\omega_c$), the entanglement dynamics is still
influenced by an environmentally induced Hamiltonian interaction. Further, we study the model
in detail and present the exact entanglement dynamics for a wide range of coupling strengths, distinguish
between resonant and detuned qubits, as well as Ohmic and deep sub-Ohmic environments. Notably,
we find that in all cases the asymptotic entanglement does not vanish and conjecture a linear relation
between the coupling strength and the asymptotic entanglement measured by means of concurrence.
Further we discuss the suitability of various perturbative master equations for obtaining approximate
entanglement dynamics.

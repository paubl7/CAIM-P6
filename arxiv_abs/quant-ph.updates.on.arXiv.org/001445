With the ability to directly obtain the Wigner function and density matrix of photon states, quantum
tomography (QT) has had a significant impact on quantum optics, quantum computing and quantum information.
By an appropriate sequence of measurements on the evolution of each degreeof freedom (DOF), the
full quantum state of the observed photonic system can be determined. The first proposal to extend
the application of QT to reconstruction of complete quantum states of matter wavepackets had generated
enormous interest in ultrafast diffraction imaging and pump-probe spectroscopy of molecules.
This interest was elevated with the advent of ultrafast electron and X-ray diffraction techniques
using electron accelerators and X-ray free electron lasers to add temporal resolution to the observed
nuclear and electron distributions. However, the great interest in this area has been tempered
by the illustration of an impossibility theorem, known as the dimension problem. Not being able
to associate unitary evolution to every DOF of molecular motion, quantum tomography could not be
used beyond 1D and categorically excludes most vibrational and all rotational motion of molecules.
Here we present a theoretical advance to overcome the notorious dimension problem. Solving this
challenging problem is important to push imaging molecular dynamics to the quantum limit. The new
theory has solved this problem, which makes quantum tomography a truly useful methodology in ultrafast
physics and enables the making of quantum version of a molecular movie. With the new theory, quantum
tomography can be finally advanced to a sufficient level to become a general method for reconstructing
quantum states of matter, without being limited in one dimension. Our new concept is demonstrated
using a simulated dataset of ultrafast diffraction experiment of laser-aligned nitrogen molecules.

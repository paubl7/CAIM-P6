We present an experimental and theoretical investigation of the spectroscopy of dilute alkali
atoms in a solid matrix of inert gases at cryogenic temperatures, specifically Rubidium atoms in
a solid Argon or Neon matrix, and related aspects of the interaction energies between the alkali
atoms and the atoms of the solid matrix. The system considered is relevant for matrix isolation spectroscopy,
and it is at the basis of a recently proposed detector of cosmological axions, exploiting magnetic-type
transitions between Zeeman sublevels of alkali atoms in a magnetic field, tuned to the axion mass,
assumed in the meV range. Axions are one of the supposed constituents of the dark matter (DM) of the
Universe. This spectroscopy can be also relevant for experimental search of new physics beyond
the Standard Model, in particular the search of violations of time-reversal or parity-charge-conjugation
(CP) symmetry. In order to efficiently resolve the axion-induced transition in alkali doped solid
matrices, it is necessary to reduce as much as possible the spectral linewidth of the electronic
transitions involved. The theoretical investigation presented in this paper aims to evaluate
the inhomogeneous contribution to the linewidth due to the alkali-matrix interactions (Coulomb/exchange
and dispersion), and to compare the theoretical results with our experimental measurements of
spectra of dilute Rubidium atoms in Argon and Neon solid matrix. The comparison of the expected or
measured spectral linewidths will be essential for selecting the most appropriate combination
of alkali atoms and matrix inert elements to be used in the axion detection scheme. It is finally suggested
that dilute Lithium atoms diffused in a cold parahydrogen solid matrix could be an excellent system
on which the proposed detector could be based.

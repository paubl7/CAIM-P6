To investigate the fundamental nature of matter and its interactions, particles are accelerated
to very high energies and collided inside detectors, producing a multitude of other particles that
are scattered in all directions. As the charged particles traverse the detector, they leave signals
of their passage. The problem of track reconstruction is to recover the original trajectories from
these signals. This represents a very challenging data analysis problem, which will become even
more demanding as the luminosity of future accelerators keeps increasing, leading to collision
events with a more complex structure. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop more efficient
methods, capable of sieving through the vast amount of data produced by these machines, in order
to find the extremely rare events that may contain the clues for new Physics. In light of these challenges,
approaches to track reconstruction based on quantum computation have recently been put forward.
In this work, we study track reconstruction from a computational complexity perspective. Namely,
we analyse a standard algorithm for tracking, the Combinatorial Track Finder, in the asymptotic
limit of infinitely many recorded particles. First, we show that it is possible to improve the classical
algorithm in this regime. Then, we show how to use quantum search routines to reach a lower computational
complexity. And - although the found quantum speed-up is modest and of limited practical advantage
in finite scenarios - to the best of our knowledge this constitutes the first theoretical proof of
a quantum advantage for a state-of-the-art track reconstruction method, which we hope can further
inspire classical and quantum improvements to High-Energy Physics computational challenges.

The term "machine learning" especially refers to algorithms that derive mappings, i.e. intput/output
transforms, by using numerical data that provide information about considered transforms. These
transforms appear in many problems, related to classification/clustering, regression, system
identification, system inversion and input signal restoration/separation. We here first analyze
the connections between all these problems, in the classical and quantum frameworks. We then focus
on their most challenging versions, involving quantum data and/or quantum processing means, and
unsupervised, i.e. blind, learning. Moreover, we propose the quite general concept of SIngle-Preparation
Quantum Information Processing (SIPQIP). The resulting methods only require a single instance
of each state, whereas usual methods have to very accurately create many copies of each fixed state.
We apply our SIPQIP concept to various tasks, related to system identification (blind quantum process
tomography or BQPT, blind Hamiltonian parameter estimation or BHPE, blind quantum channel identification/estimation,
blind phase estimation), system inversion and state estimation (blind quantum source separation
or BQSS, blind quantum entangled state restoration or BQSR, blind quantum channel equalization)
and classification. Numerical tests show that our framework moreover yields much more accurate
estimation than the standard multiple-preparation approach. Our methods are especially useful
in a quantum computer, that we propose to more briefly call a "quamputer": BQPT and BHPE simplify
the characterization of the gates of quamputers; BQSS and BQSR allow one to design quantum gates
that may be used to compensate for the non-idealities that alter states stored in quantum registers,
and they open the way to the much more general concept of self-adaptive quantum gates (see longer
version of abstract in paper).

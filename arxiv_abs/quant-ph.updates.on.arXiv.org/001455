The performance of a QKD implementation is determined by the tightness of the underlying security
analysis. In particular, the security analyses determines the key-rate, i.e., the amount of cryptographic
key material that can be distributed per time unit. Nowadays, the security analyses of various QKD
protocols are well understood. It is known that optimal protocol parameters, such as the number
of decoy states and their intensities, can be found by solving a nonlinear optimization problem.
The complexity of this optimization problem is typically handled by making an number of heuristic
assumptions. For instance, the number of decoy states is restricted to only one or two, with one of
the decoy intensities set to a fixed value, and vacuum states are ignored as they are assumed to contribute
only marginally to the secure key-rate. These assumptions simplify the optimization problem and
reduce the size of search space significantly. However, they also cause the security analysis to
be non-tight, and thereby result in sub-optimal performance. In this work, we follow a more rigorous
approach using both linear and non-linear programs describing the optimization problem. Our approach,
focusing on the Decoy-State BB84 protocol, allows heuristic assumptions to be omitted, and therefore
results in a tighter security analysis with better protocol parameters. We show an improved performance
for the Decoy-State BB84 QKD protocol, demonstrating that the heuristic assumptions typically
made are too restrictive. Moreover, our improved optimization frameworks shows that the complexity
of the performance optimization problem can also be handled without making heuristic assumptions,
even with limited computational resources available.

We consider tests of Leggett-Garg's macrorealism and of macroscopic local realism, where for spacelike
separated measurements the assumption of macroscopic noninvasive measurability is justified
by that of macroscopic locality. We give a mapping between the Bell and Leggett-Garg experiments
for microscopic qubits based on spin $1/2$ eigenstates and gedanken experiments for macroscopic
qubits based on two macroscopically distinct coherent states (cat states). In this mapping, the
unitary rotation of the Stern-Gerlach analyzer is realized by an interaction $H=\Omega\hat{n}^{4}$
where $\hat{n}$ is the number of quanta. By adjusting the time of interaction, one alters the measurement
setting. We thus predict violations of Leggett-Garg and Bell inequalities in a macroscopic regime
where coarse-grained measurements $\hat{M}$ need only discriminate between two macroscopically
distinct coherent states. To interpret the violations, we distinguish between subtly different
definitions of macroscopic realism. Deterministic macroscopic local realism (dMR) assumes a
definite outcome for the measurement $\hat{M}$ prior to the unitary rotation created by the analyser,
and is negated by the violations. Weak macroscopic realism (wMR) assumes a definite outcome for
systems prepared in a superposition $\psi_{pointer}$ of two macroscopically-distinct eigenstates
of $\hat{M}$, after the unitary rotation. We find that wMR can be viewed as consistent with the violations.
A model is presented, in which wMR holds, and for which the macroscopic violations emerge over the
course of the unitary dynamics. Finally, we point out an EPR-type paradox, that a weak macro-realistic
description for the system prior to the measurement $\hat{M}$ is inconsistent with the completeness
of quantum mechanics.

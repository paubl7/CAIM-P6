The entanglement properties of random pure states are relevant to a variety of problems ranging
from chaotic quantum dynamics to black hole physics. The averaged bipartite entanglement entropy
of such states admits a volume law and upon increasing the subregion size follows the Page curve.
In this paper, we generalize this setup to random mixed states by coupling the system to a bath and
use the partial transpose to study their entanglement properties. We develop a diagrammatic method
to incorporate partial transpose within random matrix theory and formulate a perturbation theory
in $1/L$, the inverse of the Hilbert space dimension. We compute several quantities including the
spectral density of partial transpose (or entanglement negativity spectrum), two-point correlator
of eigenvalues, and the logarithmic negativity. As long as the bath is smaller than the system, we
find that upon sweeping the subregion size, the logarithmic negativity shows an initial increase
and a final decrease similar to the Page curve, while it admits a plateau in the intermediate regime
where the logarithmic negativity only depends on the size of the system and of the bath but not on how
the system is partitioned. This intermediate phase has no analog in random pure states, and is separated
from the two other regimes by a critical point. We further show that when the bath is larger than the
system by at least two extra qubits the logarithmic negativity is identically zero which implies
that there is no distillable entanglement. Using the diagrammatic approach, we provide a simple
derivation of the semi-circle law of the entanglement negativity spectrum in the latter two regimes.
We show that despite the appearance of a semicircle distribution, reminiscent of Gaussian unitary
ensemble (GUE), the higher order corrections to the negativity spectrum and two-point correlator
deviate from those of GUE.

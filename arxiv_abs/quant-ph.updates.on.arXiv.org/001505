Quantum supermaps are transformations that map quantum operations to quantum operations. It is
known that quantum supermaps which respect a definite, predefined causal order between their input
operations correspond to fixed-order quantum circuits. A systematic understanding of the physical
interpretation of more general types of quantum supermaps--in particular, those incompatible
with a definite causal structure--is however lacking. Here we identify two new types of circuits
that naturally generalise the fixed-order case and that likewise correspond to distinct classes
of quantum supermaps, which we fully characterise. We first introduce "quantum circuits with classical
control of causal order", in which the order of operations is still well-defined, but not necessarily
fixed in advance: it can in particular be established dynamically, in a classically-controlled
manner, as the circuit is being used. We then consider "quantum circuits with quantum control of
causal order", in which the order of operations is controlled coherently. The supermaps described
by these classes of circuits are physically realisable, and the latter encompasses all known examples
of physically realisable processes with indefinite causal order, including the celebrated "quantum
switch". Interestingly, it also contains new examples arising from the combination of dynamical
and coherent control of causal order, and we detail explicitly one such process. Nevertheless,
we show that quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order can only generate "causal" correlations,
compatible with a well-defined causal order. We furthermore extend our considerations to probabilistic
circuits that produce also classical outcomes, and we demonstrate by an example how our characterisations
allow us to identify new advantages for quantum information processing tasks that could be demonstrated
in practice.

A device capable of converting single quanta of the microwave field to the optical domain is an outstanding
endeavour in the context of quantum interconnects between distant superconducting qubits, but
likewise can have applications in other fields, such as radio astronomy or, in the classical realm,
microwave photonics. A variety of transduction approaches, based on optomechanical or electro-optical
interactions, have been proposed and realized, yet the required vanishing added noises and an efficiency
approaching unity, have not yet been attained. Here we present a new transduction scheme that could
in theory satisfy the requirements for quantum coherent bidirectional transduction. Our scheme
relies on an intermediary mechanical mode, a high overtone bulk acoustic resonance (HBAR), to coherently
couple microwave and optical photons through the piezoelectric and strain-optical effects. Its
efficiency results from the combination of integrated Si3N4 photonic circuits with ultra low loss
sustaining high intracavity photon numbers with the highly efficient microwave to mechanical
transduction offered by piezoelectrically coupled HBAR. We develop a quantum theory for this multipartite
system by first introducing a quantization method for the piezoelectric interaction between the
microwave mode and the mechanical mode from first principles (which to our knowledge has not been
presented in this form), and link the latter to the conventional Butterworth-Van Dyke model. The
HBAR is subsequently coupled to a pair of hybridized optical modes from coupled optical ring cavities
via the strain-optical effect. We analyze the conversion capabilities of the proposed device using
signal flow graphs, and demonstrate that near quantum coherent transduction is possible, with
realistic experimental parameters.

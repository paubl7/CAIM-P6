Various exotic topological phases of Floquet systems have been shown to arise from crystalline
symmetries. Yet, a general theory for Floquet topology that is applicable to all crystalline symmetry
groups is still in need. In this work, we propose such a theory for (effectively) non-interacting
Floquet crystals in symmetry class A -- in the absence of time-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral
symmetries. We first present a two-step classification scheme for the Floquet crystals. In the
first step, we classify the Floquet crystals according to the symmetry data of the quasi-energy
bands, resulting in a coarse classification that omits essential dynamical information of the
Floquet crystals. In the second step, we introduce quotient winding data to classify the dynamics
of the Floquet crystals with equivalent symmetry data. Based on the two-step classification, we
then construct dynamical symmetry indicators (DSIs) to sufficiently indicate the "inherently
dynamical" Floquet crystals -- Floquet crystals with obstruction to static limits. Specifically,
a nonzero DSI infers that continuously deforming the corresponding Floquet crystal to any static
limit always breaks symmetries or closes certain relevant gaps. The DSI and quotient winding data,
as well as the symmetry data, are all computationally efficient since they only involve a small number
of Bloch momenta. We demonstrate the efficiency by computing all elementary DSI sets for all spinless
and spinful plane groups, using the mathematical theory for affine monoids. We further apply one
of the obtained DSI sets to a previously-proposed 2+1D anomalous Floquet higher-order topological
insulator phase, and efficiently determine its obstruction to static limits. Owing to the generality
and high efficiency, our theory will be powerful in the future prediction of new topological phases
of Floquet crystals.

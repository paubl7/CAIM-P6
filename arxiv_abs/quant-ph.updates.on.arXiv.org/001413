Closure phase is the phase of a closed-loop product of spatial coherences formed by a $\ge 3$-element
interferometer array. Its invariance to element-based phase corruption acquired during propagation
and measurement processes, and phase calibration and errors therein, makes it invaluable for interferometric
applications that otherwise require high-accuracy phase calibration. However, its understanding
has remained mainly mathematical and limited to the aperture plane (Fourier dual of image plane).
Here, we lay the foundations for a geometrical insight. We develop and demonstrate a shape-orientation-size
(SOS) conservation theorem for images made from a closed triad of elements, in which the relative
location of the Null Phase Curves (NPCs) of the three interferometer responses ("fringes") are
preserved, even in the presence of large element-based phase errors, besides overall translation
of the fringe pattern. We present two geometric methods to measure the closure phase directly in
the image plane (without an aperture-plane view) with a 3-element array and its interference pattern:
(i) the closure phase is directly measurable from the positional offset of the NPC of one fringe from
the intersection of the other two fringe NPCs, and (ii) the squared closure phase is proportional
to the product of the areas enclosed by the triad of array elements and the three fringe NPCs in the
aperture and image planes, respectively. We validate this geometric understanding using data
observed with the Jansky Very large Array radio telescope. This geometric insight can be potentially
valuable to other interferometric applications including optical interferometry. Close parallels
exist between interferometric closure phases, structure invariants in crystallography, and
phases of Bargmann invariants in quantum mechanics. We generalize these geometric relationships
to an N-element interferometer.

We numerically study both the avalanche instability and many-body resonances in strongly-disordered
spin chains exhibiting many-body localization (MBL). We distinguish between a finite-size/time
MBL regime, and the asymptotic MBL phase, and identify some "landmarks" within the MBL regime. Our
first landmark is an estimate of where the MBL phase becomes unstable to avalanches, obtained by
measuring the slowest relaxation rate of a finite chain coupled to an infinite bath at one end. Our
estimates indicate that the actual MBL-to-thermal phase transition, in infinite-length systems,
occurs much deeper in the MBL regime than has been suggested by most previous studies. Our other landmarks
involve system-wide resonances. We find that the effective matrix elements producing eigenstates
with system-wide resonances are enormously broadly distributed. This means that the onset of such
resonances in typical samples occurs quite deep in the MBL regime, and the first such resonances
typically involve rare pairs of eigenstates that are farther apart in energy than the minimum gap.
Thus we find that the resonance properties define two landmarks that divide the MBL regime in to three
subregimes: (i) at strongest disorder, typical samples do not have any eigenstates that are involved
in system-wide many-body resonances; (ii) there is a substantial intermediate regime where typical
samples do have such resonances, but the pair of eigenstates with the minimum spectral gap does not;
and (iii) in the weaker randomness regime, the minimum gap is involved in a many-body resonance and
thus subject to level repulsion. Nevertheless, even in this third subregime, all but a vanishing
fraction of eigenstates remain non-resonant and the system thus still appears MBL in many respects.
Based on our estimates of the location of the avalanche instability, it might be that the MBL phase
is only part of subregime (i).

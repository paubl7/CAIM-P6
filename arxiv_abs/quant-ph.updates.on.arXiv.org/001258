During the last three decades, P. B\'{o}na has developed a non-linear generalization of quantum
mechanics, based on symplectic structures for normal states and offering a general setting which
is convenient to study the emergence of macroscopic classical dynamics from microscopic quantum
processes. We propose here a new mathematical approach to Bona's one, with much brother domain of
applicability. It highlights the central role of self-consistency. This leads to a mathematical
framework in which the classical and quantum worlds are naturally entangled. We build a Poisson
bracket for the polynomial functions on the hermitian weak$^{\ast }$ continuous functionals on
any $C^{\ast }$-algebra. This is reminiscent of a well-known construction for finite-dimensional
Lie algebras. We then restrict this Poisson bracket to states of this $C^{\ast }$-algebra, by taking
quotients with respect to Poisson ideals. This leads to densely defined symmetric derivations
on the commutative $C^{\ast }$-algebras of real-valued functions on the set of states. Up to a closure,
these are proven to generate $C_{0}$-groups of contractions. As a matter of fact, in general commutative
$C^{\ast }$-algebras, even the closableness of unbounded symmetric derivations is a non-trivial
issue. Some new mathematical concepts are introduced, which are possibly interesting by themselves:
the convex weak $^{\ast }$ G\^{a}teaux derivative, state-dependent $C^{\ast }$-dynamical systems
and the weak$^{\ast }$-Hausdorff hypertopology, a new hypertopology used to prove, among other
things, that convex weak$^{\ast }$-compact sets generically have weak$^{\ast }$-dense extreme
boundary in infinite dimension. Our recent results on macroscopic dynamical properties of lattice-fermion
and quantum-spin systems with long-range, or mean-field, interactions corroborate the relevance
of the general approach we present here.

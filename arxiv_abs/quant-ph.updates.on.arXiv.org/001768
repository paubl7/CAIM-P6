Typical experiments in spintronics and magnonics operate with very large number of localized spins
within ferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials, so that their nonequilibrium
dynamics is standardly described by the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation treating localized spins
as classical vectors of fixed length. However, spin is a genuine quantum degree of freedom, and even
though quantum effects become progressively less important for spin value $S>1$, they exist for
all $S < \infty$. While this has motivated exploration of the limits of applicability of the LL equation,
by using examples of FM insulators and comparing LL trajectories to quantum expectation values
of localized spin operators, analogous comparison of fully quantum many-body vs. quantum-for-electrons--classical-for-localized-spins
dynamics in systems where nonequilibrium conduction electrons are present is lacking. Here we
employ quantum Heisenberg FM or AFM chains, whose localized spins interact with conduction electrons
via $sd$ exchange interaction, to perform such comparison by starting from unentangled ground
state of localized spins at the initial time. This reveals that quantum-classical dynamics can
faithfully reproduce fully quantum dynamics in the FM case, but only when spin $S$, Heisenberg exchange
between localized spins and $sd$ exchange are sufficiently small. Increasing any of these three
parameters can lead to substantial deviations, which are explained by the growth of entanglement
between localized spins and/or between them and electrons. In the AFM case, substantial deviations
appear even at early times, despite starting from unentangled N\'{e}el in equilibrium, which,
therefore, poses a challenge on how to justify rigorously wide usage of the LL equation in modeling
of antiferromagnetic spintronics experiments.

We propose a quantum k-means algorithm based on quantum cloud computing that effectively solves
the problem that the client can not afford to execute the same quantum subroutine repeatedly in the
face of large training samples. In the quantum k-means algorithm, the core subroutine is the Quantum
minimization algorithm (GroverOptim), the client needs to repeat several Grover searches to find
the minimum value in each iteration to find a new clustering center, so we use quantum homomorphic
encryption scheme (QHE) to encrypt the data and upload it to the cloud for computing. After calculation,
the server returns the calculation result to the client. The client uses the key to decrypt to get
the plaintext result. It reduces the computing pressure for the client to repeat the same operation.
In addition, when executing in the cloud, the key update of T-gate in the server is inevitable and
complex. Therefore, this paper also proposes a T-gate update scheme based on trusted server in quantum
ciphertext environment. In this scheme, the server is divided into trusted server and semi-trusted
server. The semi-trusted server completes the calculation operation, and when the T-gate is executed
in the circuit, the trusted server assists the semi-trusted server to calculate the T-gate, and
then randomly generates a key and uploads it to the semi-trusted server. The trusted server assists
the client to complete the key update operation, which once again reduces the pressure on the client
and improves the efficiency of the quantum homomorphic encryption scheme. And on the basis of this
scheme, the experiment is given by using IBM Qiskit to give the subroutine of quantum k-means. The
experimental results show that the scheme can realize the corresponding computing function on
the premise of ensuring security.

Present protocols of criticality enhanced sensing with open quantum sensors assume direct measurement
of the sensor and omit the radiation quanta emitted to the environment, thereby omitting potentially
valuable information. Here we propose a protocol for criticality enhanced sensing via continuous
observation of the emitted radiation quanta. Under general assumptions, we establish a scaling
theory for the global quantum Fisher information of the joint system and environment state at a dissipative
critical point. We demonstrate that it obeys universal scaling laws featuring transient and long-time
behavior governed by the underlying critical exponents. Importantly, such scaling laws exceed
the standard quantum limit and can in principle satuarate the Heisenberg limit. To harness such
advantageous scaling, we propose a practical sensing scheme based on continuous detection of the
emitted quanta. In such a scheme a single interrogation corresponds to a (stochastic) quantum trajectory
of the open system evolving under the non-unitary dynamics dependent on the parameter to be sensed
and the back-action of the continuous measurement. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the associated
precision scaling significantly exceeds that based on direct measurement of the critical steady
state, thereby establishing the metrological value of detection of the emitted quanta at dissipative
criticality. We illustrate our protocol via counting the photons emitted by the open Rabi model,
a paradigmatic model for the study of dissipative phase transition with finite components. Our
protocol is applicable to diverse open quantum sensors permitting continuous readout, and may
find applications at the frontier of quantum sensing such as human-machine interface, magnetic
diagnosis of heart disease and zero-field nuclear magnetic resonance.

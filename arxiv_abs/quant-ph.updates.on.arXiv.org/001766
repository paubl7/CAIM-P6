Surfaces are at the frontier of every known solid. They provide versatile supports for functional
nanostructures and mediate essential physicochemical processes. Being intimately related with
2D materials, interfaces and atomically thin films often feature distinct electronic states with
respect to the bulk, which are key for many relevant properties, such as catalytic activity, interfacial
charge-transfer, or crystal growth mechanisms. Of particular interest is reducing the surface
electrons' dimensionality and spread with atomic precision, to induce novel quantum properties
via lateral scattering and confinement. Both atomic manipulation and supramolecular principles
provide access to custom-designed molecular superlattices, which tailor the surface electronic
landscape and influence fundamental chemical and physical properties at the nanoscale. Herein,
we review the confinement of surface state electrons focusing on their interaction with molecule-based
scaffolds created by molecular manipulation and self-assembly protocols under ultrahigh vacuum
conditions. Starting from the quasi-free 2D electron gas present at the (111)-terminated surface
planes of noble metals, we illustrate the enhanced molecule-based structural complexity and versatility
compared to simple atoms. We survey low-dimensional confining structures in the form of artificial
lattices, molecular nanogratings or quantum dot arrays, which are constructed upon appropriate
choice of their building constituents. Whenever the realized (metal-)organic networks exhibit
long-range order, modified surface band structures with characteristic features emerge, revealing
intriguing physical properties, such as discretization, quantum coupling or energy and effective
mass renormalization. Such collective electronic states can be additionally modified by positioning
guest species at the voids of open nanoarchitectures [...].

Coherent quantum microwave transmission is key to realizing modular superconducting quantum
computers and distributed quantum networks. However, a large number of incoherent photons are
thermally generated in the microwave frequency spectrum. Hence, coherent transmission of microwave
fields has long been believed to be infeasible without refrigeration. In this work, we propose a
novel method for coherent microwave transmission using a typical microwave waveguide at room temperature.
The proposed scheme considers two cryogenic nodes (i.e., a transmitter and a receiver) connected
by a room-temperature microwave waveguide. At the receiver side, we implement a cryogenic loop
antenna coupled to an LC harmonic oscillator inside the output port of the waveguide, while the LC
harmonic oscillator is located outside the waveguide. The loop antenna converts the quantum microwave
fields (which contain both signal and thermal noise photons) to a quantum voltage across the coupled
LC harmonic oscillator. We show that by properly designing the loop antenna, the number of detected
noise photons can be significantly less than one. Simultaneously, the detected signal photons
can be maintained at a sufficient number greater than one by transmitting a proper number of photons
at the input port of the waveguide. For example, we show that for a 10 GHz microwave signal, when using
a room-temperature transmission waveguide of 5m length, 35 coherent photons are detected across
the LC circuit by transmitting 32x10^4 signal photons at the input port of the waveguide. Interestingly,
the number of detected noise photons is maintained as small as 6.3x10^-3. The microwave transmission
scheme proposed in this work paves the way towards realizing practical modular quantum computers
with a simple architecture.

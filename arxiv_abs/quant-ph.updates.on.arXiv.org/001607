The van der Waals compound, MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, is the first intrinsic magnetic topological insulator,
providing a materials platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena such as the axion insulator
state and the quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, intrinsic structural imperfections lead
to bulk conductivity, and the roles of magnetic defects are still unknown. With higher concentrations
of same types of magnetic defects, the isostructural compound MnSb$_2$Te$_4$ is a better model
system for a systematic investigation of the connections among magnetic, topology and lattice
defects. In this work, the impact of antisite defects on the magnetism and electronic structure
is studied in MnSb$_2$Te$_4$. Mn-Sb site mixing leads to complex magnetic structures and tunes
the interlayer magnetic coupling between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic. The detailed
nonstoichiometry and site-mixing of MnSb$_2$Te$_4$ crystals depend on the growth parameters,
which can lead to $\approx$40\% of Mn sites occupied by Sb and $\approx$15\% of Sb sites by Mn in as-grown
crystals. Single crystal neutron diffraction and electron microscopy studies show nearly random
distribution of the antisite defects. Band structure calculations suggest that the Mn-Sb site-mixing
favors a FM interlayer coupling, consistent with experimental observation, but is detrimental
to the band inversion required for a nontrivial topology. Our results suggest a long range magnetic
order of Mn ions sitting on Bi sites in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. The effects of site mixing should be considered
in all layered heterostructures that consist of alternating magnetic and topological layers,
including the entire family of MnTe(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_n$, its Sb analogs and their solid solution.

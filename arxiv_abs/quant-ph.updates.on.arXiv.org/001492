Quantum system characterization techniques represent the front line in the identification and
mitigation of noise in quantum computing, but can be expensive in terms of quantum resources and
time to repeatedly employ. Another challenging aspect is that parameters governing the performance
of various operations tend to drift over time, and monitoring these is hence a difficult task. One
of the most promising characterization techniques, gate set tomography (GST), provides a self-consistent
estimate of the completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) maps for a complete set of gates,
as well as preparation and measurement operators. We develop a method for performance optimization
seeded by tomography (POST), which couples the power of GST with a classical optimization routine
to achieve a consistent gate improvement in just a short number of steps within a given calibration
cycle. By construction, the POST procedure finds the best available gate operation given the hardware,
and is therefore robust to the effects of drift. Further, in comparison to other quantum error mitigation
techniques, it builds upon a one-time application of GST. To demonstrate the performance of this
method on a real quantum computer, we map out the operations of six qubit pairs on the superconducting
\emph{ibmq\_poughkeepsie} quantum device. Under the restriction of logical-only control, we
monitor the performance of the POST approach on a chosen CNOT gate over a period of six weeks. In this
time, we achieve a consistent improvement in gate fidelity, averaging a fidelity increase of 21.1\%
as measured by randomized benchmarking. The POST approach should find wide applicability as it
is hardware agnostic, and can be applied at the upper logical level or at a deeper pulse control level.

Recent theoretical work has shown that the competition between coherent unitary dynamics and stochastic
measurements, performed by the environment, along wavefunction trajectories can give rise to
transitions in the entanglement scaling. In this work, complementary to these previous studies,
we analyze a situation where the role of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics is reversed. We consider
an engineered dissipation, which stabilizes an entangled phase of a quantum spin$-1/2$ chain,
while competing single-particle or interacting Hamiltonian dynamics induce a disentangled phase.
Focusing on the single-particle unitary dynamics, we find that the system undergoes an entanglement
transition from a logarithmic growth to an area law when the competition ratio between the unitary
evolution and the non-unitary dynamics increases. We evidence that the transition manifests itself
in state-dependent observables at a finite competition ratio for Hamiltonian and measurement
dynamics. On the other hand, it is absent in trajectory-averaged steady-state dynamics, governed
by a Lindblad master equation: although purely dissipative dynamics stabilizes an entangled state,
for any non-vanishing Hamiltonian contribution the system ends up irremediably in a disordered
phase. In addition, a single trajectory analysis reveals that the distribution of the entanglement
entropy constitutes an efficient indicator of the transition. Complementarily, we explore the
competition of the dissipation with coherent dynamics generated by an interacting Hamiltonian,
and demonstrate that the entanglement transition also occurs in this second model. Our results
suggest that this type of transition takes place for a broader class of Hamiltonians, underlining
its robustness in monitored open quantum many-body systems.

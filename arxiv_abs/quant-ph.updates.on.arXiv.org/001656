We give a quantum logspace algorithm for powering contraction matrices, that is, matrices with
spectral norm at most~1. The algorithm gets as an input an arbitrary $n\times n$ contraction matrix
$A$, and a parameter $T \leq \mathrm{poly}(n)$ and outputs the entries of $A^T$, up to (arbitrary)
polynomially small additive error. The algorithm applies only unitary operators, without intermediate
measurements. We show various implications and applications of this result: First, we use this
algorithm to show that the class of quantum logspace algorithms with only quantum memory and with
intermediate measurements is equivalent to the class of quantum logspace algorithms with only
quantum memory without intermediate measurements. This shows that the deferred-measurement
principle, a fundamental principle of quantum computing, applies also for quantum logspace algorithms
(without classical memory). More generally, we give a quantum algorithm with space $O(S + \log T)$
that takes as an input the description of a quantum algorithm with quantum space $S$ and time $T$,
with intermediate measurements (without classical memory), and simulates it unitarily with polynomially
small error, without intermediate measurements. Since unitary transformations are reversible
(while measurements are irreversible) an interesting aspect of this result is that it shows that
any quantum logspace algorithm (without classical memory) can be simulated by a reversible quantum
logspace algorithm. This proves a quantum analogue of the result of Lange, McKenzie and Tapp that
deterministic logspace is equal to reversible logspace [LMT00]. Finally, we use our results to
show non-trivial classical simulations of quantum logspace learning algorithms.

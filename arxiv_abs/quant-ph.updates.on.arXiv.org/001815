Recalling that the rotating wave approximation (RWA) is only valid in the weak coupling regimes,
the purpose of this paper is to study the Hamiltonian dynamics describing the full quantum mechanical
approach of the interaction between various configurations of three-level atoms Lambda, V and
ladder distinctly with a two-mode radiation field, while the RWA is not considered; the counter-rotating
terms (CRTs) are taken into account. Generally, the presence of CRTs in the Hamiltonian prevents
one to achieve an analytical solution. Moreover, as we will show in the present work, using the perturbation
theory, analytical solvable Hamiltonians can be successfully obtained. According to our calculations,
the contribution of CRTs within the ordinary Hamiltonian is equivalent to the replacement of the
constant detuning with a specific intensity dependent detuning in the first order, and the constant
atom field coupling with a particular intensity dependent (f deformed) coupling in the second order
of the associated perturbation parameter. Moreover, noticing that according to the initial expression
of the Hamiltonian, each mode of the field interacts only with a specific pair of the allowed transitions
of each type of the three-level atom, it is surprisingly observed that via applying the mentioned
approach, the obtained intensity dependent coupling functions depend on both modes of the field,
f(na,nb). In this way, it is seen that the CRTs are removed with the price of arriving at some intermixed
intensity dependent atom field coupling functions of the two modes of the field. In this way, the
obtained final Hamiltonians are analytically solvable. At last, by determining the time evolution
of the atom field wave function, we study the effects of CRTs on a few nonclassical properties of the
state of the system, including the atomic population inversion and photon statistics.

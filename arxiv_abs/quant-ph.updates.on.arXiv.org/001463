Farhi et al. recently proposed a class of quantum algorithms, the Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA), for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. A level-p
QAOA circuit consists of p steps; in each step a classical Hamiltonian, derived from the cost function,
is applied followed by a mixing Hamiltonian. The 2p times for which these two Hamiltonians are applied
are the parameters of the algorithm, which are to be optimized classically for the best performance.
As p increases, parameter optimization becomes inefficient due to the curse of dimensionality.
The success of the QAOA approach will depend, in part, on finding effective parameter-setting strategies.
Here, we analytically and numerically study parameter setting for QAOA applied to MaxCut. For level-1
QAOA, we derive an analytical expression for a general graph. In principle, expressions for higher
p could be derived, but the number of terms quickly becomes prohibitive. For a special case of MaxCut,
the ring of disagrees, or the 1D antiferromagnetic ring, we provide an analysis for arbitrarily
high level. Using a fermionic representation, the evolution of the system under QAOA translates
into quantum control of an ensemble of independent spins. This treatment enables us to obtain analytical
expressions for the performance of QAOA for any p. It also greatly simplifies numerical search for
the optimal values of the parameters. By exploring symmetries, we identify a lower-dimensional
sub-manifold of interest; the search effort can be accordingly reduced. This analysis also explains
an observed symmetry in the optimal parameter values. Further, we numerically investigate the
parameter landscape and show that it is a simple one in the sense of having no local optima.

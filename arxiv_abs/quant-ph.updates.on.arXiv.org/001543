Clustering is grouping of data by the proximity of some properties. We report on the possibility
of increasing the efficiency of clustering of points in a plane using artificial quantum neural
networks after the replacement of the two-level neurons called qubits represented by the spins
S = 1/2 by the three-level neurons called qutrits represented by the spins S = 1. The problem has been
solved by the slow adiabatic change of the Hamiltonian in time. The methods for controlling a qutrit
system using projection operators have been developed and the numerical simulation has been performed.
The Hamiltonians for two well-known cluster-ing methods, one-hot encoding and k-means ++, have
been built. The first method has been used to partition a set of six points into three or two clusters
and the second method, to partition a set of nine points into three clusters and seven points into
four clusters. The simulation has shown that the clustering problem can be ef-fectively solved
on qutrits represented by the spins S = 1. The advantages of clustering on qutrits over that on qubits
have been demonstrated. In particular, the number of qutrits required to represent data points
is smaller than the number of qubits by a factor of log2 N / log3 N . Since, for qutrits, it is easier to
partition the data points into three clusters rather than two ones, the approximate hierarchical
procedure of data partition-ing into a larger number of clusters is accelerated. At the exact data
partition into more than three clusters, it has been proposed to number the clusters by the numbers
of states of the corresponding multi-spin subsys-tems, instead of using the numbers of individual
spins. This reduces even more the number of qutrits (N log3 K instead of NK ) required to implement
the algorithm.

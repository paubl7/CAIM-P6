A class of high-order canonical symplectic structure-preserving geometric algorithms are developed
for high-quality simulations of the quantized Dirac-Maxwell theory based strong-field quantum
electrodynamics (SFQED) and relativistic quantum plasmas (RQP) phenomena. With minimal coupling,
the Lagrangian density of an interacting bispinor-gauge fields theory is constructed in a conjugate
real fields form. The canonical symplectic form and canonical equations of this field theory are
obtained by the general Hamilton's principle on cotangent bundle. Based on discrete exterior calculus,
the gauge field components are discreted to form a cochain complex, and the bispinor components
are naturally discreted on a staggered dual lattice as different differential forms. With pull-back
and push-forward gauge covariant derivatives, the discrete action is gauge invariant. A well-defined
discrete canonical Poisson bracket generates a semi-discrete lattice canonical field theory
(LCFT), which admits canonical symplectic form, unitary property, gauge symmetry and Poincar\'e
invariance. The Hamiltonian splitting method, Cayley transformation and symmetric composition
technique are introduced to construct a class of high-order numerical schemes for the semi-discrete
LCFT. These schemes are fermion doubling free and locally unconditional stable, which also preserve
the geometric structures. Equipped with statistically quantization-equivalent ensemble models
of the Dirac vacuum and non-trivial plasma backgrounds, the schemes are expected to have excellent
performance in secular simulations of relativistic quantum effects. The algorithms are verified
in detail by numerical energy spectra. Real-time LCFT simulations are successfully implemented
for the nonlinear Schwinger mechanism induced $e-e^+$ pairs creation and vacuum Kerr effect, which
open a new door toward high-quality simulations in SFQED and RQP.

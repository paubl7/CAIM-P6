In the ballistic regime we study both semiclassically and quantum mechanically the electron's
dynamics in two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field
applied perpendicular to the plane. The magnetic field is constant inside four separate circular
regions which are located at the four corners of a square of side length larger than the diameter of
the circles, while outside the circles the magnetic field is zero. We carry out the stability analysis
of the periodic orbits and for given initial conditions numerically calculate the two-dimensional
invariant torus embedded in the four-dimensional phase space. Applying the Bohr--Sommerfeld
and the Einstein--Brillouin--Keller semiclassical quantization methods we obtain the energy
levels for different magnetic field strengths. We also perform exact quantum calculations solving
numerically the discretized version of the Schr\"odinger equation. In our calculations, we consider
only those bound states that are localized to the neighborhood of the four magnetic disks. We show
that the semiclassical results are in good agreement with those found from our quantum calculations.
Moreover, the current distribution and the phase of the different wave functions enable us to deduce
the two quantum numbers $n_1$ and $n_2$ characterizing the energy levels in the semiclassical methods.
Finally, we present two examples in which the quantum state shows a similar structure to the previous
states, but these are special in the following sense. One of them is a scar state localized to the neighborhood
of the periodic orbit while this orbit is already unstable. In the case of the other state, the current
density is circulating in two rings in opposite direction. Thus, it is not consistent with the classical
motion in the neighborhood of the periodic orbit.

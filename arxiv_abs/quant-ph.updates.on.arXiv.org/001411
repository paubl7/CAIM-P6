In a recent breakthrough, Mahadev constructed a classical verification of quantum computation
(CVQC) protocol for a classical client to delegate decision problems in BQP to an untrusted quantum
prover under computational assumptions. In this work, we explore further the feasibility of CVQC
with the more general sampling problems in BQP and with the desirable blindness property. We contribute
affirmative solutions to both as follows. (1) Motivated by the sampling nature of many quantum applications
(e.g., quantum algorithms for machine learning and quantum supremacy tasks), we initiate the study
of CVQC for quantum sampling problems (denoted by SampBQP). More precisely, in a CVQC protocol for
a SampBQP problem, the prover and the verifier are given an input $x\in \{0,1\}^n$ and a quantum circuit
$C$, and the goal of the classical client is to learn a sample from the output $z \leftarrow C(x)$ up
to a small error, from its interaction with an untrusted prover. We demonstrate its feasibility
by constructing a four-message CVQC protocol for SampBQP based on the quantum Learning With Error
assumption. (2) The blindness of CVQC protocols refers to a property of the protocol where the prover
learns nothing, and hence is blind, about the client's input. It is a highly desirable property that
has been intensively studied for the delegation of quantum computation. We provide a simple yet
powerful generic compiler that transforms any CVQC protocol to a blind one while preserving its
completeness and soundness errors as well as the number of rounds. Applying our compiler to (a parallel
repetition of) Mahadev's CVQC protocol for BQP and our CVQC protocol for SampBQP yields the first
constant-round blind CVQC protocol for BQP and SampBQP respectively, with negligible completeness
and soundness errors.

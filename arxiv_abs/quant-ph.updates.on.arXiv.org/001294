The utility of NISQ devices can be increased by algorithms that fit larger problem sizes on smaller
devices. One strategy is to exploit a tradeoff between circuit width and circuit depth. Unfortunately,
this tradeoff still limits the size of tractable problems since the increased depth is often not
realizable before noise dominates. Here, we develop qubit-efficient quantum algorithms for entanglement
spectroscopy which avoid this tradeoff. In particular, we develop algorithms for computing the
trace of the n-th power of the density operator of a quantum system, $Tr(\rho^n)$, (related to the
R\'enyi entropy of order n) that use fewer qubits than any previous efficient algorithm while achieving
similar performance in the presence of noise, thus enabling spectroscopy of larger quantum systems
on NISQ devices than previously possible. Our algorithms, which require a number of qubits independent
of n, are variants of previous algorithms with width proportional to n, an asymptotic difference.
The crucial ingredient in these new algorithms is the ability to measure and reinitialize subsets
of qubits in the course of the computation. By carefully arranging these qubits resets, we are able
to reuse qubits and increase the circuit depth without suffering the usual noisy consequences.
We also introduce the notion of effective circuit depth as a generalization of standard circuit
depth suitable for circuits with qubit resets. This tool helps explain the noise-resilience of
our qubit-efficient algorithms and should aid in designing future algorithms. We perform numerical
simulations to compare our algorithms to the original variants and show they perform similarly
when subjected to noise. Additionally, we experimentally implement one of our qubit-efficient
algorithms on the Honeywell System Model H0, estimating $Tr(\rho^n)$ for larger n than would have
been possible with previous algorithms.

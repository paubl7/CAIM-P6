Adaptive filtering is a powerful class of control theoretic concepts useful in extracting information
from noisy data sets or performing forward prediction in time for a dynamic system. The broad utilization
of the associated algorithms makes them attractive targets for similar problems in the quantum
domain. To date, however, the construction of adaptive filters for quantum systems has typically
been carried out in terms of stochastic differential equations for weak, continuous quantum measurements,
as used in linear quantum systems such as optical cavities. Discretized measurement models are
not as easily treated in this framework, but are frequently employed in quantum information systems
leveraging projective measurements. This paper presents a detailed analysis of several technical
innovations that enable classical filtering of discrete projective measurements, useful for
adaptively learning system-dynamics, noise properties, or hardware performance variations
in classically correlated measurement data from quantum devices. In previous work we studied a
specific case of this framework, in which noise and calibration errors on qubit arrays could be efficiently
characterized in space; here, we present a generalized analysis of filtering in quantum systems
and demonstrate that the traditional convergence properties of nonlinear classical filtering
hold using single-shot projective measurements. These results are important early demonstrations
indicating that a range of concepts and techniques from classical nonlinear filtering theory may
be applied to the characterization of quantum systems involving discretized projective measurements,
paving the way for broader adoption of control theoretic techniques in quantum technology.

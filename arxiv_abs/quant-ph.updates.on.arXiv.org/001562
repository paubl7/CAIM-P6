I address the view that the classical electromagnetic potentials are shown by the Aharonov-Bohm
effect to be physically real (which I dub: 'the potentials view'). I give a historico-philosophical
presentation of this view and assess its prospects, more precisely than has so far been done in the
literature. Taking the potential as physically real runs prima facie into 'gauge-underdetermination':
different gauge choices represent different physical states of affairs and hence different theories.
I then illustrate this theme by what I take to be the basic insight of the AB effect for the potentials
view, namely that the gauge equivalence class that directly corresponds to the electric and magnetic
fields (which I call the Wide Equivalence Class) is too wide, i.e., the Narrow Equivalence Class
encodes additional physical degrees of freedom: these only play a distinct role in a multiply-connected
space. There is a trade-off between explanatory power and gauge symmetries. Although this narrower
equivalence class gives a explanation in terms of `local interactions', locality is not satisfied
in the sense of signal locality. It is therefore intellectually mandatory to seek desiderata that
will distinguish even within these narrower equivalence classes, i.e. will prefer some elements
of such an equivalence class over others. I consider various formulations of locality, such as Bell
locality, local interaction Hamiltonians, and signal locality. I show that Bell locality can only
be evaluated if one fixes the gauge freedom completely. Yet, an explanation in terms of signal locality
can be accommodated by the Lorenz gauge: the potentials propagate in waves at finite speed. I therefore
suggest the Lorenz gauge potentials theory -- an even narrower gauge equivalence relation -- as
the ontology of electrodynamics.

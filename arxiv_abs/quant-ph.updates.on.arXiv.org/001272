Noble metal nanostructures are ubiquitous elements in nano-optics, supporting plasmon modes
that can focus light down to length scales commensurate with nonlocal effects associated with quantum
confinement and spatial dispersion in the underlying electron gas. Nonlocal effects are naturally
more prominent for crystalline noble metals, which potentially offer lower intrinsic loss than
their amorphous counterparts, and with particular crystal facets giving rise to distinct electronic
surface states. Here, we employ a quantum-mechanical model to describe nonclassical effects impacting
the optical response of crystalline noble-metal films and demonstrate that these can be well-captured
using a set of surface-response functions known as Feibelman $d$-parameters. In particular, we
characterize the $d$-parameters associated with the (111) and (100) crystal facets of gold, silver,
and copper, emphasizing the importance of surface effects arising due to electron wave function
spill-out and the surface-projected band gap emerging from atomic-layer corrugation. We then
show that the extracted $d$-parameters can be straightforwardly applied to describe the optical
response of various nanoscale metal morphologies of interest, including metallic ultra-thin
films, graphene-metal heterostructures hosting extremely confined acoustic graphene plasmons,
and crystallographic faceted metallic nanoparticles supporting localized surface plasmons.
The tabulated $d$-parameters reported here can circumvent computationally expensive first-principles
atomistic simulations to describe microscopic nonlocal effects in the optical response of mesoscopic
crystalline metal surfaces, which are becoming widely available with increasing control over
morphology down to atomic length scales for state-of-the-art experiments in nano-optics.

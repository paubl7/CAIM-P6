Measurement noise is one of the main sources of errors in currently available quantum devices based
on superconducting qubits. At the same time, the complexity of its characterization and mitigation
often exhibits exponential scaling with the system size. In this work, we introduce a correlated
measurement noise model that can be efficiently described and characterized, and which admits
effective noise-mitigation on the level of marginal probability distributions. Noise mitigation
can be performed up to some error for which we derive upper bounds. Characterization of the model
is done efficiently using a generalization of the recently introduced Quantum Overlapping Tomography.
We perform experiments on 15 (23) qubits using IBM's (Rigetti's) devices to test both the noise model
and the error-mitigation scheme, and obtain an average reduction of errors by a factor $>22$ ($>5.5$)
compared to no mitigation. Interestingly, we find that correlations in the measurement noise do
not correspond to the physical layout of the device. Furthermore, we study numerically the effects
of readout noise on the performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).
We observe in simulations that for numerous objective Hamiltonians, including random MAX-2-SAT
instances and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, the noise-mitigation improves the quality
of the optimization. Finally, we provide arguments why in the course of QAOA optimization the estimates
of the local energy (or cost) terms often behave like uncorrelated variables, which greatly reduces
sampling complexity of the energy estimation compared to the pessimistic error analysis. We also
show that similar effects are expected for Haar-random quantum states and states generated by shallow-depth
random circuits.

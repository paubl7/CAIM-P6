Recent years have seen significant developments in the study of strong light-matter coupling including
the control of chemical reactions by altering the vibrational normal modes of molecules. In the
vibrational strong coupling regime the normal modes of the system become hybrid modes which mix
nuclear, electronic, and photonic degrees of freedom. First principles methods capable of treating
light and matter degrees of freedom on the same level of theory are an important tool in understanding
such systems. In this work, we develop and apply a generalized force constant matrix approach to
the study of mixed vibration-photon (vibro-polariton) states of molecules based on the cavity
Born-Oppenheimer approximation and quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory.
With this method vibro-polariton modes and infrared spectra can be computed via linear response
techniques analogous to those widely used for conventional vibrations and phonons. We also develop
an accurate model that highlights the consistent treatment of cavity coupled electrons in the vibrational
strong coupling regime. These electronic effects appear as new terms previously disregarded by
simpler models. This effective model also allows for an accurate extrapolation of single and two
molecule calculations to the collective strong coupling limit of hundreds of molecules. We benchmark
these approaches for single and many CO$_2$ molecules coupled to a single photon mode and the iron-pentacarbonyl
Fe(CO)$_5$ molecule coupled to a few photon modes. Our results are the first ab-initio results for
collective vibrational strong coupling effects. This framework for efficient computations of
vibro-polaritons paves the way to a systematic description and improved understanding of the behavior
of chemical systems in vibrational strong coupling.

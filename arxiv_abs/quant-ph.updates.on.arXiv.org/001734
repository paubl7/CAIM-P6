Spontaneous collapse models and Bohmian mechanics are two different solutions to the measurement
problem plaguing orthodox quantum mechanics. They have a priori nothing in common. At a formal level,
collapse models add a non-linear noise term to the Schr\"odinger equation, and extract definite
measurement outcomes either from the wave function (e.g. mass density ontology) or the noise itself
(flash ontology). Bohmian mechanics keeps the Schr\"odinger equation intact but uses the wave
function to guide particles (or fields), which comprise the primitive ontology. Collapse models
modify the predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics, whilst Bohmian mechanics can be argued to
reproduce them. However, it turns out that collapse models and their primitive ontology can be exactly
recast as Bohmian theories. More precisely, considering (i) a system described by a non-Markovian
collapse model, and (ii) an extended system where a carefully tailored bath is added and described
by Bohmian mechanics, the stochastic wave-function of the collapse model is exactly the wave-function
of the original system conditioned on the Bohmian particle positions of the bath. Further, the noise
driving the collapse model is a linear functional of the Bohmian positions. The randomness that
seems progressively revealed in the collapse models lies entirely in the initial conditions in
the Bohmian-like theory. Our construction of the appropriate bath is not trivial and exploits an
old result from the theory of open quantum systems. This reformulation of collapse models as Bohmian
theories brings to the fore the question of whether there exists `unromantic' realist interpretations
of quantum theory that cannot ultimately be rewritten this way, with some guiding law. It also points
to important foundational differences between `true' (Markovian) collapse models and non-Markovian
models.

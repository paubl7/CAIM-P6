We consider a theory of quantum thermodynamics with multiple conserved quantities (or charges).
To this end, we generalize the seminal results of Sparaciari et al. [PRA 96:052112, 2017] to the case
of multiple, in general non-commuting charges, for which we formulate a resource theory of thermodynamics
of asymptotically many non-interacting systems. To every state we associate the vector of its expected
charge values and its entropy, forming the phase diagram of the system. Our fundamental result is
the Asymptotic Equivalence Theorem (AET), which allows us to identify the equivalence classes
of states under asymptotic approximately charge-conserving unitaries with the points of the phase
diagram. Using the phase diagram of a system and its bath, we analyze the first and the second laws
of thermodynamics. In particular, we show that to attain the second law, an asymptotically large
bath is necessary. In the case that the bath is composed of several identical copies of the same elementary
bath, we quantify exactly how large the bath has to be to permit a specified work transformation of
a given system, in terms of the number of copies of the elementary bath systems per work system (bath
rate). If the bath is relatively small, we show that the analysis requires an extended phase diagram
exhibiting negative entropies. This corresponds to the purely quantum effect that at the end of
the process, system and bath are entangled, thus permitting classically impossible transformations.
For a large bath, system and bath may be left uncorrelated and we show that the optimal bath rate, as
a function of how tightly the second law is attained, can be expressed in terms of the heat capacity
of the bath. Our approach, solves a problem from earlier investigations about how to store the different
charges under optimal work extraction protocols in physically separate batteries.

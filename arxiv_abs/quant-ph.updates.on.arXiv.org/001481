We introduce the iterative power algorithm (IPA) for global optimization and a formal proof of convergence
for both discrete and continuous global search problems. IPA implements the power iteration method
in quantics tensor train (QTT) representations. Analogous to the imaginary time propagation method
with infinite mass, IPA starts with an initial probability distribution $\rho_0({\bf r})$ and
iteratively applies the recurrence relation $\rho_{k+1}({\bf r}) = U \rho_k({\bf r})/ \| U \rho_k({\bf
r}) \|_{L^1}$, where $U=e^{-V({\bf r})}$ is defined in terms of the `potential energy' function
$V({\bf r})$ with global minimum at ${\bf r}={\bf r}^*$. Upon convergence, the probability distribution
becomes a delta function $\delta({\bf r}-{\bf r}^*)$, so the global minimum can be obtained as the
position expectation value ${\bf r}^* = \text{Tr}\left[{\bf r} \delta({\bf r}-{\bf r}^*)\right]$.
QTT representations of $V({\bf r})$ and $\rho({\bf r})$ are generated by fast adaptive interpolation
of multidimensional arrays to bypass the curse of dimensionality and the need to evaluate $V({\bf
r})$ for all possible values of ${\bf r}$. We illustrate the capabilities of IPA as applied to solving
the factorization problem formulated as a global search optimization on the "potential energy"
surface $V({\bf r})=\text{mod}(N,{\bf r})$, where $N$ is the number to be factorized and ${\bf
r}\in \{2,3,5,7,11,\dots\}$ is the space of prime numbers folded as a $d$-dimensional $2_1 \times
2_2 \times \cdots \times 2_d$ tensor. We find that IPA resolves multiple degenerate global minima
corresponding to prime factors of $N$ even when separated by large energy barriers in the highly
rugged landscape of $V({\bf r})$. Therefore, IPA should be of great interest for a wide range of other
optimization problems ubiquitous in molecular and electronic structure calculations.

In general relativity, the description of spacetime relies on idealised rods and clocks, which
identify a reference frame. In any concrete scenario, reference frames are associated to physical
systems, which are ultimately quantum in nature. A relativistic description of the laws of physics
hence needs to take into account such quantum reference frames, through which spacetime can be given
an operational meaning. Here, we introduce the notion of a spacetime quantum reference frame, associated
to a quantum particle in spacetime, and we give a manifestly covariant formulation of physical laws
from the perspective of such a quantum reference frame. In particular, we consider a system of $N$
relativistic quantum particles in a weak gravitational field, and introduce a timeless formulation
in which the global state of the $N$ particles appears "frozen", but the dynamical evolution is recovered
in terms of relational quantities. We describe both the external and the internal degrees of freedom
of the particles. The external degrees of freedom are used to fix the quantum reference frame via
a transformation to the local frame of the particle such that the metric is locally flat at the origin
of the quantum reference frame. The internal degrees of freedom are used as clocks keeping the proper
time in the local frame of the particle. We then show how the remaining particles evolve dynamically
in the relational variables from the perspective of the quantum reference frame. The construction
proposed here includes the Page-Wootters mechanism for non interacting clocks when the external
degrees of freedom are neglected. Finally, we find that a quantum superposition of gravitational
redshifts and a quantum superposition of special-relativistic time dilations can be observed
in the quantum reference frame.

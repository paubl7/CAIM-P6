An exciting frontier in quantum information science is the realization and control of complex quantum
many-body systems. Hybrid nanophotonic system with cold atoms has emerged as the paradigmatic
platform for engineering long-range spin models from the bottom up, exploiting their modal geometry
and group dispersion for tailored interactions. An important challenge is the physical limitation
imposed by the photonic bath, constraining the types of local Hamiltonians that decompose the available
physical models and restricting the spatial dimensions to that of the dielectric media. However,
at the nanoscopic scale, atom-field interaction inherently accompanies significant driven-dissipative
quantum forces that may be tamed as a new form of a mediator for controlling the atomic internal states.
Here, we formulate a quantum optics toolbox for constructing a universal quantum matter with individual
atoms in the vicinity of 1D photonic crystal waveguides. The enabling platform synthesizes analog
quantum materials of universal $2$-local Hamiltonian graphs mediated by phononic superfluids
of the trapped atoms. We generalize our microscopic theory of analog universal quantum simulator
to the development of dynamical gauge fields. In the spirit of gauge theories, we investigate emergent
lattice models for strongly coupled SU$(n)$-constrained excitations driven by an underlying
multi-body interaction. As a minimal model in the infrared, we explore the realization of an archetypical
strong coupling quantum field theory, SU($n$) Wess-Zumino-Witten model, and discuss a diagnostic
tool to extract the entire conformal data of the field theory by the static and dynamical correlators
of the fluctuating photons in the guided mode.

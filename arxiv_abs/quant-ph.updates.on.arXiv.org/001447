The second law in thermodynamics dictates which state transformations are statistically unlikely
or effectively forbidden. However, the statistical formulation of the second law assumes the asymptotic
regime, where a system of an asymptotically large number of particles interacts with the thermal
baths. In addition, standard thermodynamics relies on mean values of thermodynamic quantities
and admits thus the possibility of repeated measurements. This formulation cannot be automatically
extended to the finite-size regime, where the system is composed of a small number of particles,
let alone that these particles could be of quantum nature and that only one-shot measurement is allowed.
In this work, we consider heat engines operating in the finite-size regime and allowed to access
one-shot measurements, i.e., the engines are made up of a system with a finite or a small number of
quantum particles and two baths at different temperatures, and convert heat into work. We introduce
generalized engine operations, the semi-local thermal operations, where the system simultaneously
interacts with two baths at different temperatures. We develop a resource theoretic formalism
and show that, unlike in the asymptotic regime, thermodynamics of these quantum heat engines is
fundamentally irreversible, and it requires many second laws to characterize the state transformations.
We construct heat engines that operate with a one-step cycle. These engines improve the one-shot
engine efficiency, compared to the engines operating with local thermal operations. Also, they
can operate by exclusively exploiting the correlations present in the system. We formulate the
statements of various forms of second laws such as one-shot Clausius, Kelvin-Planck, and Carnot
statements in the finite-size regime.

It is known that the classical framework of causal models is not general enough to allow for causal
reasoning about quantum systems. While the framework has been generalized in a variety of different
ways to the quantum case, much of this work leaves open whether causal concepts are fundamental to
quantum theory, or only find application at an emergent level of classical devices and measurement
outcomes. Here, we present a framework of quantum causal models, with causal relations defined
in terms intrinsic to quantum theory, and the central object of study being the quantum process itself.
Following Allen et al., Phys. Rev. X 7, 031021 (2017), the approach defines quantum causal relations
in terms of unitary evolution, in a way analogous to an approach to classical causal models that assumes
underlying determinism and situates causal relations in functional dependences between variables.
We show that any unitary quantum circuit has a causal structure corresponding to a directed acyclic
graph, and that when marginalising over local noise sources, the resulting quantum process satisfies
a Markov condition with respect to the graph. We also prove a converse to this statement. We introduce
an intrinsically quantum notion that plays a role analogous to the conditional independence of
classical variables, and (generalizing a central theorem of the classical framework) show that
d-separation is sound and complete for it in the quantum case. We present generalizations of the
three rules of the classical do-calculus, in each case relating a property of the causal structure
to a formal property of the quantum process, and to an operational statement concerning the outcomes
of interventions. In addition, we introduce and derive similar results for classical split-node
causal models, which are more closely analogous to quantum causal models than the classical causal
models that are usually studied.

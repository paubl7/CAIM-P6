Simulating quantum dynamics is expected to be performed more easily on a quantum computer than on
a classical computer. However, the currently available quantum devices lack the capability to
implement fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for quantum simulation. Hybrid classical quantum
algorithms such as the variational quantum algorithms have been proposed to effectively use current
term quantum devices. One promising approach to quantum simulation in the noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) era is the diagonalisation based approach, with some of the promising examples being
the subspace Variational Quantum Simulator (SVQS), Variational Fast Forwarding (VFF), fixed-state
Variational Fast Forwarding (fs-VFF), and the Variational Hamiltonian Diagonalisation (VHD)
algorithms. However, these algorithms require a feedback loop between the classical and quantum
computers, which can be a crucial bottleneck in practical application. Here, we present the Classical
Quantum Fast Forwarding (CQFF) as an alternative diagonalisation based algorithm for quantum
simulation. CQFF shares some similarities with SVQS, VFF, fs-VFF and VHD but removes the need for
a classical-quantum feedback loop and controlled multi-qubit unitaries. The CQFF algorithm does
not suffer from the barren plateau problem and the accuracy can be systematically increased. Furthermore,
if the Hamiltonian to be simulated is expressed as a linear combination of tensored-Pauli matrices,
the CQFF algorithm reduces to the task of sampling some many-body quantum state in a set of Pauli-rotated
bases, which is easy to do in the NISQ era. We run the CQFF algorithm on existing quantum processors
and demonstrate the promise of the CQFF algorithm for current-term quantum hardware.

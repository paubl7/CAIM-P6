In this work, we explicate a new approach for eliminating renormalization scale and scheme (RSS)
dependence in physical observables. We develop this approach by matching RSS dependent observables
to a theory which is independent of both these forms of dependencies. We term the fundamental basis
behind this approach as the Principle of Observable Effective Matching (POEM), which entails matching
of a scale and scheme dependent observable with the fully physical and dynamical scale (PS) dependent
theory at the tree and at higher loop orders at which RSS independence is guaranteed. This is aimed
towards achieving so-called "effective" RSS independent expressions, as the resulting dynamical
dependence is derived from a particular order in RSS dependent perturbation theory. With this matching
at a PS at which the coupling (and masses) are experimentally determined at this scale, and we obtain
an "Effective Theoretical Observable (ETO)", a finite-order RSS independent version of the RSS
dependent observable. We illustrate our approach with a study of the cross section $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$
for $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow$ hadrons, which is demonstrated to achieve scale and scheme independence
utilizing the 3- and 4-loop order $\overline{MS}$ scheme expression in QCD perturbation theory
via matching at both one-loop and two-loop orders for obtaining the ETO. At the tree-loop matching,
we find the value of the RSS independent coupling $a_{eff}^{4L}(\Lambda_{eff})$ at the cutoff
$\Lambda_{eff}$ of the ETO observable, which is RSS independent. With two-loop matching, we obtain
an ETO prediction of $\frac{3}{11}R_{e^{+}e^{-}}^{eff}=1.052363_{-0.0006}^{+0.0006}$ at
$Q=31.6 GeV$, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of $\frac{3}{11}R_{e^{+}e^{-}}^{exp}=1.0527_{-0.005}^{+0.005}$.

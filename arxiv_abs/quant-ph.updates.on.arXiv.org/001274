The Morris-Shore (MS) transformation is a powerful tool for decomposition of the dynamics of multistate
quantum systems to a set of two-state systems and uncoupled single states. It assumes two sets of
states wherein any state in the first set can be coupled to any state in the second set but the states
within each set are not coupled between themselves. Another important condition is the degeneracy
of the states in each set, although all couplings between the states from different sets can be detuned
from resonance by the same detuning. The degeneracy condition limits the application of the MS transformation
in various physically interesting situations, e.g. in the presence of electric and/or magnetic
fields or light shifts, which lift the degeneracy in each set of states, e.g. when these sets comprise
the magnetic sublevels of levels with nonzero angular momentum. This paper extends the MS transformation
to such situations, in which the states in each of the two sets are nondegenerate. To this end, we develop
an alternative way for the derivation of Morris-Shore transformation, which can be applied to non-degenerate
sets of states. We present a generalized eigenvalue approach, by which, in the limit of small detunings
from degeneracy, we are able to generate an effective Hamiltonian that is dynamically equivalent
to the non-degenerate Hamiltonian. The effective Hamiltonian can be mapped to the Morris-Shore
basis with a two-step similarity transformation. After the derivation of the general framework,
we demonstrate the application of this technique to the popular Lambda three-state system, and
the four-state tripod, double-Lambda and diamond systems. In all of these systems, our formalism
allows us to reduce their quantum dynamics to simpler two-state systems even in the presence of various
detunings, e.g. generated by external fields of frequency drifts.

When an open quantum system is coupled to a noninteracting environment, the interaction disturbance
starts to propagate and gradually involves more and more environment modes. This leads to a spread
of entanglement and to a combinatorial growth of complexity. However one expects this process to
be balanced by a continuous emergence of modes which are effectively and irreversibly decoupled
from the future motion of open quantum system. In this work it is demonstrated that this is indeed
the case. Under controlled and exponentially converging approximations, we show that each infinitesimal
time interval one new (incoming) mode gets coupled to open system, and one new (outgoing) mode gets
irreversibly decoupled. Moreover, only a few 'relevant' modes (3 - 4 in the considered cases) are
non-negligibly coupled to the future quantum motion. This way we obtain a complete characterization
of the structure of entanglementemerging in real time. The quantum complexity survives only in
the relevant modes and it saturates on long times. In other words, the dissipative quantum motion
is efficiently computable on a classical computer. The time plays the role of a renormalization
group (RG) flow parameter: the emerging outgoing modes are not entangled to the future real-time
flow, thus they are the 'irrelevant' degrees of freedom. They can be iteratively traced out during
the evolution. Another interesting opportunity is to measure them. This results in a stochastic
RG, in which the irrelevant modes collapse to a measurement signal as soon as they emerge in real-time.
While being a promising Monte-Carlo simulation method, this yields a characterization of the non-Markovian
decoherence: the entanglement which is irreversibly decoupled from the future quantum motion
is equivalent to a statistical ensemble of classical records. We provide simulations of the spin-boson
model for various spectral densities.

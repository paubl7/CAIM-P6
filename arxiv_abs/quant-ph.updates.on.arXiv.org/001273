Solving hard problems is one of the most important issues in computing to be addressed by a quantum
computer. Previously, we have shown that the H-SEARCH; which is the problem of finding a Hadamard
matrix (H-matrix) among all possible binary matrices of corresponding order, is a hard problem
that can be solved by a quantum computer. However, due to the limitation on the number of qubits and
connections in present day quantum processors, only low orders H-SEARCH are implementable. In
this paper, we show that by adopting classical construction/search techniques of the H-matrix,
we can develop new quantum computing methods to find higher order H-matrices. Especially, the Turyn-based
quantum computing method can be further developed to find an arbitrarily high order H-matrix by
balancing the classical and quantum resources. This method is potentially capable to find some
unknown H-matrices of practical and scientific interests, where a classical computer alone cannot
do because of the exponential grow of the complexity. We present some results of finding H-matrix
of order more than one hundred and a prototypical experiment to find even higher order matrix by using
the classical-quantum resource balancing method. Although heuristic optimizations generally
only achieve approximate solutions, whereas the exact one should be determined by exhaustive listing;
which is difficult to perform, in the H-SEARCH we can assure such exactness in polynomial time by
checking the orthogonality of the solution. Since quantum advantage over the classical computing
should have been measured by comparing the performance in solving a problem up to a definitive solution,
the proposed method may lead to an alternate route for demonstrating practical quantum supremacy
in the near future.

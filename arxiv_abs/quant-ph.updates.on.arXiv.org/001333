Fundamental quantum electrodynamical (QED) processes such as spontaneous emission and electron-photon
scattering encompass a wealth of phenomena that form one of the cornerstones of modern science and
technology. Conventionally, calculations in QED and in other field theories assume that incoming
particles are single-momentum states. The possibility that coherent superposition states, i.e.
"shaped wavepackets", will alter the result of fundamental scattering processes is thereby neglected,
and is instead assumed to sum to an incoherent (statistical) distribution in the incoming momentum.
Here, we show that free-electron wave-shaping can be used to engineer quantum interferences that
alter the results of scattering processes in QED. Specifically, the interference of two or more
pathways in a QED process (such as photon emission) enables precise control over the rate of that
process. As an example, we apply our concept to Bremsstrahlung, a ubiquitous phenomenon that occurs,
for instance, in X-ray sources for state-of-the-art medical imaging, security scanning, materials
analysis, and astrophysics. We show that free electron wave-shaping can be used to tailor both the
spatial and the spectral distribution of emitted photons, enhancing their directionality and
monochromaticity, and adding more degrees of freedom that make emission processes like Bremsstrahlung
more versatile. The ability to tailor the spatiotemporal attributes of photon emission via quantum
interference provides a new degree of freedom in shaping radiation across the entire electromagnetic
spectrum. More broadly, the ability to tailor general QED processes through the shaping of free
electrons opens up new avenues of control in processes ranging from optical excitation processes
(e.g., plasmon and phonon emission) in electron microscopy to free electron lasing in the quantum
regime.

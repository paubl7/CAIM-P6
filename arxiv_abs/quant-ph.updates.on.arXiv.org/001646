Entanglement plays a prominent role in the study of condensed matter many-body systems: Entanglement
measures not only quantify the possible use of these systems in quantum information protocols,
but also shed light on their physics. However, exact analytical results remain scarce, especially
for systems out of equilibrium. In this work we examine a paradigmatic one-dimensional fermionic
system that consists of a uniform tight-binding chain with an arbitrary scattering region near
its center, which is subject to a DC bias voltage at zero temperature. The system is thus held in a current-carrying
nonequilibrium steady state, which can nevertheless be described by a pure quantum state. Using
a generalization of the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture, we present an exact calculation of the bipartite
entanglement entropy of a subsystem with its complement, and show that the scaling of entanglement
with the length of the subsystem is highly unusual, containing both a volume-law linear term and
a logarithmic term. The linear term is related to imperfect transmission due to scattering, and
provides a generalization of the Levitov-Lesovik full counting statistics formula. The logarithmic
term arises from the Fermi discontinuities in the distribution function. Our analysis also produces
an exact expression for the particle-number-resolved entanglement. We find that although to leading
order entanglement equipartition applies, the first term breaking it grows with the size of the
subsystem, a novel behavior not observed in previously studied systems. We apply our general results
to a concrete model of a tight-binding chain with a single impurity site, and show that the analytical
expressions are in good agreement with numerical calculations. The analytical results are further
generalized to accommodate the case of multiple scattering regions.

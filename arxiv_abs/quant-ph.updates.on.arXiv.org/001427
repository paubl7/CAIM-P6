Quantum computing is an emerging field of science which will eventually lead us to new and powerful
logic devices with capabilities far beyond the limits of current transistor-based technology.
There are certain types of problems which quantum computers can solve fundamentally faster than
the tradition digital computers. There are quantum algorithms which require both superposition
and entanglement (e.g. Shor algorithm). But neither the Grover algorithm nor the very first quantum
algorithm due to Deutsch and Jozsa need entanglement. Is it possible to utilize classical wave superposition
to speedup database search? This interesting question was analyzed by S. Lloyd. It was concluded
that classical devices that rely on wave interference may provide the same speedup over classical
digital devices as quantum devices. There were several experimental works using optical beam superposition
for emulating Grover algorithm. It was concluded that the use of classical wave superposition comes
with the cost of exponential increase of the resources. Since then, it is widely believed that the
use of classical wave superposition for quantum algorithms is inevitably leading to an exponential
resources overhead (number of devices, power consumption, precision requirements). In this work,
we describe a classical Oracle machine which utilizes classical wave superposition for database
search and data processing. We present experimental data on magnetic database search using spin
wave superposition. The data show a fundamental speedup over the digital computers without any
exponential resource overhead. We argue that in some cases the classical wave-based approach may
provide the same speedup in database search as quantum computers.

We study many-body localization (MBL) in a one-dimensional system of spinless fermions with a deterministic
aperiodic potential in the presence of long-range interactions decaying as power-law $V_{ij}/(r_i-r_j)^\alpha$
with distance and having random coefficients $V_{ij}$. We demonstrate that MBL survives even for
$\alpha <1$ and is preceded by a broad non-ergodic sub-diffusive phase. Starting from parameters
at which the short-range interacting system shows infinite temperature MBL phase, turning on random
power-law interactions results in many-body mobility edges in the spectrum with a larger fraction
of ergodic delocalized states for smaller values of $\alpha$. Hence, the critical disorder $h_c^r$,
at which ergodic to non-ergodic transition takes place increases with the range of interactions.
Time evolution of the density imbalance $I(t)$, which has power-law decay $I(t) \sim t^{-\gamma}$
in the intermediate to large time regime, shows that the critical disorder $h_{c}^I$, above which
the system becomes diffusion-less (with $\gamma \sim 0$) and transits into the MBL phase is much
larger than $h_c^r$. In between $h_{c}^r$ and $h_{c}^I$ there is a broad non-ergodic sub-diffusive
phase, which is characterized by the Poissonian statistics for the level spacing ratio, multifractal
eigenfunctions and a non zero dynamical exponent $\gamma \ll 1/2$. The system continues to be sub-diffusive
even on the ergodic side ($h < h_c^r$) of the MBL transition, where the eigenstates near the mobility
edges are multifractal. For $h < h_{0}<h_c^r$, the system is super-diffusive with $\gamma >1/2$.
The rich phase diagram obtained here is unique to random nature of long-range interactions. We explain
this in terms of the enhanced correlations among local energies of the effective Anderson model
induced by random power-law interactions.

We investigate topological order on fractal geometries embedded in $n$ dimensions. In particular,
we diagnose the existence of the topological order through the lens of quantum information and geometry,
i.e., via its equivalence to a quantum error-correcting code with a macroscopic code distance or
the presence of macroscopic systoles in systolic geometry. We first prove a no-go theorem that $\mathbb{Z}_N$
topological order cannot survive on any fractal embedded in 2D. For fractal lattice models embedded
in 3D or higher spatial dimensions, $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological order survives if the boundaries
of the interior holes condense only loop or membrane excitations. Moreover, for a class of models
containing only loop or membrane excitations, and are hence self-correcting on an $n$-dimensional
manifold, we prove that topological order survives on a large class of fractal geometries independent
of the type of hole boundaries. We further construct fault-tolerant logical gates using their connection
to global and higher-form topological symmetries. In particular, we have discovered a logical
CCZ gate corresponding to a global symmetry in a class of fractal codes embedded in 3D with Hausdorff
dimension asymptotically approaching $D_H=2+\epsilon$ for arbitrarily small $\epsilon$, which
hence only requires a space-overhead $\Omega(d^{2+\epsilon})$ with $d$ being the code distance.
This in turn leads to the surprising discovery of certain exotic gapped boundaries that only condense
the combination of loop excitations and gapped domain walls. We further obtain logical $\text{C}^{p}\text{Z}$
gates with $p\le n-1$ on fractal codes embedded in $n$D. In particular, for the logical $\text{C}^{n-1}\text{Z}$
in the $n^\text{th}$ level of Clifford hierarchy, we can reduce the space overhead to $\Omega(d^{n-1+\epsilon})$.
Mathematically, our findings correspond to macroscopic relative systoles in fractals.

Topological measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) enables one to carry out universal
fault-tolerant quantum computation via single-qubit Pauli measurements with a family of large
entangled states called cluster states as resources. Raussendorf's three-dimensional cluster
states (RTCSs) based on the surface codes are mainly considered for topological MBQC. In such schemes,
however, the fault-tolerant implementation of the logical Hadamard, phase ($Z^{1/2}$), and $T$
($Z^{1/4}$) gates which are essential for building up arbitrary logical gates has not been achieved
to date without using state distillation, while the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate does not require
it, to best of our knowledge. State distillation generally consumes many ancillary logical qubits,
thus it is a severe obstacle against practical quantum computing. To solve this problem, we suggest
an MBQC scheme via a family of cluster states called color-code-based cluster states (CCCSs) based
on the two-dimensional color codes instead of the surface codes. We define logical qubits, construct
elementary logical gates, and describe error correction schemes. We show that all the logical Clifford
gates including the CNOT, Hadamard, and phase gates can be implemented fault-tolerantly without
state distillation, although the fault-tolerant $T$ gate still requires it. We further prove that
the minimal number of physical qubits per logical qubit in a CCCS is at most approximately 1.8 times
smaller than the case of an RTCS. We lastly show that the error threshold of MBQC via CCCSs for logical-$Z$
errors is 2.7-2.8%, which is comparable to the value for RTCSs, assuming a simple error model where
physical qubits have $X$-measurement or $Z$ errors independently with the same probability.

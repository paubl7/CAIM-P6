Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) is the most natural framework for the
purpose of quantum simulation, an area of research that is growing with advances in quantum-computing
algorithms and hardware. It, therefore, remains an important task to identify the most accurate,
while computationally economic, Hamiltonian formulation(s) in such theories, considering the
necessary truncation imposed on the Hilbert space of gauge bosons with any finite computing resources.
This paper is a first step toward addressing this question in the case of non-Abelian LGTs, which
further require the imposition of non-Abelian Gauss's laws on the Hilbert space, introducing additional
computational complexity. Focusing on the case of SU(2) LGT in 1+1 D coupled to matter, a number of
different formulations of the original Kogut-Susskind framework are analyzed with regard to the
dependence of the dimension of the physical Hilbert space on boundary conditions, system's size,
and the cutoff on the excitations of gauge bosons. The impact of such dependencies on the accuracy
of the spectrum and dynamics is examined, and the (classical) computational-resource requirements
given these considerations are studied. Besides the well-known angular-momentum formulation
of the theory, the cases of purely fermionic and purely bosonic formulations (with open boundary
conditions), and the Loop-String-Hadron formulation are analyzed, along with a brief discussion
of a Quantum Link Model of the same theory. Clear advantages are found in working with the Loop-String-Hadron
framework which implements non-Abelian Gauss's laws a priori using a complete set of gauge-invariant
operators. Although small lattices are studied in the numerical analysis of this work, and only
the simplest algorithms are considered, a range of conclusions will be applicable to larger systems
and potentially to higher dimensions.

The quantum measurement problem can be regarded as the tension between the two alternative dynamics
prescribed by quantum mechanics: the unitary evolution of the wave function and the state-update
rule (or "collapse") at the instant a measurement takes place. The notorious Wigner's friend gedankenexperiment
constitutes the paradoxical scenario in which different observers (one of whom is observed by the
other) describe one and the same interaction differently, one --the Friend-- via state-update
and the other --Wigner-- unitarily. This can lead to Wigner and his friend assigning different probabilities
to the outcome of the same subsequent measurement. In this paper, we apply the Page-Wootters mechanism
(PWM) as a timeless description of Wigner's friend-like scenarios. We show that the standard rules
to assign two-time conditional probabilities within the PWM need to be modified to deal with the
Wigner's friend gedankenexperiment. We identify three main definitions of such modified rules
to assign two-time conditional probabilities, all of which reduce to standard quantum theory for
non-Wigner's friend scenarios. However, when applied to the Wigner's friend setup each rule assigns
different conditional probabilities, potentially resolving the probability-assignment paradox
in a different manner. Moreover, one rule imposes strict limits on when a joint probability distribution
for the measurement outcomes of Wigner and his Friend is well-defined, which single out those cases
where Wigner's measurement does not disturb the Friend's memory and such a probability has an operational
meaning in terms of collectible statistics. Interestingly, the same limits guarantee that said
measurement outcomes fulfill the consistency condition of the consistent histories framework.

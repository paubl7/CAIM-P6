We present an optomechanical model that describes the stochastic motion of an overdamped chiral
nanoparticle diffusing in the optical bistable potential formed in the standing-wave of two counter-propagating
Gaussian beams. We show how chiral optical environments can be induced in the standing-wave with
no modification of the initial bistability by controlling the polarizations of each beam. Under
this control, optical chiral densities and/or an optical chiral fluxes are generated, associated
respectively with reactive vs. dissipative chiral optical forces exerted on the diffusing chiral
nanoparticle. This optomechanical chiral coupling bias the thermodynamics of the thermal activation
of the barrier crossing, in ways that depend on the nanoparticle enantiomer and on the optical field
enantiomorph. We show that reactive chiral forces, being conservative, contribute to a global,
enantiospecific, change of the Helmholtz free energy bistable landscape. In contrast, when the
chiral nanoparticle is immersed in a dissipative chiral environment, the symmetry of the bistable
potential is broken by non-conservative chiral optical forces. In this case, the chiral electromagnetic
fields continuously transfer, through dissipation, mechanical energy to the chiral nanoparticle.
For this chiral nonequilibrium steady-state, the thermodynamic changes of the barrier crossing
take the form of heat transferred to the thermal bath and yield chiral deracemization schemes that
can be explicitly calculated within the framework of our model. Three-dimensional stochastic
simulations confirm and further illustrate the thermodynamic impact of chirality. Our results
reveal how chiral degrees of freedom both of the nanoparticle and of the optical fields can be transformed
into true thermodynamics control parameters, thereby demonstrating the significance of optomechanical
chiral coupling in stochastic thermodynamics.

We investigate the randomized and quantum communication complexities of the well-studied Equality
function with small error probability $\epsilon$, getting the optimal constant factors in the
leading terms in a number of different models. In the randomized model, 1) we give a general technique
to convert public-coin protocols to private-coin protocols by incurring a small multiplicative
error, at a small additive cost. This is an improvement over Newman's theorem [Inf. Proc. Let.'91]
in the dependence on the error parameter. 2) Using this we obtain a $(\log(n/\epsilon^2)+4)$-cost
private-coin communication protocol that computes the $n$-bit Equality function, to error $\epsilon$.
This improves upon the $\log(n/\epsilon^3)+O(1)$ upper bound implied by Newman's theorem, and
matches the best known lower bound, which follows from Alon [Comb. Prob. Comput.'09], up to an additive
$\log\log(1/\epsilon)+O(1)$. In the quantum model, 1) we exhibit a one-way protocol of cost $\log(n/\epsilon)+4$,
that uses only pure states and computes the $n$-bit Equality function to error $\epsilon$. This
bound was implicitly already shown by Nayak [PhD thesis'99]. 2) We show that any $\epsilon$-error
one-way protocol for $n$-bit Equality that uses only pure states communicates at least $\log(n/\epsilon)-\log\log(1/\epsilon)-O(1)$
qubits. 3) We exhibit a one-way protocol of cost $\log(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon)+3$, that uses mixed
states and computes the $n$-bit Equality function to error $\epsilon$. This is also tight up to an
additive $\log\log(1/\epsilon)+O(1)$, which follows from Alon's result. Our upper bounds also
yield upper bounds on the approximate rank and related measures of the Identity matrix. This also
implies improved upper bounds on these measures for the distributed SINK function, which was recently
used to refute the randomized and quantum versions of the log-rank conjecture.

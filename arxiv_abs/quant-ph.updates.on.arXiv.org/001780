Nuclear spins in certain solids couple weakly to their environment, making them attractive candidates
for quantum information processing and inertial sensing. When coupled to the spin of an optically-active
electron, nuclear spins can be rapidly polarized, controlled and read via lasers and radiofrequency
fields. Possessing coherence times of several milliseconds at room temperature, nuclear spins
hosted by a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond are thus intriguing systems to observe how classical
physical rotation at quantum timescales affects a quantum system. Unlocking this potential is
hampered by precise and inflexible constraints on magnetic field strength and alignment in order
to optically induce nuclear polarization, which restricts the scope for further study and applications.
In this work, we demonstrate optical nuclear spin polarization and rapid quantum control of nuclear
spins in a diamond physically rotating at $1\,$kHz, faster than the nuclear spin coherence time.
Free from the need to maintain strict field alignment, we are able to measure and control nuclear
spins in hitherto inaccessible regimes, such as in the presence of a large, time-varying magnetic
field that makes an angle of more than $100^\circ$ to the nitrogen-lattice vacancy axis. The field
induces spin mixing between the electron and nuclear states of the qubits, decoupling them from
oscillating rf fields. We are able to demonstrate that coherent spin state control is possible at
any point of the rotation, and even for up to six rotation periods. We combine continuous dynamical
decoupling with quantum feedforward control to eliminate decoherence induced by imperfect mechanical
rotation. Our work liberates a previously inaccessible degree of freedom of the NV nuclear spin,
unlocking new approaches to quantum control and rotation sensing.

We describe quantum circuits with only $\widetilde{\cal O}(N)$ Toffoli complexity that block
encode the spectra of quantum chemistry Hamiltonians in a basis of $N$ arbitrary (e.g., molecular)
orbitals. With ${\cal O}(\lambda / \epsilon)$ repetitions of these circuits one can use phase estimation
to sample in the molecular eigenbasis, where $\lambda$ is the 1-norm of Hamiltonian coefficients
and $\epsilon$ is the target precision. This is the lowest complexity that has been shown for quantum
computations of chemistry within an arbitrary basis. Furthermore, up to logarithmic factors,
this matches the scaling of the most efficient prior block encodings that can only work with orthogonal
basis functions diagonalizing the Coloumb operator (e.g., the plane wave dual basis). Our key insight
is to factorize the Hamiltonian using a method known as tensor hypercontraction (THC) and then to
transform the Coulomb operator into an isospectral diagonal form with a non-orthogonal basis defined
by the THC factors. We then use qubitization to simulate the non-orthogonal THC Hamiltonian, in
a fashion that avoids most complications of the non-orthogonal basis. We also reanalyze and reduce
the cost of several of the best prior algorithms for these simulations in order to facilitate a clear
comparison to the present work. In addition to having lower asymptotic scaling spacetime volume,
compilation of our algorithm for challenging finite-sized molecules such as FeMoCo reveals that
our method requires the least fault-tolerant resources of any known approach. By laying out and
optimizing the surface code resources required of our approach we show that FeMoCo can be simulated
using about four million physical qubits and under four days of runtime, assuming $1\,${\textmu}s
cycle times and physical gate error rates no worse than $0.1\%$.

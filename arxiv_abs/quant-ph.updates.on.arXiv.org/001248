Due to their high coherence, Lasers are a ubiquitous tool in science. The standard quantum limit
for the phase coherence time was first introduced by [A. Schawlow and C. Townes, Phys. Rev. 112, 1940
(1958)], who showed that the minimum possible laser linewidth is determined by the linewidth of
the laser cavity divided by twice the number of photons in the cavity. Later, Wiseman showed theoretically
that by using Susskind-Glogower (SG) operators to couple the gain medium to the laser cavity it is
possible to eliminate pump noise, but not loss noise. This decreases the minimum laser linewidth,
though only by a factor of two. In this article, we show that by engineering the coupling between the
laser cavity and the output port it is possible to eliminate most of the loss noise as well and construct
a laser that has a vastly narrower linewidth, narrower than the standard quantum limit by a factor
equal to the number of photons in the laser cavity. We establish a roadmap for building such a device
in the laboratory by using Josephson junctions and linear circuit elements to build coupling circuits
that behave like SG operators for a range of cavity photon occupancies and using them to couple the
laser cavity to both the gain medium and the output port. This device could be an ultra-coherent,
cryogenic light source for microwave quantum information experiments. Further, our laser provides
highly squeezed light and could be modified to provide designer quantum light which is an important
resource for CV/linear optical quantum computing, readout of quantum states in superconducting
quantum computers, quantum metrology, and quantum communication. Finally, our proposal relies
on the tools and elements of superconducting quantum information, and thus is a clear example of
how quantum engineering techniques can inspire us to re-imagine the limits of conventional quantum
systems such as the laser.
